it ’s a rogue court dismantling government institutions to the redcaps benefit vote out maga for the survival of the country
chaos feels like the goal at this point this will be like how the “ failure ” of public schools following decades of underfunding is being used to justify privatization of public education when the government can no longer deliver public policy objectives such as environmental and consumer protections via effective regulatory tools it will become the justification for either eliminating regulatory oversight by and on behalf of the public or completely privatizing it altogether just wait until you get the regulatory equivalent of the donda academy brought to you by the bp bureau of marine protection or the ticketmaster department of consumer affairs and protection
my message to the double haters is this do n't vote for the candidates vote for the lifetime scotus appointments
time to dilute the court
they 're destroying this country trump will deliver the final blow if he wins with decades of a conservative majority in scotus
this is insanity but could you even imagine what happen if the gop had a supermajority in congress we need to vote every member of the republican party out of power and reclaim the courts from the unelected culture warriors who have captured it fuck the gop
what people do n't realize is this was the plan all along this is just the beginning
when james madison wrote the federalist paper 51 he argued that the court would be checked by congress who could vote to approve members who also could impeach them further he thought that the court would respond to public opinion so also be checked by the public 's acceptance or rejection of rulings alas he was wrong he could n't imagine that political parties would conspire across branches to seize total control of government preventing impeachment later hamilton was asked who guards the guardians in terms of scotus he replied it was n't an issue because having neither control of the sword or the purse they would be harmless he could not imagine a court that was devoted to the destruction of liberty not its preservation so our current scotus problem is alas baked into the limitations of our overly idealistic founders
just another day of domination by the three justices who were appointed to the court by a convicted felon and rapist
they are taking away the next administration 's ability to actually do anything literally anything
the fda lawyers in my firm are in a panic about this
i do n't understand why there is not more talk of expanding the court
in the same week they legalized bribery and gave themselves more opportunities to be bribed what an amazing coincidence
the courts are about to be so full of challenges
no worries after some initial chaos scotus will add civil servants to their operations to take over the work of the executive completely
the overturning of chevron is absurd the executive should ignore the ruling especially when it concerns matters of health safety and the biosphere itself
the united states ended in 2016 when trump took power glad i made it out in time
there should be mass protests over this and more focus on this then the debate republicans are crushing our country
you do n't have a country anymore friends all of these decisions will cause a redistribution of voters as democrats move the fuck out of red states and republicans consolidate power in the states they already control states will begin sanctioning each other and some will begin ignoring the supreme court 's decisions schism is inevitable at this point and a cold civil war will disintegrate the union look the fuck out alaskans putin is watching
gay marriage is definitely gone
strangely enough they might have just accidentally legalized drugs on a federal level with this dumbass decision the dea is a regulatory agency and they just gutted the abilities of federal agencies to regulate so while this is a shit decision for numerous reasons they might have just fucked this particular regulation majorly
we can just stop listening to them they ca n't enforce shit
the bought federalist on the supreme court are setting up project 2025 biden harris need to address this
i have n’t seen an article in support of this ruling i ca n’t imagine what reasons you ’d have for supporting it so i ’m curious on what people for this decision cite what are the pros just that unelected people setting the rules but at least in the financial sector are n’t the cfpb enforcing laws anyway if you ’re more adept at google
trying to educate myself more about politics so does this ruling mean that more power is being given to federal instead of states it sounds like the government is trying to take back more control
what the living fuck dude
temporary but lame all the same
is it a wild interpretation of this that the power described here was and is congressional power perhaps the court has more say but not any more than the executive had congress has a job abdicating it is not allowed let congress pass the laws the court interpret and the executive carry out my reading this moves it more towards that general statement
these decisions are going to lead to extremism simply because they 're giving very little recourse other than the extreme options available to people when someone declares themselves king and the people around them agree because they do n't want to make a fuss and give them the keys to the kingdom what else is a peasant to do i see an american troubles in the future if this is nt pushed against by biden and congress except with far more guns either that or we 're heading to a corporate owned state similar to cyberpunk media but without any of the cool stuff
republicans destroy everything they get power in and our country has been in decline every damn time their voters never learn slugs for salt filling the swamp for the last 50 years
the scotus is on the payroll of the people backing project 2025 a convicted felon rapist piece of shit appointed some of them trump 's appointees should be removed full stop the gop is compromised by foreign agents looking to dismantle the usa from the inside out if this does n't stop now it will not stop later
ffs whatever the merits of the decision it only reinforced the separation of powers ensuring that the power of statutory interpretation remains firmly with the judicial branch sad to see that tnr has turned into garbage clickbait
but biden is so old
roberts made his ruling now let him enforce it
and you can bribe them do they 'll legislate from the benches the way you want the kochs are probably happy with their return
we need a long term plan to encourage patriotic americans to move en masse to about 5 of the less populated red states and give us a 60 vote majority in the senate and whatever majority can be mustered in congress what we are seeing did n’t happen overnight this took the conservatives around 20 30 years of grooming their base to think the desires of ceos were their own we need a 20 year plan to end the republican advantage in congress with a dependable majority in congress for even just 4 years we could undo everything the conservatives have done yank every conservative activist off the supreme court enshrine agency independence restore and expand roe and everything else we have to unfuck people moving to wyoming montana west virginia the dakotas and then pr and dc statehood there ’s no other way forward than to attack the conservative advantage in state representstion
where is biden on court expansion this is getting ridiculous the court must “ dilute ” to minimize the political ideology driving the roberts court this is a layup for biden if he just does it
this is a fucking hilarious way to frame this they are “ upending the separation of powers ” by undoing the greatest transfer of constitutional power and greatest antithesis to separation of powers chevron this would be like saying brown v board upended racial harmony
this must be another change in status quo that people craved and desired when they screamed don't threaten me with the supreme court and not vote for hillary in 2016
chevron deference was originally formed in the support of the raegan administration 's lax interpretation of a rule and it was hailed by conservatives with trump term 2 very likely it seems ironic that the liberals are up in arms about the end of it considering the end of deference would restrict the trump administration 's ability relax enforcement of environmental laws merely by interpretation this reduces not increases the whipsaw effect of the entire book of laws changing by interpretation of each administration i feel like i 'm living in crazy town that this is considered a crisis compared to the world turning upside down every four years i mean can anyone read it was rbj herself that ruled that chevron did need to conduct a new source review on emissions and the supreme court overturned her ruling to say no the admin gets to decide what they call a new source
this is where the actual crisis is our options for president suck but it ’ll be these people who dismantle our nation
we have to get rid of these justices or dilute their power
this title is a straight up lie the court did n't upend the separation of powers they precisely did the opposite by saying that congress writes the laws not unelected bureaucrats
congress has the power to fix this but only congress can it is their job to legislate and power balance the scotus
we certainly live in the modern times when we no longer half to worry about the red coats but now the red hats are coming
pack the court or assemble enough power you can disregard them
yes scotus appointments famously work well to rally voter enthusiasm ignore the fact that they have been relevant in nearly every election maybe this time the voters will get it
i voted for obama but rbg did n’t step down and we lost roe as a result
theirs but it has become our lifetimes too if trump gets a second term and replaces alito and thomas with young fanatics the far right will control the court until around 2048 even if they never get another republican president ever again this is based on actuarial tables which probably underestimates the life of a wealthy judge with magic healthcare but of course they will at some point get another r president and if they have the senate at the same time at any time between trump 's hypothetical 2nd term and 2048 they can just repeat the process again they only really need one overlapping senate president once per 15 20 years to hold the court forever if 2nd term biden gets to replace one of those bastards and sotomayor retires we have a chance to take the court back one day if not i do n't think anyone reading this gets to see a left leaning court in their lifetimes barring some black swan event
this honestly has been my personal biggest gripe with biden he needed to go hard and expand the court before and it is even more dire now this supreme court is illegitimate and is usurping the executive branch power he needs to appoint 4 judges asap
decades is optimistic this is multi generational if trump gets elected he has four years to get a gop controlled house and senate if they decide to increase the number of supreme court justices he 'll be able to appoint as many supreme court justices as he wants and knowing him they 'll be in their forties with life time appointments by the time cooler heads are in control of the supreme court again there will be nothing left
hey they media also wants in on this claim oh media is also owned by the people owning the judges
we are already done for honestly half the country still wants trump and collect ar 15s and all the rich people like him as well because good for them
this decision blunts a trump administration from being able to more broadly interpret regulations as they see fit even if it contravenes precedent this ruling could very well save us from some of the horseshit in project 2025 if trump wins
trumps scotus was honestly the best outcome of his presidency hopeful for another four years as there may be another two retirees on the court
except if they get the legislative and executive again based on this ruling congress wo n't matter and they will arrest whoever is already in that that opposes them
they 'll increase the number of supreme court justices and fill them with 40 year old maga loyalists on the federalist 's society 's ideologically pure list at the first opportunity the supreme court is not ever coming back to reason if trump is re elected and if he loses it 's only a delay
the next step according to project 2025 is to start deleting government agencies now that they 're toothless from an enforcement and rule making ability federal agencies no longer have a reason to exist and they 're coming for all of them dept of commerce dept of education dept of energy all first to go on the chopping block when they want to even get rid of the weather service you know you 're f cked who is supposed to put out hurricane or tornado warnings
the question that should have been asked what if all the branches of government are owned by the same people then what recourse do the people have
and yet the answer we have most readily available is right there if they go too far and lose public legitimacy we ignore them and their rulings it 's time for some of that
and biden is a pedo and a groomer
they are not taking away its ability to serve corporate kleptocratic interests they are granting the executive that authority with this ruling and that ’s what this is all about
because no administration got anything done before the rehnquist court invented chevron deference c’m on
yet people using two corners out of the same mouth will tell you that this is the maga court doing this to benefit trump and that trump if elected will yield the executive branch in a fascist manner everyone here who is scared of project 2025 should be ecstatic that this court case happened
tell them to ignore it make that their official policy the absurdity of an illegitimate court ca n't get in the way of matters of public health and safety let them enforce their ruling
biden and congressional democrats should be doing this right now what i find even more puzzling is that no one is even considering that the gop can also expand the supreme court when they are back in control no way in hell they decide that a mere 6 3 is enough when the supreme court justices that maintain their control are so old it would only take two supreme court nominations to break conservative control over the supreme court they 're going to pack the courts themselves to prevent that from happening and put in ideological purists in their 40 's thus guaranteeing control of the supreme court for generations
i do n't understand why we the people are n't out on the streets protesting outside the supreme court yet we must have some great bread and circuses
scotus laughs this gives them even more power fuck john roberts he 's been sowing the end of our democracy since citizens united
lol putin ca n’t even conquer a country they border no way they also have troops to send over the ocean plus guns here out number people by a hefty amount people here regardless of party like their firearms and just want to be left alone
they 're also undermining marriage between american citizens and non citizens acb literally stated that there is no liberty concern for u s citizens regarding their spouse
zero chance nobody is even calling for that what case before the court challenges gay marriage obergefell v hodges is here to stay you might say “ people said that about roe ” but there was a huge national movement to overturn roe as soon as it happened and it was an incredibly divisive issue that made its way immediately into the party platforms that has simply not happened with ovh
michigan might as well secede
dude this literally weakens trumps ability to wield the executive branch how are you all not happy about this lmao
the legislative branch writes the laws the executive branch enforces the laws and the judicial branch interprets the laws chevron was a mandate on the courts to automatically side with the executive branch 's interpretation of a law if the law has an ambiguity it removed a lot of the judicial branches ability to interpret laws of a federal agency was applying a law in a questionable manner the headline of the article is very disingenuous because this ruling actually helps restore the separation of the powers
it is not a bribe it is a tip unfortunately the american people will be taking that tip
sorry you could n’t pay me to move to those states
this is a gross misinterpretation of what happened
the entire time chevron was in effect congress could have passed laws regarding any of these issues if congress passed a law defining the acceptable amount of arsenic in baby food as 300 ppm then that would have been the law that congress delegated that power to the executive branch is not a breakdown in the separation of powers congress passed laws about the goal and let the executive branch determine the means and methods that 's literally what the conservatives under reagan fought in the courts for in 1984 and won
this was written before the republicans just nominated all aileen cannons and the supreme court was n’t getting millions of dollars in tips this is an easy way for them to get rid of any regulation they do n’t want
responding to the second paragraph their friends on the sc would just aide and abet them
what else do you consider rbg better than the rest of the supreme court about since she 's someone whose opinion you respect
these people who were appointed by one of those presidential choices we 're in this situation because people did n't show up in 2016 it 'll only get worse if we do n't show up and vote for biden
send me your address so i can use your backyard to dump my radioactive waste do n't worry i 'm sure congress will quickly pass a law that mentions the exact isotope permissible quantity and physical location your yard that is n't allowed
you ’re missing probably 90 % of the equation here congress can not write laws that cover every single possible edge case and application and they nor judges have expertise on specifics for technical subjects like medicine scotus and you i would really hope understands this and they also understand the inertia congress has had as an institution for decades the direct result of this decision will be lifelong political appointees with law degrees deciding highly technical matters without any expertise it creates a power vacuum to be most often filled by judges not congress if we ’re talking about reality and such it ’s a clear power grab
absolutely and they can we desperately need an activist legislature
agreed if the future opportunity presents itself there needs to be some settled laws precedent impeachments frauds lied their asses off during the confirmation hearings
ok but that would require an overwhelming majority because republicans have no reason to correct this imbalance
but they wo n't because maga wants to burn it all down
it might be time for the nuclear option of packing the court
we desperately need a functioning government two years every decade does n’t cut it republicans will likely get the senate this year maybe in 2030
democrats in congress have been trying to pass legislation for that in addition to numerous supreme court reform bills but they 're just languishing in the maga majority judiciary committee we need to get out the vote and raise awareness of the importance of getting a democratic majority in congress
congress already has that ability scotus has no ability to enforce their opinions just ignore them
we have n't had a presidential election since dobbs look at what has happened recently when abortion is on the ballot even indirectly even in red states
it actually has been but only for republicans why the fuck do you think republicans show up and vote every fucking cycle because of the courts
and if people would have voted for hillary instead of screaming both sides are the same rgb would have been replaced by someone who would n't have help kill roe so the persons point you are responding to still stands
the democratic party was not prepared for or accustomed to the naked power grab and blatant hypocrisy that mcconnell and the republican congress made regarding those supreme court seats yes it seems like it should have been obvious looking back do you think that voting for any of the other candidates that were in the general election would have changed this outcome
you voted for 2 3 of the nonconservative justices remaining on the bench without obama if all other elections went the way they did we 'd be looking at an 8 1 conservative supermajority we probably never would 've gotten obergefell etc
mcconnell would n’t have allowed her seat to be filled
the weird thing about increasing the number of supreme court justices as a topic is that everyone wants the democrats to do it and i agree with that but no one considers that the republicans are likely to do just that regardless of whether biden does it now by not increasing the supreme court now when they can the democrats are just making it all the more potent when the gop does it in the future and they will
it ’s not just biden i ca n’t believe a party with as much power as ours still fumbled the ball for multiple administrations
biden does n't have the power to expand the court only congress can do that
it ’s not “ usurping ” to not defer to exec branch interpretations of statutes
4 years he 's already said he 'll be a dictator
it 's horrifying they read the handmaid 's tale and thought it was a good idea
this ruling could very well save us from some of the horseshit in project 2025 if trump wins source
enjoy having more microplastics in your penis year after year
it ’ll probably be two deaths they wo n’t willingly go until daddy trump is in office
absolutely and the founders knew enough greek roman history to understand that this could happen had famously already occurred to a long standing republic when all the same people led by crassius pompey julius later caesar took the roman republic down
for instance if biden 's epa wants to shut down or litigate corporations x y or z for environmental damages the regulators the people that are supposed to be in charge of protecting and serving penalty to violators have just been effectively neutered that s just one example in a complex system the federal government over sees a vast network of regulators that protect citizens and the enviorment from all sorts of heinous corporate bullshit soon you 'll be able to change yer engine oil right on the beach without 2 fucks given
no they should n't this will make project 2025 easier to enact please learn what it actually does
6 3 on the supreme court are maga loyalists they wo n't even agree to hear cases that impede the trump administration just like they intentionally took on cases that impeded the biden administration you can not separate the supreme court from partisanship
not if they collude in any way you know like scotus is helping trump at the moment
people here seem to think that the new powers they want to create to remedy political failures wo n’t at some point be in the hands of their enemies
republicans will continue to block anything biden or dems tey to accomplish the gop is now the party of no unless i get a tip
we do things will have to get really bad before people take action
putin knows he has won control of the republican party to the point he stopped paying to run his twitter bots
that part was hyperbole putin will probably be dead by the time america becomes vulnerable in the way i 'm describing but if you think the russians have n't been eyeing anwr
there was not a huge national movement there was a small section of christian conservatives backed by big money to make their voices extra loud conservative states that put the abortion issue on the ballot are seeing their citizens vote in favor of protections most not all
this strengthens scotus they 're the regulators now and they 're in for life
because it means trump does n't have to bother with deregulating anything it 's already done trump and the gop do not have to spend any time or political capital to deregulate anything they can move forward with all the other things they want done like firing all the professionals from government and installing trump sycophants and it will be functionally impossible to impose any new regulations like on ai or pollution or medicine states on the other hand will be free to impose new rules on basically anything gay marriage trans or minority rights or anything else we 're sprinting headlong to 1850 that 's not a good thing by the way
no it is exactly what happened read the ruling read the history of chevron deference
yeah and i think reagan and the conservatives were wrong on this issue in the 80s congress should not be able to delegate carter blanch legislative power to the executive branch it is unconstitutional if we want that to be a feature of the government then we should amend the constitution i am in favor of an amendment that allows that while giving the legislative branch authority to override executive branch generated regulation
your example describes the original intention of chevron if congress passed a law stating the fda can regulate how much arsenic is allowed in baby food then courts should n't be making a determination as to how many papers per million is appropriate however the application of chevron has expanded well beyond those situations
the courts do n't write the laws if this results in dysfunction then it 's a necessary fire to light under the ass of congress to start working again a country that can not write modify or clarify laws and merely depends on the shifting interpretations of admin and judicial of a tombstoned book of law from the 1980 's is already over the cliff wile e coyote style and might as well fall sooner or later
but this makes it harder for them to do that under chevron the court could just say sorry this is what the admin thinks so too bad about what the law says it does the opposite of the negative outcome you are describing
lmfao you do n’t understand constitutional law
i think rbj correctly warned that roe v wade would cut short the process to come to a conclusion in written law and that would leave the issue vulnerable to future shifts in legal interpretation
might as well start raising the ppm limit of lead in everyone ’s water i ’m sure congress will eventually help and it definitely wo n’t be too late by then oh and i wonder who will enforce that law maybe the representatives or the president will stop by themselves to help out
he also missing that the administrations have employees who had job interviews and minimum qualifications and background checks and ethics standards and are n’t permitted “ gratuities ” and are gagged by the hatch act and their work can be reviewed and questioned by congress and they can be fired and replaced we ca n’t do any of that with scrotus
you 're wildly wrong congress does n't always write laws for agencies that give them line by line what they can and ca n't regulate they define boundaries and criterias of which they can for example the dea has successfully controlled addictive and harmful substances for many decades from the laws written by congress none of this came from the chevron defense for example you 're acting as if this means federal agencies will no longer be able to regulate that 's not true it means that congress has to regulate them as defined in the constitution and just how we use to regulate them before chevron this wo n't result in more court cases it will result in these federal agencies stopping their absurd ' assumptions ' of law and require them to go back to congress for clarification or new law
with the senate good luck even without any filibuster it would be difficult
okay so let 's get out the fucking vote
yeah that 's a good point but i still predict profound disappointment when those affected red states do not swing how you 'd like them to i 'm done trying to save them from themselves
which is shocking because to people like me it 's been blinding obvious this was the direction they were heading not hard since they have been saying it for decades
this sort of thing makes me wonder if each incoming president will want to double the size of the supreme court each time the party switches things would quickly get unmanageable each new president will want to add a number of justices on the order of 9 2 x starting with x 0 incrementing by 1 each party switch it wo n't take many switches for the number of justices to break 1000 by the 25th switch nearly everyone in the us will be a scotus judge things are going to be packed
lmao it ’s always this hellscape scenario with you guys are you saying that the executive branch had no regulatory power prior to 1984
do any other countries run that way
i know very well what project 2025 does and i support a great deal of it this makes it much harder for a new administration to change the direction of the executive branch and regulations
dude they ruled against him plenty of times you just do n’t pay attention to those times
lmao you think scotus is colluding with trump you guys all selectively ignore any evidence to the contrary you think kbj was colluding with trump when she voted on the recent j6 case
this strengthens all article iii courts and returns regulatory power back to the legislature those are good things
if they ban gay marriage i hope someone sues to ban traditional marriage
you think that chevron will lead to the dissolution of gay marriage i want what you are smoking chevron does n’t magically deregulate the executive branch and it wo n’t be impossible to regulate we will just need to pass actual laws in the legislative branch and allow for the judicial branch to hear cases regarding those laws wow look at that separation of powers what a concept
excuse me no need to be uncivil it gives unilateral power to the constitution and almost unending latitude to corporations even if against the welfare of the public i ’ll thank you to engage in a civil matter from here forward
i ’m very well aware of chevron deference making a logical fallacy predicated on a false assumption does very little to indicate good faith
in that case i look forward to a democratic congress one day passing laws that absolutely seize complete control of all kinds of aspects of government and having an executive branch powerless to apply their own expertise to the application of the laws they pass time to donate to some democratic congressional candidates
they do now they have taken that power for themselves will congress do anything to check the judiciary
their goal is no regulation on businesses it does n’t matter what law you write because it will make its way to the supreme court and they will find it unconstitutional
ginsberg her name was ruth bader ginsburg
that ’s certainly the unspoken intent for conservatives there ’s no need for your platform to be popular when the judges who will make policy decisions are unaccountable and then they have the gall to say this is about being true to the constitution
this will absolutely result in more court cases i ’m incredibly tempted to set a reminder to come back to this thread
we do n't have to save red states we have to keep abortion top of mind in purple ones
texas is actually purple leaning blue it just needs to figure out how to vote that way
at that point the idea of randomly selecting federal judges to sit temporarily on the supreme court sounds viable and it would be entirely constitutional to do so
hey smarty pants this is already a thing hellscape scenario is here dumdum
lmao it ’s always this hellscape scenario with you guys are you saying that the executive branch had no regulatory power prior to 1984 no i am saying that in 1984 the reagan administration was correct
i ’m shocked to hear the person who does n’t understand the decision supports project 2025 shocked i say
they ruled against his false election suits because they were faulty arguments they gave his administration wide latitude though far more than they gave the biden administration which was n't even allowed to modify or waive student loan debt even though the statute explicitly gave the department of education the authority to
they want trump gop in power there ’s no reason to slow walk the immunity ruling given it ’s of national interest like preventing a traitor criminal from holding office believe it or not democrat justices do n’t just make up interpretations that benefit them and their objectives in the same way keep supporting the traitor
the expertise needed to regulate does not exist in our courts or legislature our overwhelmed and lack of urgency processes will make doing business and life more inefficient and controled bought by a few
it means if a law does not specifically say something the government ca n't do anything about it internet regulation did not get updated for about two decades do yu think anything changed over that time instead of experts making decisions based on the latest scientific evidence you 'll have politicians signing off whatever lobbyists put in front of them and once it 's there it 'll never get updated but maybe that 's what you want you 'll have politicians making decisions about highly technical things that they know nothing about case in point this decision had to be amended because kavanaugh does n't know the difference between nitrous oxide and nox 's it also means that conservatives who know less than nothing about human reproduction will be making decisions about health we 've seen in texas how well that 's going text the%20researchers'%20analysis%20of%20monthly year%20increase%20of%20255%20deaths how does it affect gay marriage people who are in gay marriages may not have any rights now discrimination in housing jobs access legal protections and medical protection and advocacy may not exist any more they will be dependent on whatever whackadoodle 5th circuit judge decides fof the entire country that day the damage about to be done is going yo be immense in a decade there 's going to be a financial crash on the order of 2008 because all the guardrails enacted after it no longer exist and hope you grow all your own food fda regs are now all out the window too so yeah it 's a bigger deal than the debate
oh if you say so
it gives unilateral power to the constitution and you think that ’s a bad thing explain how it gives unending latitude to corporations do n’t you think it is responsible for one branch of government to not have unilateral authority to be judge jury and executioner in the creation interpretations and judicial process over regulation
i am in favor of as weak of an executive branch of government as possible the executive branch has way too much unilateral authority over our government and leaves our government weak to potential tyrannical leadership
i do n't know how you can possibly say this is the courts writing laws it 's reading laws for what they say
court cases will only happen if these federal agencies continue to try and make their own laws without congressional oversight if they do then they deserve to get struck down by the courts that 's kinda how our three branches of government has worked for the past 250 years
why i know that my state will defend it here straight into federal illegality i have more pressing issues in my life like my electric bill
it 's gerrymandered and voter suppressed to hell
that 's a golden goose i doubt we will see anytime soon i mean if we did the foundation of our elections is changed but i really think it 's fentanyl strength hopium
i must admit it would be somewhat interesting to write out my own recognized judicial opinion as a supreme court justice alongside a couple other million people
wow that sounds awful and something we are universally opposed to let ’s use our constitutionally derived process to write a law pass it in both branches of congress and then sign it into law and allow the judicial system to arbitrate cases brought up questioning the execution and interpretation of the law you know like what the constitution says
“ hey the biden administration gave me authority to violate the constitution why is the supreme court blocking me ” is not the argument you think it is lmao
i am completely fine with a less urgent system of imposing regulation and fines if there is something truly pressing that needs immediate interpretation it will happen expeditiously in our constitutionally derived process you ca n’t just break the constitution because it is not functioning the way you want it to we have an amendment process for that very reason which is meant to be cumbersome so that way you do n’t have tyrannical changes in our government
when the power goes to experts and not politicians beholden to lobbies you bet your ass i do are we just going to pretend the same people who who let gun violence rampage because of the nra have our best interest at heart chevron was created for a reason and taking power away from experts and forcing nearly impossible specificity for enforcement is a dangerous thing
i am in favor of a strong executive branch that can adapt to the times and can act in the national interest in accordance to the guidance provided by laws passed by congress chevron guts that now the executive branch is subservient to the judicial and the legislative branch and since the legislative branch is and will continue to be gridlocked that only leaves the courts to decide and the ones making the decisions were never elected and are in power for life there is already tyranny in leadership this just makes who we elect president matter less
the law says congress delegated certain powers of regulation to the executive with the understanding that scientists and other experts can craft better and more timely rules than the legislature it 's pretty fucking clear going back to the foundation of the epa this is an egregious violation of separation of powers do you really want to see courts getting into the business of deciding administrative policy because that 's exactly what this is a setup for next we 'll have fda approvals for specific drugs decided or overturned by court cases with zero input from doctors or scientists
that is a freshman civics class level of understanding edit do you actually believe the courts will follow the suggestion in the opinion to avoid existing chevron decided matters that is a laughable thought
you realize everyone pays bills he ’s saying do what you can
i think getting out good information can still help too many people believe that gerrymandering makes voting pointless but that 's not true and if more people understood our vote does matter texas could break free from the stranglehold of maga corruption i live in a ludicrously gerrymandered district in texas my vote still counts for the president and the senate as well as statewide positions including the texas state supreme court governor attorney general and numerous other statewide and local positions including vital positions in the judiciary and education system i can not stress enough how important it is to vote all the way down the ballot voter suppression is very real but having good information can make a big difference there as well double checking registration prior to the deadline to make sure it has n't been purged making sure we have necessary identification familiarizing ourselves with our voting rights double checking our voting location in case it 's been moved voting early if possible and going prepared for the weather a long wait working together to help each other out with things like transportation and childcare if necessary
why in the everloving fuck do you want us to have to deal with trying to get legislation through a gridlocked congress in order to avoid having toxins in our drinking water have you given even a moment 's thought to this congress is full of geriatrics who think the internet is a series of tubes and you think they have the mental capacity to weigh in on pfas levels you want us to have to pass a law for every single pollutant instead of deferring to scientists who study them for a living jesus christ
i see this as a power grab
there was gin violence let 's not make changes it is time for prayer we will talk about gun regulation once the families have had a chance greaves or tomorrow whatever comes last wait there was gun violence somewhere else we 'll this is a time for reflection not to make hasty gun control decisions let 's do that tomorrow rinse and repeat
you ’re telling me “ experts ” in the executive branch ca n’t be beholden to corporate interests like when the head of the fcc under obama was previously a lobbyist for communications companies before getting appointed
this just makes who we elect as president matter less good that is how our constitution was designed if you do n’t like that then we should change the constitution imagine a world where there is not panic over who is elected president imagine not having to worry about “ the end of democracy as we know it ” every time the presidency changes hands
so you think rbg was wrong on chevron
i agree with you it 's just frustrating to me when i see what looks like blanket statements about tx blue voters when things are so stacked against them that 's so much work for the average person in wa i can just mail in my ballot
i do n’t think we should throw out the constitution for convenience ’s sake if our system of government is ineffective there is a method to change our system of government why should any tyrannical politician get to change the way our government works
it ’s only a “ power grab ” as it returns power back to the legislature and judiciary as it was constitutionally designed
the same one that moved forward on net neutrality you ’re making a straw man let ’s try to stick to refuting my argument instead of arguing against something else yes unless you ’re only capable of incivility and arguing in bad faith
so you want the country to be just a loose association of states all more or less doing their own thing
imagine a world where 6 unelected people with lifetime appointments and can receive financial rewards for how they rule instead have that power and were hand picked to advance one particular ideological agenda if the supreme court was meant to have that kind of power it would be granted in the constitution it absolutely is not
i would certainly love for things to be easier most other wealthy countries make better participation much less difficult i was raised to believe that voting is a civic responsibility and a precious right that countless people have fought and died to protect i 've always been a consistent voter for that reason but honestly even if i did n't already feel that way the voter suppression attempts would just make me more determined to vote i could be wrong but it seems to me that the more desperately they try to suppress the vote and they seem pretty desperate right now the more i 'm convinced that they 're running scared because they 're afraid they might be about to lose their grip
the tyranny of clean water regulations oh the humanity i used to consider myself a libertarian in college before i got out in the real world and realized this simple equation money buys power why on earth would you be so short sighted as to hand over your children 's future to people who only care about next quarter 's profits this libertarian hellscape that you folks want to inflict on american citizens will affect every single one of us including you and your family
probably a little late to the party on this one but the movie “ ” comes to mind here “ that ’s not what we ’re talking about ” “ but that ’s what i ’m talking about i ’m not after you i ’m after them ”
i 'm not american but i saw one rambling old guy with decent ideas and one absolutely crazy old guy lying constantly spewing hate and nonsense biden was n't on his a game he fumbled a bit but trump was fucking horrible like he did n't answer the questions and just kept talking about immigrants it was actually funny
just another episode of trump tells 397 bold faced lies and how this is bad for biden
well yes the liar delivered the messages that his supporters wanted to hear the other guy scared the crap out of his supporters
silver lining better to fuck up yesterday than later biden is getting on in years but i also think the democrats in general was maybe relaxing a bit too much due to trump 's conviction in ny several weeks ago biden 's bungling also strongly reminded me that everyone has very limited brain bandwidth which in turn further reminded me of other psychological barriers that make it so dang hard to get people with disagreements on the same page
it ’s not that trump “ won ” it ’s a matter of how poor biden ’s performance was it straight shook democrats seeing him so low energy and fumbling if he had made all the same statements and mistakes but delivered like he did the very next day we would n’t be having this conversation
while troubling technically if we ’re looking at it as a debate i ’m not sure they ’re wrong the winner of a debate is n’t based on who is spitting out the most facts it ’s often who is conveying their point more confidently if one party is up there telling lies it ’s the other sides responsibility to point it out and prove argue the truth the fact biden could n’t seem to do that on the most basic leve against someone it should be easy to do it against is precisely why he “ lost ” the debate now would it have been nice if a moderator would have made trump support his claims yes but that was n’t happening so it was up to biden and it sucks because you can imagine how stupid trump would look up against someone quick witted informed and charismatic just because biden is not those things does not mean he should n’t be president but it would have been great for this setting
in a debate the debater who makes points that are largely unchallenged is typically the winner trump lied through his teeth the entire time biden did very little to counter that it ’s called sophistry and it ’s as poor a measure of truth as it ever was yet truth is n’t the measure of debate victory it never has been
ok lawrence 's first point is a little misleading sure only 1 3 of voters watched the debate live but these days most people wait for the clips to appear on the internet so i 'd say a lot more voters saw those clips and his second point is even scarier most of the presidency is not emergencies ok but what about when it is that 's when we need our president to be compus mentis most do n't get me wrong i 'll still vote for biden over trump but cmon lawrence
this is american politics where truth is relative its more important to be loud than right
this is why i did n't watch it it was obvious what was going to happen and the reaction was obvious too there 's no point in trying to reason with america america has a need for really feeling the wrath of their poor decisions in the conservative sub they were going nuts about how biden is a national security threat no he 's not a person who steals top secret documents and keeps them at random locations for some unknown reason is a national security threat that 's literally what a national security threat is trump has already performed the action i 'm off left and right i do n't think anyone believes in anything anymore i just want reason calling one person a national security threat for not actually carrying out a threat while ignoring someone who actually carries out a national security threat that we still do n't know the depths of is unreasonable i just want reason back trump has made his followers unreasonable and illogical nothing they do or say makes sense they do n't even follow their own words you ca n't tell me the majority of this country wants to be led by people like that
the crazy thing to me over this past two days is the new york times editorial board the board made a graph showing how they all said trump “ won ” the debate with only two saying it was a “ draw ” i knew the nyt and the biden administration had their issues but that just showed how absolutely gone this publication is right now
he did win that 's the problem he could get up there and take a shit and his supporters will vote for him biden fucked up he was sundowning and it showed not only that 15 minutes after the debate we had kamala trying to do cleanup give it 24 hours so you know what the public response is the really worrying thing is how every liberal news outlet was immediately saying we need to replace biden nothing instills hope like that so what i 'm worried about is the fact trump seemed like his usual self a lying ass and democrats are now freaking out thinking biden is just done now look at how divided democrats are now some think we need new options others think joe is fine i hope we get another debate because it 's probably cynical but after that i predict record low turnout and a trump win or a biden presidency that declines followed by 8 years of republican fallout
it ’s unfortunate that this is the country we ’ve got at the moment
yeah because he won the debate biden turned his age into the biggest issue of the election it can not be overstated how catastrophically biden fucked up here
one aspect of for profit tv is how the debate becomes a match instead of scrutinizing policies we scrutinize their performance
you know you are dealing with a profession liar when they say “ they said they tell me they all feel ” it ’s easiest the single worst argument yet no direct follow up as to who demonstrating zero critical thinking they are actually the liar trying to suggest a large support group behind the thought the past 24 hours have literally impacted my overall sense of well being it brought back 4 years of feeling that way have decided to tune it all out i will vote as i will and continue to live my life outside this toxic national political bubble wishing all who read this a great weekend we all deserve that regardless of beliefs or affiliations
listen that debate was so devoid of any iota of substance or integrity biden made points that were fine but i could barely understand them and often did n’t trump just lied because that ’s all he does when he opens his mouth at the end of the day biden and trump were fighting different wars in the public eye if you ’re undecided it ’s only because you do n’t know whether trump being a fascist lunatic or biden being a firm breeze away from death is of more concern i find it difficult to believe either won anyone over but biden feels like he may have pushed some away there has never been a presidential debate performance as terribly poor as joe biden ’s since we ’ve had a record of them frankly it ’s not even close biden has a voter base that ’s behind him if trump ’s batshit wildly harmful views and policy approaches are making you vote biden the debate does n’t matter if you think trump is the second coming of christ the debate does n’t matter the debate only has a real work effect through the undecided voters who went into that debate to see who they felt could lead the country hopefully they all hear the nonstop hatred spewing forth from trump but i find it difficult to blame anyone who does n’t feel great about biden ’s competency after that shitshow
bidens follow up rally was night and day i wish he was like that during the debate
it 's the correct interpretation based on historical precedent that was a disaster the debate rubric is different for republicans and dems it is what it is we 're more discerning voters than they are that said we 're going to vote biden anyway he 's not my pick by a long shot but he gets my vote anyway
either it was a debate and trump disqualified himself by veering off topic and lying or it was an improv competition and biden got his ass whooped
incredible attempt to spin this in less than 24 hours yes lets all gaslight ourselves and making us doubt what we saw that 's the way
i do n’t want trump in office again ever but biden was not just off his game he showed very clear evidence of significant cognitive decline and pretending that ai nt so is not going to cut it democrats need a new candidate now
journalism is dead and not yesterday
that 's because the debate winner in america is who 's more confident not who 's spoken the most truth or sense the moderators let loads of things slide and did n't press for answers when their questions were avoided shocking performance from them
perception matters for better or worse
people expected trump to lie and he did n't disappoint whoppers served up with more consistency and energy that he has managed during his rallies
he should never have been on the ticket con man convicted felon
the racist rapist and felon who claims to represent people that he screws over with his policies the dumb is strong in these ones
biden lied in this debate too granted not anywhere near as much as orange man but he still lied over half a dozen times i think both candidates had poor performances but i see a lot of people on here downplaying biden ’s performance the 1 concern with biden the entire time has been concerns over his cognitive abilities and he did n’t do anything to make people feel better about that if anything i think he made people feel worse about it also this is n’t just him mumbling and stuttering and losing train of thought people keep bringing up trump ’s embarassing statement about “ post term ” abortions and the gov of virginia did everyone not also hear biden ’s weird tangent about incest and “ getting raped by your sister ” i mean come on the whole abortion thing is a key democratic point and an easy w for democrats and he threw up all over himself
we ’re the voters we ’re supposed to speak up if the options given to us are terrifying
we live in a country where dems will literally blame the debate format before acknowledging their candidate is ass biden is running a finger pointing campaign and is n't buying students votes like last round add in gaza absolute lost cause but yeah blame the format
that would be becasue biden obviously lost trump ran circles around him completely unchallenged
commentary which is bought and paid for by the 1 % and spread thru their bots
because trump did win buying is not about facts it 's about feelings we then use facts to justify those feelings biden needs to quit and release his delegates kamala would probably end up being the nominee but at least she can fight joe is done
the world can not afford another four years of trump the democrats are sleepwalking into disaster but seemingly will do nothing
the question is if the needle moved due to the debate if it moved toward trump which seems possible then he won regardless of the fact that he is a brain dead shitbag the declaring of a winner is n’t a popularity thing it ’s an analysis of the effect the debate had on the electorate commentators that declared trump the winner are n’t doing so because they liked what he said they think biden damaged himself more than trump did i unfortunately agree with them i would be surprised if biden is the nominee in november changing the candidate this late in the game night galvanize the left as most of the problems biden is having are his israel response and his age both of which are made moot by his removal the support he has is pretty ubiquitously “ well he is n’t trump ” luckily not being trump transfers to any other candidate the left might choose which biden ’s age and his israel response do not the right would only have 5 months to sow that level of doubt in another unknown candidate and there is very little chance of them being able to do so effectively the left will take anybody palatable at the point which will be hard to beat
one ’s is a dangerous conman liar but the other appeared as a walking corpse trump won the debate because he ’s the only one of the two that looks like he ’ll be alive for the next 5 years any democrat who now thinks biden will win is delusional what a mess they need a new candidate asap which they wo n’t do now we get to see fascism rise in america partly because of the ego of an old man who wo n’t step aside
i mean how about better choices that ’s the best both parties can come up with a pathological liar and a demented old man no one wants to be that guy or gal that takes responsibility anymore they just wanna go to washington and make bank so of course all the talented people go into finance or just stay in the background pulling the strings
it 's disgusting how quickly the mainstream media cnn and the new york times turned on biden calling for him to resign without giving him the chance to course correct x200b is it so unreasonable to believe that anyone including biden can have a bad day x200b not to mention trump who is a convicted felon and rapist not much younger than biden lied through his teeth throughout the debate and left such gems for us like they 're taking black jobs now and it could be 18 it could be 19 and even 20 million people “ when putin saw that he said you know what i think we ’re gon na go in and maybe take my ’ this was his dream i talked to him about it his dream ” the mainstream media is filled with cravens and cowardly backstabbers
welcome to 10 years ago
the orange comet is holding the door open for the american taliban
nixon lost a debate because he sweats too much only the most diehard partisan thinks either one won that debate the other day america lost but no one won
well it ’s country that elect the guy with less votes
maybe media people like yourselves should fact check the liar in real time
there was no winner just two losers
the psa guys made a great point that there is zero reason now for trump to show up for the next debate but and i realize that it wo n’t have nearly the same number of eyes on it but at least if trump no shows the next debate biden can just have all the time to himself and show that he is n’t the utter failure that we all saw on thursday
personally i do n't even think either side won it looked bad for both
honestly speaking it just infuriates me that anyone watching that could even declare either side a ' winner ' that was an absolute disaster for both sides and an embarrassment for the country as a whole
cnn said they were not going to be any fact checking there is no left leaning msm everyone knew trump was going to be full of lies biden was n't prepared able to push back as much as he should so of course it 's the public 's fault
you do n't win the debate by telling the truth you win the debate by being the most convinced that biden 's performance resonated so badly with democrats whereas trump 's did n't with republicans is what makes trump the winner
i think there 's a fundamental misunderstanding of how debates work if people are acting shocked that everyone thinks the liar won the debate it 's not about truths or lies it 's about performance biden was feeble and tired and could n't convey his own ideas he said he beat medicare for fuck 's sake much less call trump out on his lies in any effective manner biden had one foot in the grave up there and he made trump look mentally fit in comparison and now even morning joe the biggest biden ball washer in media says biden should step aside because he does n't think he 's capable of campaigning so biden lost and lost hard
the media is shit in the us even the supposedly good quality ones like the new york times pbs is the only semi good one and even it falls into the category of if it bleeds it leads or in this case the two can even be compared lying felon or a solid president having an off day for whatever reason i generally do n’t wax poetic for the past but at least in the days of walter cronkite they were at least attempting to be neutral i ’m sure they were n’t neutral but at least it was a goal
it feels like debates were useful when polarization was less old debates usually bantered about the finer points of issues not the winner take all mentality of today it ’s all become a ratings boon reality show i ’m not picking a person at this point but voting for an ideology that looks to the future and not the 1800s
yes because the other guy could n’t finish a thought
the problem is that most people are taking their cues from either fox news on the one side or jon stewart on the other side neither of these are interested in proper analysis
after thursday night it 's clear that biden would lose a debate to a bowl of tapioca pudding having him speak off script is just giving him rope to hang himself at this point trump does n't even need to be on stage for biden to show the country that the emperor has no clothes
the only way to pick a debate winner is by who benefited the most and it is quite clear that trump did the fact that he is a liar does n't hurt him it is already 100 % baked into his numbers trump lying spewing constant racism making no sense at all none of this things matter to his supporters you can look at him and wonder why anyone would support such a complete idiot but you have to accept that they will
really the stranger thing is that we live in a country where commentators and the media think that is a debate do schools not teach what debates are anymore
so trump admits in the debate that he knew russia would invade ukraine before it happened but all the msm can talk about is how old biden looks man we are so fucked
trump is a habitual liar when he says people are saying it means i 'm making shit up if you assume everything he says is a lie you would be correct 99 9 % of the time
i mean the debates are n't tests of their policy stances they are tests of their communication skills specifically that 's why trump won he demonstrated better overall communication skills and mental capacity even if it was his usual inane rambling fundamentally we have enough video of trump to know he 's been like this since the 1990s which means trump is for better or worse still in the same mental capacity as when he was in his 50s or at least that 's the image he 's projecting meanwhile biden looks like he 's gone very far down in cognitive decline
trump may have been lying and menacing but he was doing it so energetically
yes welcome to real life
we live in a country that thinks these debates are actual debates and where this debate means nothing these farces do nothing it should be here is x issue and how i plan to fix it then the other goes well that 's not a good plan because y and you fix that by doing z then you decide who you like better based on that this is just a televised smol pp contest
calling this reality tv show a debate thanks american educational system
this is the most important election of our lifetime with democracy itself on the ballot and we are doubling down on a candidate that barely could get his point across 50 % of the time with the other 50 % being he could n’t at all either democracy really is n’t under threat or democrats really do n’t care that much about democracy either
the sc overturned chevron deference yesterday
trump uses exaggerated extravagant expression it is hyperbole to say “ i 'd give my whole fortune for a bowl of bean soup ” whereas it is a lie deliberately designed to deceive and defraud to say the covid vaccine is 94 % effective you will never convince a trump supporter that he or she should be more concerned about hyperbole than deliberately crafted deception
there is a reason i have n't celeberated 4th of july for years this country is going down the drain
you 'd think the people that watched the 2016 election unfold might realize that and by extension realize that just about anyone other than a sputtering robot about to keel over would be a better choice
you also have to consider some people that watched were n't going to be swayed either way i know someone that watched and admitted they 're voting for trump because they do n't trust career politicians and since trump is a businessman he 'll run america like a business for people like that there 's no helping them it 's like they 're intentionally ignorant to the last 8 years
i do n’t think trump won but i think it ’s very reasonable for someone to look at biden and say “ that guy should not be the most powerful man in the universe ” democrats should truly stop trying to hedge their bets american people voting against trump if they do n’t inspire a big turnout and biden is not inspirational he is depressing then we will get trump project 2025 and this country will never recover anyone protecting biden at this point has blood on their hands
thankfully the debate does n't seem to have helped trump as much as feared sure trump conservatives loved it but it seems like most everyone else while not happy with joe did not care one bit for the absolute firehose of bullshit and lies that came from trump thursday especially trying to rewrite history
i still think biden won as he answered the debate questions and brought up actual talking points as opposed to veering off topic with bullshit lies but because he looked and sounded like the weary 82 year old man that he is the commentators think that guarantees a debate loss
biden stammered and had word finding issues but everything he said made sense trump was actually more polite than i expected but he said a lot of utter nonsense and he said terrible things about things like a reprint election results and spending on ukraine when he was clear i ’m deeply ashamed of democrats for not having biden ’s back and pointing out that he won this debate
we ’re still making excuses for an old 81 years man who has no business running for the presidency what fucking choice we have here an old lying cheating criminal vs an old lost in the middle of a sentence guy is hi both probably needed a diaper change at 10 pm that day what a fucking disaster
this was always gon na happen no one expects anything from the felon melon so he can shit his pants and it 's a footnote people demand perfection from biden so even if he was on his a game but stuttered once we 'd see stuff like this
the spin machine is wild i am glad most of you are not taking the bait biden needs to be replaced
we live in a country where the media will make more money if they can keep the orange buffoon in the news and make it a close race this is all about profit for the media yay capitalism s
everybody lies some more some less not everyone is in early stage alzheimers trump is terrible terrible choice for president but if you force people to choose between him and someone who should benin a care home you know what the outcome will be shame on anyone propiing biden at the moment you are complicit
this is the part that blows me away it was n't a debate debate is when two people argue over an exchange of facts truths and ideals trump lied every time he opened his mouth at no point did he make contact with reality there 's no debating with falsehood biden came off as a tired old man who ca n't go fast anymore but he was sincere he was addressing reality trump just stands there and makes shit up no wonder he could be confident he did n't have to worry about anything he said making any sense whatsoever he could say what ever he wanted that he thought served his best interests which is what he 'll do if he ever touches government again whatever he wants that serves his best interests mark my words the country does n't survive another trump presidency the supreme court is doing its level best right now to erase the rule of law but you put trump back in there and it 's absolutely over welcome to the united corporations of america
i ’m potentially wearing a tin foil hat but i ’m convinced that the wall of news headlines and commenters saying “ dems in panic from biden ’s utter loss to trump at debate ” is an attempted self fulfilling deal news is business and seeks out clicks through fear and panic if people actually listened to the question and answers or lack there of i feel like it ’s easy to see who “ won ” the debate if this was a college or highschool competitive debate team biden would have won trump ’s attempts at straight up gaslighting the nation were absolutely fucking insane and the fact that no one seems to care is terrifying “ the charlottesville rally never happened ” “ i never had sex with that porn star ” “ it was pelosi ’s fault the nat guard never showed up ” “ you called black people super predators in the 90 ’s ” “ i never called pows mia kia losers ” i ’m supposed to believe that all the dems and undecided are thinking about going third party write in not showing up because biden was showing his age do i love biden do i think biden is the best person in the world for the job no and no but jeeze he was actually answering the questions being asked he was n’t spewing out right lies and i trust his administration way more than the other guy ’s insanity “ panic ” if the dems are panicking then they need to take a step back take a deep breath and unplug from social media shit i think we ’d all be better off unplugging from social media
style over substance lies over values we ’re in the shallowest timeline
the constant lies and dodges help me understand why he chose not to testify in his own defense at trial if the judge would have held him accountable for lies directed him to answer the question when he weakly tried to dodge
one is a liar but he 's still energetic people seem to forget that the delivery is as important as the message itself in politics and all voters will remember from thursday night is the complete incoherence of some of biden 's statements i beat medicare
even if you say trump won he lied the entire time if biden debated just c level we would be like who trump is the worse person to debate and lied about everything
and it was the moderator 's job jake and dana but especially jake to interrupt trump as soon as he started responding with lies to what biden previously said to answer the question
the most cogent point o'donnell made last night is that nobody else is going to step in and run a 2 month campaign with no money complaining about the debate and the media and the electorate is futile
the problem was even if biden was on point with what he said being unintelligible is a hard sale people look at the guy and say fuck he is going to croak any minute and then they look at the who the vp is harris is widely unpopular especially among undecided voters she has very aggressively gone after weed users in the recent past as a prosecutor so that does n't help her with he young vote the problem with harris is she alienates undiced and the swing voters her strength is that for the most part she solidifies the biden base i 'm not so sure how she is on black voters as i only have antidotal knowledge of that
anyone who thinks biden lost is delusional trump could n’t communicate a clear truth the entire time
hey lawrence nobody cares that trump lies he ’s been doing it his entire life the last decade of his political career has been nothing but lies it does not matter
people need to watch this movie it illustrates exactly what s going on with trump my favorite line is americas endless appeals system
also many america and americans are wholly concerned with how things appear not how they actually are i see it all the time with my conservative friends from the army if you tell them they ’re special because they joined the military and thank them for their service they ’ll literally defend you taking away their military benefits most americans do n’t care about actually having the best most free country they want to wave a flag and chant for their football team country
my favorite meta joke with thank you for smoking is that there is no time in the movie where you actually see anyone smoking people are about to are interrupted the hold cigarettes but they never actually smoke them
i might ’ve been like 85 mg into my thc gummies already but i lost it when he started on about the dems aborting babies after 9 months and after birth makes no sense who that lie is for
same not american i saw 2 old men rambling one broken because the lies the other kept spitting one knows how to run a country and the other needs to go back to daycare one actually wants to improve american lives the other just wants power and does n’t care if he destroys his country in the process the thing that blows my mind is that americans allow criminals to run for presidency trump has a history of breaking laws being a grifter working with the mob etc
yeah but trump was r confidentlyincorrect
biden did poorly at the debate but trump flat out lied through it so the choice is between two old men with one being a liar i will vote for biden because i will not vote for a blatant liar
do n't forget about getting those black jobs still looking those up on linkedin but ca n't find any
you 're not wrong but reality is everyone expected trump to act even worse much worse actually that 's why biden 's camp set up the debate it was supposed to be biden 's moment to shine trump did n't surprise anyone with his lies and in fact delivered lots of chances for biden to attack correct him it was objectively a massive failure in the us you just do n't win people outside of retirement homes over with that kind of energy
it ’s insane to me that trump can spout lie after lie and no one calls him out on it biden was about as much use as a fart in a hurricane and the moderator was completely invisible the “ putin ’s dream ” and “ killing babies 9 months and later ” segments should have been front page with in depth analysis but it ’s all been “ joe is old ” unreal
trump always gets a neck pussy pass even back with hillary he “ won ” the debate to a lot of people any other person acting that way would have been considered a lunatic not a debate winner
republicans just win by default here if biden fucks up either by stumbling forgetting the question getting off track then he 's too old and demented meanwhile trump can rant for 2 minutes without even answering the question but somehow because he 's energetic that mean 's he 's mentally all there imagine if biden went on a 2 minute rant off topic the right would instantly say he 's lost his mind and does n't even remember the question trump literally talked about the borders every single question and then called biden worst president ever to end the question it 's like he had that one paragraph rehearsed and that was it but he 's more fit because he talked louder and more fluently
i do n't find it to be funny at all
the narrative that biden had a worse debate than trump is completely fabricated biden lacked energy but not ideas trump was barely coherent
and the trump immigrants line is so weak the people he ’s scaring us about literally do the jobs americans do n’t want to do they ’re absolutely vital in the farming and construction industries but to hear trump tell it they ’re just here to rape babies and collect welfare
biden was n't on his a game he fumbled a bit ca nt we all just be honest biden was horrible by any pre trump standards which is i think the point most people are making when naming trump the winner reasonable people understand the issues with trump we know he is the worse candidate we also know that to that group of under 500k people in like 4 states that are going to swing the election this was a net biden loss
i 'm not american either but i will be honest people do n't care about decent ideas they want to look at how well they keep their shit in the debate and biden did horrible i was thinking he shat himself on the spot everytime he was talking def not a good look in avarage people views
the purpose of the debate was to compare the candidates ' vigor and physical strength trump won because he appeared put together healthy and cognizant biden did n't merely fumbled a bit but blew his entire charade he looked lost his words were a mishmash of gibberish and jill had to help him walk off the stage biden should had not run for reelection
biden did n't fumble a bit he failed to complete sentences rarely said anything coherent and could n't defend easy positions this was an unmitigated disaster and it proved that biden actually is too old for the oval office
but if you ask the dumbasses on reddit that means biden will lose
fumbled a bit come the hell on lol
trump could n’t complete a single coherent argument he would stop mid sentence pivot to another topic stop and just spit hate and do fear mongering how the fuck is america okay with this if i was an american i ’d vote for a brick and not trump
i was just listening to the debate not watching it without the visual references my takeaway was that as expected trump can not actually use critical thinking and respond to a question his only verbal ability is weird stream of consciousness rambles on the same tired old whines biden on the other hand while sounding somewhat lethargic was able to address the questions propose actual policy to respond to them and express empathy for the struggles americans are facing
there 's not a single person in this subreddit who 's voting for trump no matter who he runs against it could have been a dead rat standing in that debate against him and people would still defend the rat honestly it would have been more coherent than trump to say the least there are two issues here 1 people in this subreddit are not the ones who are going to decide this ellection for those who do n't know yet on who they 'll vote or more importantly if they will bother to vote at all the debate did n't help biden 2 anyone thing is better than trump but is biden really the best the democrats could get should we be in the situation of watching a poor candidate going against whatever trump is
trump looks like a crazy old rambling man but my god are you all really downplaying how demonstrably bad biden looked up there he looked like the cryptkeeper like you could see through his paper skin with a pen light an absolute skeleton that could barely form a coherent sentence is n’t one of his great personal achievements he rants on about how he was able to overcome his stutter he needs to rehire his coach from grade school because that was a mess the only thing he could have done to be better on that stage is to die and pass the reigns onto someone that looks like they might make it to the end of the week let alone the end of a 4 year presidency
was n't on his a game is not how the debate should be described decent ideas like what mumbling amd talking shit fumbled a bit the dude was walked over by trump trump was funny biden was shocking is this it then is this how the dems are dressing this they 're really gon na keep pushing for the obviously inept mumbling confused old and tired man to run against trump well he 'll lose fuck me he 'll lose
then just vote for the old 621311
that 's not true trump addressed most of the questions usually by saying when i was presidenti fixed that issue under biden its been the worst ever then rambling on about immigrants
best they have to offer
the president will be decided by a few thousand white men in suburban rural pennsylvania trump spoke to them biden scared them your opinion as a non american is fine but does n't matter to this conversation
a bit he ’s half brain dead
i saw an unemployed felon who 's awaiting sentencing rambling on about killing babies burning cities and a swarm of murder migrants the other guy was just old with a cold but was coherent considering he was addressing the questions he was actually being asked for some reason everyone online wants me to be deeply concerned about the guy who was n't a raving lunatic weird
good thing you are n’t american so it does n’t matter what you saw
the people who needed to be honest lied it was about biden proving he was fit to run and dispel the projection we were barraged day in and day out with a lie that he was now we have a meme running with every senior moment that are coming thick and fast thrown into the fray biden was n't on his a game biden was a disaster he looked like a walking corpse no amount of spin could change what we saw with our eyes and ears you need a president with his faculties still intact and no amount of oh he had a cold or was n't on his a game will pass
biden was n’t just not on his a game he looked and acted like he could completely lose his faculty or drop dead any day i do n’t for a second believe he could make it another 4 years and would n’t be surprised if he does n’t make it to the election i think he did an amazing job as president but i think he needs to hand the reigns to someone else and remain as an adviser to help a transition
there have been multiple statements from democrats in recent weeks that biden is declining rapidly the debate reinforced this it wo n’t change decided voters but it will certainly hurt with undecideds “ we ’d be able to right wipe out his debt we ’d be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do childcare elder care making sure that we continue to strengthen our health care system making sure that we ’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what i ’ve been able to do with the with with with the covid excuse me with dealing with everything we have to do with look if we finally beat medicare ”
397 bold faced lies and that was just in the last 60 seconds
but he lies so presidentially s
ehh it was a bad performance and bad debates happen the other guy still did n’t answer a single question and lied all night as shaky as biden was i ’m still voting for him why because i ’m voting blue while the president is an important position the team he builds is just as important and i ’d rather have that than trump and his lackeys
throughout the leadup to the debate commentators made it clear that the expectations for biden had almost nothing to do with substance and everything to do with appearing healthy and capable enough to finish what is sure to be an absolutely awful campaign and the next four years and that 's exactly where he failed
trump did n’t win biden lost all these comments from people about biden delivering on the substance are missing the damn point independents and new voters notoriously vote based on appearances and biden had the charisma of a corpse great he gives a good speech the next morning but ca n’t deliver when it matters they ’re going to play the debate clips non stop between now and the election i think sticking with biden ’s ghost is a mistake i ’ll vote for him if that ’s what i ’m left with but goddamn it is ridiculous that we are being forced to vote for an declining 81 year old
yep we were very complacent in 2016 people were like hillary 's got this in the bag so i 'd rather we be in a panic right now then repeat 2016 and say every thing is fine biden 's got this
absolutely navigating political debates requires more than just age and experience
i completely agree with you if they were going to fuck up now was the time to do it everyone was crowning biden ’s ass weeks before this debate i feel the campaign got cocky and complacent this was the wake up call needed
biden is beyond getting on in years he is legit elderly it is an irrefutable fact which he made exponentially worse on thursday it does n’t matter if you or i think he still has the mental faculties to lead the nation because the majority of the sovereign thinks the opposite and it is the ultimate weapon being used with effect by the opposition this is n’t just some other election it can literally result in the end of times for our democratic republic as we know it biden can either take the road of cincinnatus put down the laurel wreath go back to his farm and be admired by the ages for doing so or cling to power out of pride and hubris and bring evil to the nation he loves i like biden i think he ’s been a great president but he ’s not going to win after thursday he has to go and go fast before it ’s too late
but why are people ignoring the fact that he did deliver the next day everyone gets sicks including the president my brain does n’t want to work when i ’m sick and that goes for lots of young brilliant folk the brain needs a reboot and is lagging
why are people relying on a debate look at the man ’s presidency i wish americans would stop looking at talk talk is cheap show me this or any persons actions and results that ’s all i need i do n’t care if he was in a coma and declaring policies through a psychic interpreter the man ’s actions and results are great for that alone he gets my votes
you waste a lot of time countering the lies meanwhile the liar just keeps on getting more lies out there and the whole thing is on their terms
did we watch the same debate pretty much every trump lie was countered with biden saying “ the very idea of that being possible is bonkers and here is why ”
no this is ' murican style ' baitin ' it 's a contest of strength and vigor
yeah debates are n’t about truth they ’re about showmanship they allow us to see who is more likable and who is more effective at selling their agenda biden failed while trump succeeded it does n’t matter that he lied he always lies what mattered is trump still has charisma and vigor while biden could n’t convince us 81 is n’t too old to be in office it was a shit show
there also was a time aspect biden needed to answer and correct trump numerous lies in 1 2min no wonder he was overwhelmed
what is a compus mentis
and why is he acting like 50 million people watching is no big deal lmao just a few hundred thousand people in a swing state can decide the election
hydrogen hydroxide is a very dangerous chemical inhaling it can cause death
are you kidding did you watch the debate biden is fucking cooked he lost because it seemed like he was on hospice care not fucking nyt opinions be serious
the liberal oriented pundits did n't need to spin it other than a disaster but they also did n't need to overreact because biden 's not going to step aside and there is n't anybody else except harris who 'd be willing to do it anyway did they think 2 seconds about that no now having panicked all these assholes calling for biden to step away will have to stick to their guns the whole way which will depress turnout the debate performance was recoverable otherwise biden could win and then resign in 6 months or a year or whatever
no i 'm sure denying reality and pretending like this old man with age related brain function issues is fine is a ticket to winning after screaming for 8 years about how maga chuds do n't inhabit reality it 's wild to see liberals look at something that is plainly obvious and call it fake news and just flat out deny reality i do n't know how anyone can claim biden does n't have dementia or cognitive impairment or whatever and have the ability to look at themselves in the mirror how do you lie and deny reality that hard and maintain any respect for yourself it 's so soul crushingly pathetic that i feel embarrassment to the level of physical discomfort when i think about watching that debate and then saying he just had an off night or it was just a bad debate and not immediately demand the dnc stop abusing that elderly man in the single highest profile most visible example of elder abuse in human history dawg come back to reality
especially after saying watch me back in february such an own goal why the hell did his team push for it they 're the ones who asked for a june debate not trump
has a debate ever went so badly your own party has serious discussions about replacing you there s no way to spin it biden lost
he did n’t really fuck up he is just physically and mental fucked up which is a natural process of age the dnc is responsible for keeping the lie up that he was fit for office for so long
welcome to every debate since the beginning of time oratory and debate skills have a strong element of theatrics you have to convince people you are correct facts help but so do presentation skills
i mean it 's a reflection of america corporatism and a reflection of its most sought after values lying swindling smooth talking showmanship and a complete lack of accountability what goes in one ear on tuesday was never said by friday
that ’s how debate works though good debaters lie effectively and better debaters know how to dog walk someone who lies when trump said he never slept with a porn star biden could have easily hammered him on that if he was n’t ancient biden just straight up lost and we have the dnc to blame for where we are now
true but biden benefitted from it in the primaries in 2020
and televised debate has always been that way just look at the debate between nixon and jfk nixon looked terrible on tv and jfk looked presidential nixon probably had the better answers that night but that is n't what people focused on and as a result nixon was crushed in the general election
his rally was in the morning and the debate was at 9 pm biden was sundowning
this is the problem voters were already apathetic toward biden and i fear the debate will only make it worse add in independents and undecided voters and i think dems are in for a rude awakening on election day if the ticket stands as is
it ’s scary though because now everyone is saying “ well i ’m voting for biden ’s cabinet ” as the most reasonable argument that should terrify everybody if the best case you can make for why you should vote for someone is the because their staff will be better than the other guys staff
almost every political debate veers off topic to the candidates talking points biden turning abortion rights into immigration was an unforced error
polls are already coming out saying biden extended his lead on trump after the debate you ’re not even a us citizen i do n’t know what your problem is
no one is denying the truth how about we give the poor guy a chance to prove himself rather than just throw away the man who won against trump in 2020 like a used napkin
hearing that is the same as hearing maga say they 'll still vote for trump with his felonies very cult like actions
100 % and that 's the problem
some of the swing states ca n’t replace him on the ballot unless he dies because deadlines have passed i know people could write in the new candidate but that would be a disaster
now this is a defeatist take if i ever heard one in most election cycles i would agree with you but let ’s stop acting like a traitorous compromised malignant narcissist who wants to implement fascism in america is a normal candidate there is significant distaste for trump all over the country and many people are going to vote against him no matter how underwhelming his opponent is with that said i do wish that biden would step aside and put his support behind someone younger but let ’s not resign to the fact that biden can still win this election
those papers reflected the views of millions of democrats across the country this is not a media conspiracy but biden had a terrible performance that made him seem senile
the whole point of a debate is to sway voters to your side did he succeed as much as it pains me to say he lost for that reason alone
it ’s delusional to not accept the reality of what happened and it ’s honestly disrespectful to our country to believe that biden is mentally fit for the job so many times last night he left trump off the hook we all lost last night after watching that joke of a debate biden did his job he had his four years now he needs to let someone else come in a beat trump do n’t want to hear any fear mongering bs about him being the only one who could do it because it ’s not true
maybe when everybody is saying democracy is literally on the line we do n’t take a “ wait and see ” attitude with someone far too fucking old to be there in the first place
yeah man let ’s all pretend that biden is not mentally impaired and that he will not get crushed in november people saw biden ’s cognitive decline and you ca n’t change no matter how many times the people on this sub say they will still vote biden
there 's a difference between having a bad day and not knowing what day it actually is
well he definitely had a bad day he even struggled with um you know damn the you know we did some things with that covid no not that umm it ’s not a big deal oh um zzzz zzzzz zzz excuse me you know i did all these things with that one thing uhhhhhhhhhhhh we beat medicare
the mainstream media is filled with cravens and cowardly backstabbers in other words perfect match for the donald no wonder he plays them every time like a fiddle they dance to his whims i like trump 's new tone was a thing for a while might be cruel words but the tone even he laughed it up i bet
those media outlets are right dnc needs to wake up and realize they ca n’t win with biden
wtf are you talking about lmao for months not w everyone is saying biden is n’t all there and is falling apart quickly it just finally was on display for the whole country to see during the debate it ’s fucking garbage the dems think they can run an old man with dementia and we will all fall in line to vote it ’s pathetic and as a life long democrat i could not be more disappointed with this biden is going to get absolute crushed by trump in nov and it will be a master class on how not to run a campaign
i really hope you ’re ready for another trump presidency sticking with a shitty candidate is what got us trump in 2016
it was n't a bad day a bad performance is excusable but his performance was abysmal especially when his age and cognitive abilities have been questioned since his term started it 's also not the job of the mainstream media to back up a candidate
so nobody won you know that the press could say that it is a viable answer
do n’t forget the third trimester is between the women and the state
it 's the longest he 's been in front of a camera without a teleprompter in years nobody expected perfection but after hearing non stop that biden is as sharp as a tack and leading the country with competence and decisiveness behind closed doors just to be met with this is very different the dnc and democratic leadership lied to our faces
big difference between what we saw and perfection though is n't there look at a debate from 2008 or 2012 that 's what i expect from presidential candidates compare it to the two old men we saw thursday night and tell me that 's acceptable
i did n't demand perfection i did n't even demand good i expected him to clear the hurdle of not looking like the caricature of a senile old man that the gop had been pushing for weeks he could n't even meet that hurdle it 's a low bar on the opposite end of perfection
he did n't just stutter once though did you watch the debate if so did you not see his face did you not hear him struggling to put a coherent thought together and often failing he looked like he escaped the nursing home and we need to call a silver alert it was n't just bad it was an all time historically bad debate performance
that 's always been the way
debates are just as much about performance as they are about communicating the undecided are watching both and rightfully asking themselves who they 'd trust more with the nuclear codes
trump lost on substance but biden was the only one that took a bazooka to his own campaign
it ’s just a money making machine for lawyers with no commitment to justice whatsoever
what ’s interesting about that movie is that it was produced by david o sacks elon musk and peter thiel three people who absolutely love trump
the book is really good too
if right does n’t matter we ’re lost if the truth does n’t matter we ’re lost adam schiff nailed it nearly four years ago from alternative facts to fake news trump co have created a world where the truth does n't count therefore if biden was able to calmly pick apart trumps lies it would n't have mattered for many the folks in maga world do n't actually listen for the truth when trump predictably picked up the firehose of falsehoods it was the appearance of both candidates that most folks took away trump looked confident and biden appeared lost like most dictatorships maga world is attracted to trump 's larger than life character and not the content of his character
another way of looking at this or becoming aware of when you are being manipulated is checking for emotional reactivity ask yourself after reading a headline “ does this article want to make me feel anything ” almost everything trump says it to anger his enemies and pet his believers for example at some point people are just dopamine controlled by it appealing to emotions is one of the strongest of persuasion methods because few can resist it
camerota but what you ’re saying is but hold on mr speaker because you ’re saying liberals use these numbers they use this sort of magic math these are the fbi statistics they ’re not a liberal organization they ’re a crime fighting organization gingrich no but what i said is equally true people feel more threatened camerota feel it yes they feel it but the facts do n’t support it gingrich as a political candidate i ’ll go with how people feel and i ’ll let you go with the theoriticians republicans are n't even pretending to care about reality any more
if anyone wants more evidence that the gop assume their base are n't critical thinkers they keep asking the trope are you better off than 4 years ago when 4 years ago was the height of covid yes we are all better off than 4 years ago when the gop was telling everyone to eat horse paste and shove lights up their butt
there is a lot of point in saying this the maga cult is not the target audience for that point of analysis
this where you made a mistake gop has no issues they have no policy to fix anything they just posture and yell i 'm a gop registered voter who wo n't vote for any of them probably again
this is why trump did n’t even bother to prep he already knew he was just going spout bullshit all night and that his base would eat it up so why bother it was just another rally for him
inflation caused by trump 's tariffs the ability to borrow money at near zero percent interest for years is the real cause of inflation but nobody is willing to open that can of worms
and do n't forget people who support trump literally think everything he says is true
to them it ’s just the loudest candidate 100 % the conspiracy sub before the debate was complaining about being blindsided by the debate rules they were mad that trump would n't be able to interrupt to them that is a real debate they had to be told over and over that that 's not how debates work on any level
they still ca n’t name anything trump did in his term he created the very best ecomony the world has ever seen because he 's such a smart businessman he solved border he had no wars none the 200 000 bombs trump dropped were what we call prophylactic bombs he cured abortion he personally saved billions of people with his vaccines that unfortunately have the side effect of killing them too he solved the middle east he made america safe for christians again he made america great again that 's the list and it is not to be questioned repeat it 1000x day if necessary
it 's been around for a long time fifteen years ago when i was still playing piano for this catholic church they used to send around emails about how doctors are allowed to kill healthy newborns by stabbing them in the neck with scissors if the parents decided they did n't want the baby anymore silly
what 's so frustrating about biden fumbling that is all anyone has to ask is do you know anyone that carried a pregnancy to 9 months and said screw it i do n't want to have a baby so then the doctor said okee dokee and they just murdered the baby it 's so obscene and there is no logic to it but the gop insist it 's a thing the only reason an abortion would happen in the 9th month is because something tragic happened and the gop are treating it a folly
makes no sense who that lie is for agreed it is a stupid lie a good liar will lie about something that is less trivially refutable it is such a bizarre thing to say
a fascist calling his “ enemies ” baby killers to rile up their supporters is sadly par for the course
they were using that lie all that way back during gore bush
and biden did n’t even shut him down for that bullshit nonsense what the fuck man
the thing that blows my mind is that americans allow criminals to run for presidency i 'm guessing that the founder had a couple of reason not to restrict criminals 1 the electoral college was put in place to weed undesirable people out politicians have perverted its purpose over the years and it no longer serves as a check 2 if we disallowed criminals from running all an incumbent would need to do to get rid of their opponent would be to have them convicted of a crime it could lead to an undesirable class where laws are crafted specifically to make them ineligible to challenge the ruling class
the thing that blows my mind is that americans allow criminals to run for presidency it blows many many american minds too
and when your base is a bunch of fucking idiots being confident and loud is all you need because they wo n't comprehend what he said or fact check anything if they do
same i ’ll vote for biden as a vote against trump he ’s proven to be a very dangerous man
i do n’t think biden or anyone else thought trump would be pushover trump crushes it at debates i mean not if you care about the truth or intelligent policy but just like the dog and pony aspect his gish gallop of insane lies and nonsense plus insults is tough to beat it ’s just that biden did not have much of a choice if he dodges the debate it ’s because he ’s too senile to debate the only way to show his mental acuity to the satisfaction of those who care about debates is to debate trump and win or at least shoe some level of desired energy regardless of the odds that ’s the thing about people suggesting whitmer or whoever they do n’t want to debate trump either it ’s just free airtime for him and makes it look like he should be treated as a normal serious policy maker instead his mere presence on the stage gives him an unearned gravitas the reality is that trump is hard to beat his hardcore supporters want nothing more than for him to show up in court or on national tv or at serious campaign events where he can “ put the system on trial ” by behaving how he wants and not how he is supposed to trying to debate trump is trying to defeat him in a game that he is n’t playing just like how trump could actually have won his legal cases if he did n’t have the most clownishly lawyers put up the stupidest legal defenses ever he ’s not trying to win those case he ’s trying to win a pr battle it ’s hard for me to imagine there is a candidate out there who prefers trying to win a three month campaign out of scratch against a wildly popular republican which would require them to engage with trump as much as possible including another debate
i am old enough to remember that every sitting president has a bad first debate they 're busy and a bit rusty at it obama 's first reelection debate was bad so was trump 's and bush 's
i honestly thought trump went easy on him that was smart trump knows his demeanor hurts him a lot he is intentionally acting less crazy trump could have really torn biden to shreds over his mental state but did n't i am honestly annoyed by it trump used to be really good at making himself look bad
i did n’t watch the debate accessibility issues but my jaw dropped at these two comments when i was watching the ap fact checking going on live like admitting to cozying up with our enemy to such a degree he ’s talking about “ dreams ” to invade other countries should ’ve made it over for him i mean i knew it would n’t because the time he made fun of a disabled person in 2016 should ’ve been that moment too and it was n’t but the lack of media attention to it is astonishing
here ’s the sad reality of the situation trump should n’t even need to be called out because it ’s so bat shit insane it should be evident to the majority the fact trump is n’t immediately disqualified as a candidate due to an informed public speaks to how stupid and selfish our current society is and there is no easy solution for that
but somehow because he 's energetic i remember trump sleeping through his trial he ai n't energetic
trump was barely coherent did we watch the same debate the one were biden declared he beat medicare the one where when asked about abortion he pivoted to talk about immigrant murders that debate do n't get me wrong i 'll be voting against trump on election day but to say that biden was anywhere in the realm of coherent for half the debate is preposterous
yep we also have to consider that ultimately the groups that are being targeted are different elections are a turnout game sure there are a small number of swingable people but what really matters is turning out the people who are likely to pull for you if you can get them to the election site the type of people who would consider voting for trump do n't care about the same stuff that the type of people who would vote for biden would the type of people who would vote for biden care more about their candidate looking coherent trump voters have shown us that the bar is so low that looking like a deranged madman does n't hurt him with them so yeah the debate was a loss for biden because he hurt himself with his prospective voters and trump did not
i feel like i ’m taking crazy pills people are trying to convince us he did n’t sound like he is headed for hospice and it is driving me nuts he needs to drop out now he will lose and we will have fascism people telling us to ignore what we watched just is making fascism more likely not less
america is a nation full of 12 year olds instead of listening to and reading the actual policies of the candidates and fact checking them they instead listen to whoever talks or screams louder even if everything he said was full of lies and bigotry
trump literally did shit himself during the debate there 's a recording of it
the purpose of the debate was to compare the candidates ' vigor and physical strength ' murican style ' batin '
did you read the transcript his responses made total sense his projection was weak and he had a stutter the problem was that he was trying to debate total lies with facts
dang i did n’t know there were two kinds i think trump does them both simultaneously
bad performance wtf are you talking about he look like he was about to die half the time he could not put 2 sentences together i guess he did beat medicare or whatever he was trying to say he is the president that should be ready to act at any moment in the interest of the us citizen remember the phone call at 2 am that clinton had talked about i do nt think biden would know where he was if he got a call at 2 am insane situation we have
actually bad debates like this do n't happen it was unprecedented historically bad
you are still voting for him but what about any of the other 50 plus million that saw it live or many millions more that just saw the clips after stop being delusional about the nature of politics and elections it is only getting trump elected again biden must step aside or the sake of the country
bad debates happen this is burying your head in the sand biden is already losing this race and he confirmed everyone ’s worst fears on thursday night of course biden is still preferable to trump for us but he ’s now straight on track to lose everyone here needs to understand how much of a disaster it was and realize that he needs to be replaced biden can not win and trump cannot be allowed to win
the debate does n’t matter for people who “ vote blue no matter who ” it ’s about the independents and undecided voters seeing that bidens fucked lol
everybody that says the phrase ' because i 'm voting blue ' would vote for a fire extinguisher over trump the debate was n't for you it was for the 55 year old wisconsinite suburban husband who is worried about projecting international strength it was for the sizeable muslim population centers in swing state michigan that is why biden lost the debate those people absolutely did not leave with more faith in biden after his performance than before
it was n't just a bad debate bad debates do happen bad debates are fine biden was just bumbling and could n't form a coherent sentence that 's not a bad debate dude was straight up sundowning on stage we need to replace him asap a good candidate will easily kick trump 's ass in november we will lose because of biden
tik tok and social media were already flooded with clips of biden frequent gaffes and senior moments after this debate it 's going to be a bloodbath the delusional people on this sub have no idea how embarrassingly bad biden is going to lose
this is exactly it i ’m so frustrated with the spin because yes biden is n’t a lying sack of shit congrats to him oh wow i did n’t see that coming s but i watched america ’s best shot at stopping a dictator either absolutely shit the bed or drop the ball on every single question “ he ’s got a cold ” great our president becomes incoherent because of the common cold “ lowest viewer turnout for any first debate in the 21st century ” okay that changes nothing “ he told the truth and had the most substance ” that was never in question is a mighty low bar and ignores the fact that his one job was to dispel the “ biden ’s old ” shit and all he did was reinforce it “ he did fine at his rally the next day ” i do n’t give a shit the common man does n’t give a shit dems want to see him bulldoze trump and instead he struggled to even make coherent arguments about abortion i watched the state of the union and was excited here he was energetic and giving it to people straight and shooting down republican bullshit all in one go that man was not there that night replacing the nominee is suicide see lbj leaving his vp out to dry by dropping out and something only biden can do thanks dnc for removing superdelegates it was always a shit idea and now our chickens are coming home to roost we made our bed and now we have to lie in it i only hope the next debates if trump is dumb enough to have another one can turn things around because we had a rough start
you think this is better than if biden had done a good job and we were n't in a panic completely nuts biden was already behind in the polls it was n't comparable to hillary 's situation at all people were already worried being down in the polls and having your candidate look like he has dementia is not an advantage people like to vote for a winner the kind of people who do n't regularly vote are n't going to be inspired to do so by what 's happening
wake up call to do what what do you think the campaign can do now that it was n't doing for the idea the idea that they were cocky and complacent is completely untrue they 're down in the polls and they absolutely know they have to do everything they can it should be pretty clear that the problem here is that biden ca n't do the kind of stuff that his campaign needs him to he can deliver an ok speech in front of a teleprompter and that 's about it
a home run the day after the game does n't count
because the audience the next day is a few hundred thousand “ vote blue no matter who ” democrats looking for something to make them feel better watching biden give a speech with a teleprompter the audience the day before was 51 million television viewers watching both candidates side by side plus the countless others who heard clips analysis and commentary online and elsewhere the big day was the debate not a rally in nc
because the next day did n’t matter the debate was broadcast everywhere for everyone and that was the prime chance to sway voters on the fence he completely blew that chance and it ’s entirely possible he wo n’t get another
because the next day he was just reading at the debate he had to think for himself it was n't a good look for him off script
“ why does it matter that he completely bombed in front of 50 million people he did great the next day in front of no one ” you got ta be pretty fucking dumb to make this argument
because nobody cares about the next day he failed when it mattered
because the cat is already out of the bag he already demonstrated he is incapable his performance was n’t because he had a cold it was senility of some kind it will only get worse
being sick does n't give someone resting 25th amendment face biden scared the shit out of me during the debate still voting for him if that is who the dems put up but i do n't think he is fit to be president at least i like his administration though and they can pull his strings for the next four years trump as we all know would be a disaster so obviously i ca n't vote for him
delivering a canned stump speech is not comparable to debating being able to quickly formulate responses to questions or remarks you could n't really prepare for takes alot of mental agility biden can no longer do that to be clear you do n't have to be a good debater to be a good president it 's a niche skillset but it 's seriously impressive when it 's done well clinton for example was great at it biden in previous years was ok he stumbled a bit but he was direct forceful and he always landed his message this debate proved biden is no longer capable of debating well it does n't mean he ca n't be president it does n't mean trump would be a better president as if nailing a speech from a teleprompter in front of your own loyal supporters is not an equivalent test
the question is whether biden is suffering from cognitive decline just because there are times where he looks good does n't mean he 's not suffering from it unfortunately biden 's best moments are happening behind a teleprompter and even when those are amazing people are n't going to easily forget this debate performance
the folks who follow politics know this but they already made up their minds long ago the folks who do n't may see these candidates speak a handful of times before november one bad night matters
he did just that yes called him a liar repeatedly after his bs by question 3 4 it was a pattern
people wanted biden to debate trump while also explaining how he was doing it all in 2 minutes he ca n’t sit there and explain to you why he ’s lying and the significance because he literally does n’t have the time there ’s too many lies so either biden answered moderators questions or rebutted the lies but he could n’t do both
maybe but i could n’t understand anything he was mumbling and he had the stage presence of a sponge
biden was mumbling and incoherent though
we did and the issue is biden 's why was usually mumbled incoherent and jumbled with non sequitors he needed to not only provide the correct perspective but incisively point out exactly how trump was lying i mean fuck trump threw out there putin told him it was his dream to invade ukraine and it just floated away a good debater would grab that point out the private meetings with putin and question his motivations on ukraine
i 'm familiar with biden policies so i know what he was trying to say mostly but he did n't actually say it if you are n't in the weeds of politics and already have the context and facts behind these issues you just saw a bumbling old man who could barely string a sentence together even with the context that 's what i saw
oh we watched the same debates do n't get me wrong i 'm glad biden did n't fumble through his rehersed zingers about having the morals of an alley cat or calling him a sucker and a loser it was him trying to disprove his lies by providing the truth that biden fell flat on his face claiming he beat medicade saying that the first ' time ' abortion is between a woman and her doctor a second ' time ' is between a woman the doctor and a medical emergency and the third time is between the woman the doctor and the state let 's not forget that trump claimed dems support post birth abortions to which biden said nothing
and still he fucking lost cause he mumbled and made no sense and when it went back to trump trump said i do n't understand what he said and i do n't think he does either so trump won the argument maybe on paper biden might come across better but what we saw on tv was a man unfit to run america that 's how bad the counter was he barely answered and it was mumbled and incoherent stop gaslighted us please it was shit
calling something malarkey is n't a good refutation it just made him seem old he rarely gave a convincing rebuttal because he struggled to recall facts and figures
being mentally all there for a lack of a better phrase it refers to someone is in control and responsible for their actions
i 'm horrified haha and i was n't comforted by his speech the next day seeing 2 completely different people is n't comforting i 'm simply saying both candidates are scary as shit
are n’t you concerned that this health status would n’t be known to the american people feels like something everyone should have transparency around for the biggest decision we could make
my conspiracy brain thinks maybe they want an open convention and pushing to have the debate early was so they could have some sort of out
no one of any actual importance on the dem side is having those discussions the news is spinning it to get clicks but there is zero chance anyone is actually considering replacing him this close to the election it would be legit election suicide
because the dnc would rather lose to trump than have a progressive win just like in 2016 with bernie and same thing now with anyone else
not debating full lies and falsehoods
what ’s funny is that it ’s not even like biden was going great before the debate he ’s way down in the polls and that ’s to a convicted felon named donald trump seriously it would t be a rude awakening it will be the most avoidable catastrophe we ’ve ever seen
biden needs a really popular vp so voters assume they 're actually voting for them as biden 's bout to croak
no president has ever won an election off the back of i 'm actually voting for the competency of their staff
i am telling myself that they practiced responding to all of the ways trump was going to lie or deflect about abortion rights and when trump basically said i did it and everyone loves it biden 's brain just completely sharted itself
more democratic voters than not want biden replaced after debate performance it 's easy to shit polls in your favor i can do it too
he did have a chance and he fucking blew it how many chances does he need to have for us to delude ourselves into thinking he ’s a good candidate he ’s had 3 5 years and most people still do n’t like him maybe it ’s him
“ poor guy ” wtf he ’s the fucking president this is n’t his first job out of college this election is way too important to fall back on this weak bullshit he needs to go immediately
this was his chance he blew it
how do n’t you understand that was biden ’s chance biden barely won against trump in 2020 and that was only because of covid democracy is on the ballot do n’t fuck around with our future
the beltway 's great options guarantee a second trump term in polls to boot let 's make the situation even worse is the advice great it was bad but biden 's still the only dem keeping trump in a real race at this point that 's the reality
everyone should vote to achieve the most ethical outcome in an election so obviously voting for the lesser evil is more ethical way to vote one is just as responsible for one 's inaction as the action one take if one believes both options are terrible all one can do is mitigating the damage mitigating the damage is the ethical vote
only a third of the voting public even saw the debates and swing voters are the kinds of people to not watch presidential debates this means that calling for biden to be replaced and drawing undue panic and hysteria to all of this is far more damaging to biden 's campaign than it might otherwise appear edit just saw more of the debate serious questions need to be asked by democrats and the media to his team not calls for resignation about what happened that night and biden needs to either somehow reassure people by giving more performances with the energy and vigour he showed at his campaign rally the morning after the debate that he 's ok or step down
it ’s amazing how much liberals seem to want to fail time and time again they get mad at people who want them to be better
agree but we are past that do you honestly think swapping out biden right now will help tough call shitty situation i have faith he will ramp up for the next round of debates in a few months if not we are screwed
who else should they vote for
yeah people are deluding themselves if they ca n't see that was an all time horrible debate performance it was n't obama stumbling against romney or nixon looking a bit sweaty it was a guy who was painted by trump as senile acting and sounding like he was on death 's door people can put their heads in the sand but biden is n't winning after that debate he just is n't the attack ads write themselves
money making machine for corporate attorneys the regular joe has zero dollars to hold corporations and wealthy elites accountable regular joe would bankrupt themselves by trying
so it was a blueprint for action a plan to embark upon
they support him in basically every situation but their support always seems wildly intellectually dishonest especially sacks who throws himself into every dishonest talking point trump is a means to an end for them i think so they play their parts to either build or yield power
all they care about is feelings
do n’t forget they were also telling us to inject bleach which a significant number of people did
do n't forget the gop told us we had to sacrifice grandma for the economy
4 years ago a huge portion of lower class americans were making an extra few hundred dollars a week to stay home a lot of americans were never in a better financial situation than they were at the height of the pandemic they had more in the bank then and that 's all that matters to them
not even that trump claimed we had the best covid experience in the world anybody who lived through it ought to know better but somehow people nod along at this horseshit
i 'd say it 's the tax cuts since taxes are the way you take money out of circulation
there is no virtue in a lie the end does n’t justify the means the “ pro life ” argument made with a grotesque misrepresentation of real life realities is obscene this is one of the reasons why the entire pro life argument on abortion collapses this particular lie is the one of the reasons i walked away from catholic church the families and doctors who have the awesome responsibility making these decisions need the support of the community not the righteous indignation of the “ anointed ones ” with or without merit a lie is a lie and nothing good will ever come from it the proof is before our very eyes donald trump pandering with that very lie
it ’s really fucking hard not to want to be a satanist when you see the actual levels of manipulation and lies the church spews there ’s way too much politics in religion and vice versa
i think the correct way to attack trump at a debate is to not bother trying to fact check every little thing and just talk about him generally like “ how stupid must donald think you are to brazenly lie to your face about stuff that ’s so easy to disprove ” just keep making it about his contempt for his supporters talk about how bannon was convicted for stealing from them and trump pardoned him for it
yeah trump lobbed so many soft balls that anyone a bit closer to their prime would have knocked out of the part my theory is that trump had an edge just by not being bound by reality biden had to remember facts and figures to counter him and it takes him time to find that knowledge
the dems just let them get away with the post birth abortion bit it 's like they do n't even care you almost never hear any push back about that it 's always the robotic we believe in a women 's right to choose because they refuse to get into the mud with the republicans
apparently elon musk dr did n't do the deed but
he has repeated it before clearly someone told him once this was happening and he ca nt believe its not
nothing is off limits when you 're part of the base that 's convinced schools are evil their extended attack on the education system is coming to a head and p2025 will privatize all schools if executed fully if you know a teacher who cares about children well they 're about to be replaced with a parishioner ok already unconstitutionally demands the bible be taught in schools louisiana mandates the 10 commandments be visible on a poser sized page we are falling off the right edge with the most progressive president in decades in office vote
if only there were someone on stage who could have refuted it
political fear mongering at its worst baseless accusations to manipulate public opinion
exactly it was just red meat for his base
the elector college was created for a few reasons by the founders and it was not to weed anyone out the reasons were 1 information due to the time and distance between places in the united states there was a question of ability to make an informed decisions 2 state difference not all states followed a popular vote in the early part of constitution 3 slavery 3 5 compromise slave ca nt vote themselves someone has to vote for them so recap none of these reasons apply anymore we have information common voting system and no slavery thankfully the electoral college is an archaic system that hinders our process as a country if the rules suck we should work to change those rules that why we have amendments
the electoral college was put in place to weed undesirable people out uh about that the electoral college was put in place mainly to keep slavery legal the founding fathers went about setting up a country to keep slavery legal and one of those necessary items was keeping the presidency in the hands of who owned slaves and or who 's sympathies laid with slave owners there 's a reason why most of the us 's early presidents came from virginia biggest populated and pro slave state
you said it trump lives in this space and his supporters back him no matter what if trump did what biden did his supporters would n't be crying about replacing him they 'd say the camera 's lie that no one saw it and the truth is it 's 5d chess honestly 4 months out biden set the bar for himself low now he got up and faced the music today and already people are feeling a little better he can shine in all the speeches going forward but when they get to that second debate joe will have jam every steel rod into his back drink like i do n't know what coctails from abbot labs and just look energetic and make sense and people will freak and say that 's the old biden we knew before
but just like the dog and pony aspect his gish gallop of insane lies and nonsense plus insults is tough to beat yeah americans need to realize that a televised debate reveals nothing about what the vote for president really means we are n't voting for someone who 's effective in a televised debate a president will never need to rebut lies within 3 minutes by themself we 're voting for someone who can put together a good platform a good administration and good appointments including supreme court justices
lol you ’re giving trump far too much credit far far too much he would be crushed easily by any number of people i can think of such as newsom and ocasio cortez obama would have utterly eviscerated him on and on it goes
rachel maddow people may claim spin or cope but i found it a bit interesting biden 's performance was downright awful but the fight is n't over and the media will continue to do what it does and blow things out of proportion like the immediate headlines of replacing biden
except biden spent a week prepping for this one something went wrong either biden s mental state is deteriorating or he tried sleeping during the day with an ambian and it was still in his system when he went to the debate either way it was an incredibly poor look and made the current sitting u s president look like he needs to be in a nursing home my confidence in him has been shattered
the difference is obama was 50 years old when he had a bad debate
it 's called getting in a younger candidate who can actually call him on his shit
and that 's exactly why dems are going to lose this election you 're all gaslighting yourself into thinking trump 's just as bad as biden every article i see on reddit is about how horrible trump looks how he sleeps during trials etc well america just saw the both of them on stage for a 2 hour debate and trump managed to ramble on in a loud and powerful voice for the whole 2 hours meanwhile biden stuttered and mumbled biden on his best day ca n't talk as much as trump on his worst and like the commentators were saying the prevailing sentiment around this election is n't policies which it should be it 's about physical ability biden is getting crushed in that aspect and that 's all the public cares about because republicans have managed to make that the deciding factor in this election
if having the expectation that my chosen candidate did n't look like they were having multiple senior moments mutter almost incoherently throughout the debate and look like they were either going to fall asleep or drop dead in the middle of it then i guess that makes me a 12 year old how dare you have expectations that your candidate not seem like he belongs in the nursing home at 81 years old and look robust enough to be able to handle the presidency everyone in this sub apparently
yes i watched the debate and there is clearly a recording of trump shitting himself during the debate
verbal boxing match instead of a real debate
seriously every bit of information needs to be finished and complete in 10 seconds of tik tok sound bites or we lose our focus
how many voters do you think are gon na sit and read the transcript
the transcript cnn 's anyway elides quite a few of the gaps and pauses it reads much better than the video does imo
we finally beat medicare makes sense jumping the topic tracks from abortion to immigration
look trump is a moron and biden still came out looking worse there is no way to sugarcoat it it 's the worst presidential debate performance in modern history
the absolute insanity in this thread the people pretending biden just was n't on his a game holy fuck they 're deluded it 's been handed to trump
yeah this is bonkers discussing who won the debate is completely irrelevant biden does n't get another term because he actually answered the questions he gets another term by convincing undecideds and turning out his base he accomplished the opposite of that in the debate he was most likely already behind going into the debate this will make it worse i mean if somehow people really did see through all that and are willing to chock it up to a cold we 'll see that in the polling in the next week or two but if that shows a major shift towards trump biden has to think about dropping out and if he is n't he needs to be doing interviews and town hall meetings where he speaks without a script to show everyone the first debate was somehow a fluke we ca n't wait until the next debate after the convention anything less is handing trump the presidency
what says it all was watching msnbc and cnn after the debate the hosts could n't even spin it they barely even played clips like previous post debate analysis because there were literally no clips where biden looked good biden had some neutral moments and the rest of the time was embarrassing trump did a terrible debate and came away as the clear winner any of the other names being floated whitmer newsom etc would have wiped the floor with trump bad debates are not uncommon even for winning candidates but it felt like biden struggled to even participate in the debate you pitied biden for even needing to be there
the gaslighting nonsense about him being the only one who can win is infuriating nah most generic dems would have wiped the floor with trump at the debate and cruise to the election just by virtue of being younger coherent and able to take trump ’s bullshit on directly a stuttering 81 year old is not it
as a sixers fan i wish they would ben simmons was an elite shooter once tge season was over
but the end of the game is 4 months from now so a striking out in the 4th inning does n't determine the game either
i know he fumbled it in the big game but he was great in practice the next day why wo n't people focus on that instead
i think people are dancing around the real issue here which is the time this took place 9 pm on the east coast compared to his rally which was at like 10 or 11 am he 's a sundowner it comes with age not necessarily a medical condition but it 's a clear sign of cognitive decline he does n't do well late at night just look at that video of him basically freezing completely during the juneteenth concert it was sundown and there were a bunch of lights and dude was just in lala land watching them you can make excuses for it but anyone watching that whose ever been in a nursing home knows what that is god forbid someone wants to pop off at 2 am it wo n't be biden making the calls in that scenario
and he did n't even do all that great at the nc speech sure he was able to read from the prompter but there were still a lot of mushmouth talking and confusion he shambled around very slowly with his mouth agape
i really have to disagree here my impression was biden wanted to call him a liar but got so bogged down and confused by the stats and facts that would prove trump was lying that he rarely got around to actually calling him a liar sure he said it a couple times but it should ’ve been said after every trump statement the overall impression is trump lied the moderators agreed to not fact check and biden was simply incapable for whatever reason of consistently calling trump out
find me 4 times in the transcript where biden said that 's a lie the truth is with any bit of coherence here is one of the first questions trump the only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs they ’re bounced back from the covid obvious lies and wtf is trump even saying here this 'll be easy he has not done a good job he ’s done a poor job and inflation ’s killing our country it is absolutely killing us tapper thank you president biden biden well look the greatest economy in the world he ’s the only one who thinks that i think i do n’t know anybody else who thinks it was great he had the greatest economy in the world and you know the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy awkward pause where biden forgets to finish the sentence redacted here he rewarded the wealthy
this is why you do n't debate nazis until you lot realize that you 're not gon na make any progress against them debates are a bad forum for political discussion because all they do is allow the person who can lie the most to spread their bullshit while everybody else stutters and stumbles trying to refute the bullshit and get their own message out it 's why these fuckers value ' debates ' so much unfortunately for all of us trump won this debate the second the democratic party proposed it
gotcha but what about sounding like he can complete a sentence i would give joe points now if he could just speak clearly about anything
because that ’s what matters most for an american president their stage presence god damn you muricans really turns into an idiocracy
i do n't think biden should ever have been on the ticket he should have done one term it seems fairly obvious they 've been covering up his health for some time similar to what happened with reagan you 've had us politicians including some democrats although most are toeing the line and european diplomats voicing concerns for months
there 's seriously a ton of people who want to weekend at bernie 's biden into the white house and see nothing wrong with it saying we should n't have done a debate we should have pushed for it earlier we should only let biden do planned written speeches it 's crazy
and this is why we will lose it ’s hillary 2 0
we 're already committing election suicide by keeping biden as the nominee at least if we choose someone else right now we might have a shot
yup they will always prefer corporatist candidates over true progressives and have shown they ’re willing to lose to maintain that status quo i wish people would figure that out i guess this current two party hellhole situation is kind of the unforeseen natural result of how our elections are set up though
yawn progressives ca n’t win competitive primaries anywhere what makes you think they can win a competitive general election i ’ll agree that bernie could have maybe won in 2016 but that is n’t because he was a progressive it was because he was n’t an establishment candidate these days he ’s a known quantity and most voters do not want him they want the other progressives even less that ’s just the facts of the numbers the progressive wing of the democratic party is small and concentrated to cities only it ’s a losing strategy to court them they lose more votes than they gain
the dnc did n't have to worry about a progressive winning because bernie lost fair and square the fantasy that an evil dnc conspiracy somehow cost him the race is no different than the maga delusion about election fraud hillary got more 3 5 million more votes than bernie that 's why she was the nominee that 's it he lost
was this a surprise to biden quickly debunking trump 's bullshit and moving on to a practical solution is what he should have been practicing for the past month saying malarkey before whispering an incoherent word salad ai n't it
thank god a president does n't have to deal with people lying in high stakes situations otherwise biden would be in trouble
you ca n’t debate lies that s a dumb fucking strategy
at this point in 2020 biden was 8 points in the polls trump is closer to 2 in the polls right now that s a 10 point swing biden can not win
biden did way worse than those two the only saving grace is the trump was worse than those two as well
the reality is that he will lose against trump you can choose a different route or go down but this time all the blame will be on biden supporters no blaming young voters or progressives you get to own it
we ca n’t gaslight the public into seeing something that they clearly saw biden needs to confront the reality that voters are afraid that he is unfit for office after that debate he looked feeble and frail if he is n’t okay which it seems like he is n’t it ’s time to replace him while we still can a third of the voting public is gigantic and i bet you enough swing voters in the battleground state watched that debate
one in ten voters being convinced by the debate is enough to sink biden
the people who are voting against trump are still going to vote against trump that wo n't change no matter who is in the d spot but it 's not enough the checked out or undecided voter needs to be convinced and biden probably just lost them plucking a random democrat off the street would give more credence to the democratic party than trying to convince us biden still has it
without giving him the chance to course correct you ca n't course correct dementia the guy has no business being in office right now much less 4 more years
money making machine for corporate attorneys do n't forget the religious grifters our money literally states that we place our trust in a pretend sky wizard
legal insurance like arag is a solution that 's practical ask your employer to provide this option to its employees
but i 've been told that facts do n't care about my feelings by people whose think their feelings are facts
this the question when spelled out is actually does our propaganda make you feel better than it did 4 years ago
and appearance just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to us trump to the doj referring to himself and republican congressmen
yeah so injecting it did n't seem that far of a stretch to them
i still remember seeing that for the first time i thought i 'd surely misheard what was said it was surreal
right i mean in blue states states like florida still screwed people on unemployment so all we have to do to get back to the 2020 glory days is print like 2 5 t schools need to go virtual again people loved that ca n't buy toilet paper sounds great your favorite bar closed that vacation you were going to take closed sounds great
less money in circulation should equal lower prices though inflation goes up when there 's more money available not less
the moment the fetus leaves the womb it is considered a birth if it ’s breathing it ’s a live birth if it is n’t it ’s a still birth which is very much not an abortion if the baby subsequently dies it ’s a neonatal mortality no such thing as a “ post birth ” abortion because of the draconian anti abortion laws women are being forced to carry and deliver non viable fetuses to term at risk of the mother ’s life and often risking her ability to have a future pregnancy not to mention the trauma of going through the pain of delivery with no hope of a live baby at the end i was a clinic administrator for a group of midwives one woman ’s fetus was discovered to have no head her care was transferred to ob gyn and pregnancy terminated at 4 months now in some us states that woman would be forced to carry and deliver that headless thing that could never survive outside the womb how is that “ pro life ”
the gish gallop ˈɡɪʃ ˈɡæləp is a rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm their opponent by providing an excessive number of arguments with no regard for the accuracy or strength of those arguments gish galloping prioritizes the quantity of the galloper 's arguments at the expense of their quality the term was coined in 1994 by anthropologist eugenie scott who named it after american creationist duane gish and argued that gish used the technique frequently when challenging the scientific fact of evolution
biden did quite unequivocally biden called him a liar after something he said well over ten times often as the opening rebuttal it 's in the transcript
you are correct biden outright said he does not know how to debate a liar plenty of people would not be rattled hell biden was n't rattled the last time he debated trump
biden publicly stated that he had a cold during the debate he sounded better but not 100 % still on friday
or he has a lifelong stutter and was hampered by a debate format that rewarded lying with thank you s and a bad headcold but i agree with you a lying felon is way better than someone whose voice is a little bit hoarse
clearly we should just add the festivus feats of strength to the next debate
you ’re right americans do n’t read we ’ll get what we deserve self fulfilling prophecy
he has a stutter and a cold his projection sucked but when you are trying to debate total and utter falsehoods with actual facts you spend the entire time trying to counter his debate team should have prepped him better because this playbook is n’t new and fed right into the hands of 15 second playback loops
biden came out looking worse because we hold him to a higher standard flooding the field with bullshit and expect him to eloquently breakdown all the falsehoods is impossible his debate prep team really fucked up because these tactics are well known
it is one thing to have a choke job due to underprepared death in the family whatever and have a chance to come back next time it is another to literally be 81 years old and have a bad performance explicitly because of your age which is impossible to reverse even if he did slightly better next debate we all now know that the good days are the exception at this point not the other way around and that is just going to get worse as time goes on
trump even won on roe vs wade how the fuck did biden lose that one i could n't believe it anybody would 've handed that to him throwing stats young rape victims elevated death rates etc and biden brought up something about a migrant girl who was raped or something mumbled on about some shit crazy fucking crazy and in this fucking thread they 're saying biden won the debate holy shit
fr i do n't even like newsome but he would have wiped the floor with the trump that showed up at the debate i do n't think biden is the guy that can beat trump tbh as unfortunate as it is since we do n't have many other options but like another trump term will have permanent global ramifications someone else needs to step up
this is n’t the 4th inning this is already the 7th our star pitcher just gave away 5 runs and we ’re down 8 3 would you switch out the pitcher when you have a chance or are you gon na say nah he good
sun downing is a term that they do n't use much anymore it 's basically the lead up to dementia if you are sun downing then you have some measure of dementia
the mouth agape thing is just awful he looks dumbfounded in every picture i despise his stubborn bullshit fucking get out of the way we ’ve seen it before with rbg and now this octogenarian assholes who think they will live forever
and biden was simply incapable for whatever reason because he ca n't get through a sentence without fucking something up there were many moments where he should have had an easy layup on trump and he fell flat because he just ca n't seem to figure out how to not stumble all over himself like when he ended a segment saying he beat medicare and trump latched onto that and was all yeah that 's right you did beat medicare and i want to fix the damage you did and biden 's on the split screen looking like he shit his pants as he realizes his mistake
the deal when debating a gish gallop liar one does n't go after all the lies one has to pick one lie and just keep on that one lie but in a presidential debate one wants to also point to one 's successes and defend against all the lies that 's an impossible task trump was particularly awful when he debated as president because it 's harder to defend one 's own record with his gish gallop lie technique
no stop you ca n't quote it we 're busy coping in here
if you actually watched the debate you ’d know this just is n’t true he sounded hoarse but he was perfectly coherent the only one that could n’t stay on topic was trump but we hold him to such an impossibly low standard it does n’t matter
the mental gymnastics in this sub is impressive biden was embarrassing period
you have to admit that president dwayne elizondo mountain dew camacho had great stage presence
that ’s half the damn job you have to be able to build a coalition of support for your ideas and plans by effectively communicating it to people biden failed miserably at that trump did too but he has never been judged by that metric is that fair no but it is reality
he 's a candidate right now candidates need to present their visions for the future articulate their policies and fight against their opponent president 's do n't have to do that candidates do and biden failed as a candidate
yes it ’s a shit place i fully agree but stage presence has won debates since 1960 the democrats refuse to recognize that people are fucking idiots and that ’s why they continue to struggle
you fuxking joking me you think what was wrong with bisen was his fuxking stage presence like showbiz is his fuxking week spot fuxk me
this is true everywhere stage presence is important and it 's also not as superficial as you 'd think it 's all about enforcing your own idea and stand your ground both are important as a leader not the only important things for sure but still biden really did n't do well there at all
it 's the ugly truth most people probably could n't name 3 reality based presidential achievements of their preferred candidate they could probably tell you that biden looked like shit on the debate stage though
you should try and listen to concerns rather than dismiss them communicating is of vital importance to a world leader everything they do say wear eat all of it is part of international leadership and management when people say he had bad stage presence they are also saying he ca n't communicate well you can not be a good president without communicating well
yeah it ’s insane same people screaming about democracy at stake want someone to be elected by suppressing information this reddit makes the deepest parts of my soul ache
the dnc and biden should 've at least groomed kamala harris to be a viable replacement by letting her host rallies make speeches do meet and greets news interviews and really attempt to help her build a good reputation with voters after the midterms in the lead up to the election so that all their eggs would n't be in one biden sized basket
saying malarkey before whispering an incoherent word salad ai n't it i guarantee a significant portion if the voting public has no idea what malarkey means and had never heard someone say it before like joe it 's not 1945 anymore
biden should have gone with the bold strategy of saying things ordinary people can understand rather than sounding like an incoherent old man who had no idea what was going on
1 point lead that sure is reassuring do we know the sample saw the debate i do appreciate the source that said thanks
how ’s it looking in the swing states that actually decide the election
it ’s also not backed by anything so its value is equally pretend
in their defense they are conditioned to believe that if they “ believe ” hard enough they go to “ dream paradise ” pretty hard to convince them that belief is n’t fact after childhood conditioning like that the single most important thing that can be taught in schools is the habit of considering the motives of the speaker and whether or not the content is consistent with direct observation
do magats have any card to play other than projection
which is why reducing the amount of money we take out of circulation results in inflation
examples like the one you quoted are necessary in the anti abortion crowd because the women like the one you quoted with a fetus without a head serve as examples how they keep people from gaming the system and using any law allowing any form of abortion to abort fetuses with tiny birth defects like major malformations or lethal genetic issues i feel stupid even writing this fuck the antiabortion people all of them every day
debates are n’t about the transcript
this is n't the first time biden has acted like this though there 's been many reports over the past year that he 's been getting worse and worse that 's what i 'm worried about i do n't think he 's gon na win and we need to defeat trump
who said anything about a lying felon we 're talking about the fact that biden gave everyone the impression of being unfit regardless of who his opponent is i 'm not voting for trump but that 's not what we 're discussing you 're the one bringing up trump biden did a poor job by himself trump did n't make him look back biden made himself look bad stop with this deflection and what aboutism start asking for more from your politicians
oh come on if he had a cold they would have been messaging that all day long before the debate so that they would have an out if he sounded terrible and if he sounded good all the better they only pushed out that spin after he self immolated in the first 15 minutes
was n't joe being prepped in camp david for a week he was resting and being set up to be in tip top shape i 'm really curious how someone under 24 7 pressure could handle things he could n't even form a proper sentence with days of prep and rest
he fucked up even the easy ones like abortion he fucked up he had no higher standard he was just supposed to show that the senile claims from the gop were bullshit he did the opposite if he were running against anyone other than trump and had that performance he would be getting even more shit so spare me the higher standard line his bar was low and he did n't clear it
trump under roe v wade you have late term abortion you can do whatever you want depending on the state you can do whatever you want we do n’t think that ’s a good thing we think it ’s a radical thing we think the democrats are the radicals not the republicans again obvious lies and surely a huge slam dunk is coming biden for 51 years that was the law 51 years constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go 51 years and it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the supreme court takes credit for taking it away
biden presented actual policies in the debate trump just spewed out a firehose of falsehood while refusing to answer questions on policy obviously you did n’t pay attention to what was actually said just how it was said
avoiding interviews has actually been pretty good for harris ' reputation
i do n’t think harris is the answer she ’s not charismatic or popular she has a certain fakeness that kind of reminds me of hillary i hate to say it but i ’m pretty sure they only picked her to counter the fact that biden ’s an old white guy edit and it ’s not like she ’s been locked away somewhere she does press appearances and speeches she ’s just not very likeable or interesting so they do n’t get media attention
the dnc keeps harris under somewhat under wraps because most of the country irrationally hates her even more than biden and maybe no one more than progressives why are we all acting like somehow harris and newsom are these hugely popular candidates outside of the mainstream being held down by the dnc it was n’t establishment democrats who tried to get newsom recalled and last i checked harris was allowed to run for president and her run was quickly and viciously torpedo’ed by the bernie bros on account of her having been a prosecutor and she was picked for vp anyway because the mainstream moderate left voters like her way more than progressives do they want her to potentially lead the party buttigieg as well they want very badly for those two to build up better reputations but they have to rehab them after people in their own party destroyed them
harris is not in the dnc plan they want newsom witmer next time around that is why biden has kept harris in the background
if the value of the money is based on nothing but faith then putting big sky daddy on there as the backer seems apropos somehow
the timeliness of a nations recovery from the great depression is directly linked with how quickly they progressed away from the gold standard
i agree i wish people would look at the photos and 3d sonography of these rare but real horrendous birth defects there is no sweet cheeked wiggly warm bundle at the end of these women ’s delivery there is no chance the infant will survive even minutes outside the womb and those minutes might very well be pure pain and torture for that infant it is simply cruelty i also believe it is simply cruel to force a woman to continue an unplanned pregnancy it took two people to create that unplanned pregnancy why should a woman face the derision shaming and blow to her career education while the sperm donor simply walks away that ’s why it ’s a woman ’s right to choose not a man ’s if they develop the technology to transfer the unplanned fetus into a man or uterine replicator that the man is then responsible for fine until that time women have the right to choose not the men
no but calling out someone should have refuted it is because biden did he point blank said trump is a liar and refuted it as per the transcripts
exactly trump lobbed dozens of softballs including the 9 month abortion lie the front page should be full of clips where biden just dunks on him dunks on him hard instead he could barely speak
did you actuallt watch the debate or are you just going based off of cherry picked transcripts the amount of people telling me i did n't see what i saw is honestly very concerning to me
i watched the whole thing i watched joe biden take a bread and butter question about abortion and fumble it into a migrant killing topic i watched him debate trump about golf swings for 2 minutes
in trump vs harris trump wins the popular vote it would be a bloodbath new york and california would be purple
yeah when did political parties get so political
i did actually watch the entire thing and your listening comprehension skills clearly failed you trump lost his train of thought way more than biden did he just sounds confident and hides it by the constant stream of bullshit that leaves his mouth try going back and reading the transcripts of the debate it ’s clear that trump is incoherent and a pathological liar meanwhile biden actually answered the questions and focused on legitimate policies instead of partisan lies last time i checked constantly lying and refusing to answer the debate questions should disqualify someone as a serious candidate but sure just disregard all of the content that both candidates actually said all that matters to your little brain is how they said it not what they said
right there with you the pod save america guys said basically the same thing agreeing with you in their friday morning episode
you are just making your own strawmen you saw what you saw but you also failed to actually listen to what was being said biden did terribly due to his age but trump was far less “ presidential ” during the debate
this is the usual political spin people that are obsessed with politics their candidates do of course when trumpers do it it 's really bad and cult like behavior but when biden supporters do it we 're just focusing on the transcript and he actually did a great job really you 're just cherry picking a few moments it 's embarrassing watching them not able to just admit biden had a really bad night and clearly fumbled the debate it happens admit it move on stop trying to turn into trumpers where you defend every awful moment
preach i watched the whole thing and trump did his usual bullshit no change there in 8 years biden looked and sounded horrible all the way through and completely fulfilled all of the negative accusations regarding his age he was completely incapable of articulating virtually anything and has no business being the candidate there is a 0 % chance he will win this election now after this at least if he dropped out the democrats would still have a decent chance with an energized new face personally i ’d love to see whitmer or pete
sure on content biden won no doubt almost everyone commenting in this sub is a strong d supporter and would still vote for biden if he died tomorrow we get that trump is the worst person in the world for democracy but the debate is also a presentation to the undecided uninformed and weak supporters of the democratic party albert mehrabian a renowned expert on nonverbal communication suggests that 55 % of any message is conveyed through nonverbal elements facial expressions gestures posture etc 38 % through vocal elements tone of voice pitch etc and 7 % through verbal elements words biden failed to win over the people he needed to simply based on his inability to cohesively deliver a point wide eye looking into space weak verbal defenses and many other gaffes
i saw what i saw but you didnt listen it was a disaster keep gaslighting
we 're just focusing on the transcript i know people do n't focus on transcripts because were that the case there 's no way trump would 've gotten elected very early on because i could not stomach watching or hearing trump i read the transcripts he 's a ranting incoherent embarrassment what i 'm saying is there 's really no need to cherry pick here biden made great points while looking old trump looked less old while lying his butt off about everything it was the debate where both candidates were awful
name 1 policy that trump championed during the debate you ca n’t because all he did was shit on america and make up lies to attack his opponent the whole time
it was a debate and 1 candidate spent the whole time spewing provable lies the other candidate focused on policies and the truth trump was an absolute disaster at actually debating compared to biden americans are just so stupid that they care more about appearances than substance and do n’t get me wrong biden is absolutely too old to be president but trump is a far worse option and he performed worse at actually debating policy
he should be in prison for the rest of this century
twice impeached convicted felon found liable for rape
i made a list of everything trump said during the debate that is n't a lie 01 we got hit with covid 02 biden created mandates biden did a mandate on the vaccine 03 the jobs went down and then they bounced back 04 biden made a statement 05 i was getting out of afghanistan 06 the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent 07 200 billion dollars is a lot of money 08 the supreme court just approved the abortion pill 09 texas is different florida is different 10 the states are making their own decisions right now and right now the states control abortion abortion is now back with the states 11 biden put the suckers and losers quote in commercials 12 i fired the general that you mentioned 13 we have an ocean separating us and ukraine 14 the european nations together have spent 100 billion on ukraine or maybe more than that 15 we have a debate 16 i funded historically black colleges and universities 17 we had h2o 18 we mentioned “ russia russia russia ukraine ukraine ukraine ” 19 i did fire a lot i fired comey i fired a lot of the top people at the fbi 20 we were using all forms of energy 21 biden said he inherited 9 percent inflation inflation blew up under his leadership 22 we have polling 23 biden never took out my tariffs that i imposed on china he never took them away 24 i took two cognitive tests 25 we left billions of dollars of equipment behind in afghanistan 26 i got along with putin very well
it held three hours passed both their bedtimes and 15 years passed retirement age
yeah let 's prop up this felon and try to make it legit fuck you media
the debate was biden ’s idea
alright but he was he lied he was unapologetically trump most importantly he made biden look like a frail old man in comparison
i remember everyone bet he would n't show up biden 's the one who invited him to debate and set this whole thing up so honestly the blame is kind of on him for arranging it if trump should n't be given the platform
disagree like it or not he ’s the republican candidate what should have been on that stage are the god damned spines of the debate moderators if either candidate flat out lies they need to be chin checked with hard facts it just so happens lying is like breathing for trump biden struggled big time but trump fomented more fucking salacious lies and brain broke bullshit than ever before we can not have that
a little late to cry foul about it is n't it
the fact that fascist racist rapist felon who tried to overthrow the govt and if wins will be the end of the usa is even a consideration shows how many truly repulsive horrible people live in this country
i would argue that joe biden should not have been o stage either
trump does n't belong in this race he 's a traitor
watched the debates with my wife did anyone notice how weird trumps tie looked it looked all boxy we kept joking that he was hiding a radio in there and people were giving him answers after the fact when his mike was off that 's why he kept going back to previous answered questions rather than the one he was just asked
my opinion biden practiced too much hurt his voice and they wanted him to try to shove a bunch of talking points in possible and he stutters trying to get it all out let him just be himself and off the cuff that ’s how he works best no memorizing long speeches
i would have liked it to be two candidates under 65 that can complete a though and or not be a pos
we know but he was on the stage millions of people are planning to vote for him instead of crying about it what is the plan for beating him in the election so that we do n’t have to see articles for 4 years titled “ donald trump should not be president ” while women lose their rights minority groups are discriminated against and he does all the other shitty things that he plans to do too much to list
to be fair the biden campaign are the ones who pushed for the debate morons
biden never should have debated the piece of shit in the first place
this is unbelievable cope the stages of grief of how biden went have reached anger
but he was and biden was incapable of drawing any sort of contrast we ’re just ignoring reality
but joe “ we finally beat medicare ” biden definitely should have been on the debate stage
donald trump should not be outside of prison
a week ago establishment dems were begging for a debate biden challenged him what happened
he should be in jail
and neither should biden biden needs to step down and we need a viable dem candidate
john king cnn said it best in the 90 ’s washington started to disenfranchise the rural and the midwest with globalization the republican rural voters took that emotion and found a bombastic entertaining immoral candidate the absolute anti politician who could blow up washington and us policy the republic of states was desperate to govern independently at the state level in response to the insensitive national policies all republican states and others are basically anti gov in washington vive a la difference is trump going to blow up washington yup as his people want unless the dems learn to embrace policy which gives more independance and makes us policy more flexible this really has nothing to do with trump
a lot of things should n't be happening in this country right now so at this point
the media is working overtime to flush out the fact that the democrats have propped up a carcass huh this whole damn thing was biden 's own idea ya'll got dementia now too is it viral
nono yes he should have been he is the unhideable face of the republican party and a weight around their neck there is no holier than thou acceptance for the followers of the republican party with him at the helm he is a mirror to them all where they go one they go all may thebparty and its followers wallow in their cowardice so that people who give a shit can make grueling change beyond my life time for a better world
biden was n’t fit to be on stage either
what 's even the point of saying this maybe he should n't have been on the stage but in reality he was and he 's on the ballot too he 's running for president short of him actually dying that 's probably not going to change and after that debate the polls are probably going to show that he 's winning we need to fight the fight we 're actually in and not the hypothetical one we wish we were in
neither candidate should have been allowed to be on that stage nor should they be allowed to run for office but here we are
what the electoral college has done to this country is a disgrace it ’s absolutely unacceptable we should all be ashamed of ourselves we need to give the power to the majority not a handful of voters in the swing states it ’s a failed idea
neither of them should have been on that stage
that either of these parties could drop their candidate and win in a landslide has my tinfoil hat saying corporate america is in control and is fine with these choices because they truly pull the strings
i am disgusted that biden did not step in at the start moderators i would like to correct you on a point of fact i joe biden am the president please refer to my opponent as former president make that mistake again and i will insist you refer to him as his most recent title convicted felon
would n't it be great if biden did n't have to run against or debate anyone basically is the gist of this article
yeah no shit trump should n't have been on the stage or a ballot or at 50 % in nearly every poll for the past year but he was and is biden lost the debate and biden will lose the election so fucking replace him and shut the fuck up trying to act like the republicans will suddenly start having principles again or grow spines stop expecting that the undecided 's and unmotivated young people are going to turn out to vote for biden they will not those of us who are patriots will vote for a ham sandwich to keep trump out if we have to but it is n't us and people paying attention to politics that will decide this election just because we are passionate about keeping this fascist out
no he should be in jail yet here we are
hearing him shit himself on multiple different feeds was gross but satisfying 1 16 22 when he 's talking about the china tariffs
you ’re right what he did to biden elderly abuse
he 's convincing people that lying all the time is perfectly ordinary and to look at it as a skill
yeah but he was and performed as expected biden objectively shit the bed most of us in the sub skew liberal but you got ta be realistic here biden needs to drop out and pass the baton asap he ’s not the best person to beat trump this year
this was n't a debate let 's just be clear on that what is a debate to engage an opponent in the act of debate to discuss a question by considering opposed arguments a regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides notice discuss that 's a back and forth proposing of viewpoints on an issue being debated there was no such discussion this was a jab fest and unfortunately joe biden was n't feeling well overcome by a sore throat and probably very tired from a long day of work the debate was in atlanta ga a very short trip for trump who has no real job at present in any case a man who has been twice impeached charged with over 100 felony counts unanimously convicted on 34 felony counts and owes a fine of close to 1 2 billion usd for having committed fraud should not be a presidential candidate period
and apparently either should joe biden with his cold this is embarrassing and i voted for biden
it ’s biden who should n’t have been on that stage given his performance just lost him the election
oh no he should have it ’s just that he should n’t have been allowed to lie without being called out we made it acceptable to allow him to lie without consequences
of course not if the republican party had a shred of integrity they would n’t nominate a convicted felon sexual predator narcissistic con man and world class liar who fomented an insurrection and stole classified information but they have no integrity so here we are biden is old and his pride is preventing him from stepping down but he is n’t any of the above and considering what he inherited he ’s done a good job if the choice is between an old man who surrounds himself with intelligent well qualified people and a criminal who wants to be a dictator i know who i ’m voting for and it is n’t the one who banged a porn star
you spelled joe biden wrong
wait i was told by people on here that trump was too scared to show up and that biden would destroy him what happened guys
this is just full damage control now i ca n’t stop laughing at you guys the democrats should have nominated a coherent candidate if you wanted to beat trump biden did fine in debates 4 years ago with trumps tactics
the flailing is a magical thing to watch
biden should not of been on that stage either
scary that people on reddit think saying trump is a liar and a criminal is going to change any minds republicans nominated him knowing all this and he ’s consistently polled ahead of biden if trump is this existential threat that we can all see coming a mile away joe biden is the person you expect to stop it his debate performance was so catastrophically bad buckle up because a landslide loss is coming in november put all this energy spent trying to remind people trump is a liar and a felon everyone knows into replacing joe biden at the top of the ticket otherwise this person who “ should n’t have been on that debate stage ” is going to be back in the white house
listen i ’ll be voting for biden but he should n’t have been on the stage either this is the best we can do if trump gets elected america and the world is really f ed and this is the best we can do it ’s just sad the fabric of my world is getting eaten away i feel helpless and like i ’m suffocating
america is a joke of a nation the people who support either biden or trump should both be equally embarassed
this sub is going through all seven stages of grief at once
wow y all are still melting down
liberals try not to impose soviet style exile of political opponents impossible challenege
i do n’t think he ’ll live quite that long
and if biden did his duty as commander in chief trump would be in prison i think biden should step down but not because of the debate because he clearly ca n't handle the responsibilities of the job which includes defending the country from domestic threats like y'know coup attempts and attacks on the capitol
this is disingenuous he was not convicted during impeachment trials and the felony charges are still ongoing as they are awaiting the resolution of the appeals process
this is the coverage i wanted thank you
23 was in response to a question about the opioid crisis so i do n’t know if it should count lol
over a quarter of a hundred truths so many truths
27 biden needs to fire more people starting with the prep team
23 biden never took out my tariffs that i imposed on china he never took them away it was too much money wet fart
at least biden let the world know he beat medicare that was important
good thing this happened in june and not october americans have the worst memory
every post before the debate was “ trump is gon na find a way to back out because he ’s a coward let them debate ” now it ’s “ he should n’t be up there ” maybe next time throw his ass in jail immediately after a coup attempt and this does n’t happen you guys got me fucked up
biden did that on his own
the libs still ca n’t get over that he lies yup he always has lied now what ’s your plan to beat him
just like 2016 try to prop trump up as an easy victory then lose to him has no one learned anything
kyle clark is the hero all of these debates need
i 'm sorry but it 's not the moderator 's job to debate the people on stage biden is the one running for president he 's the one prepped to fact check trump he had or should have all the tools he needs to do what you 're blaming the moderators for not doing
while i agree in real time fact checking i think it should be a scroll or header on the screen not done by the moderators imo the moderators should be there to present the questions and keep things moving the debate should n't be the candidate vs the moderators
the moderators ask questions it ’s not their job to debate trump that ’s why biden was there
that ’s bidens job and he clearly was not up to the task
can you please highlight what he lied about genuinely curious
imagine complaining about trump being on the stage at this point imagine it no the media should ’ve been fact checking every statement in real time if anything during the debate trump got away with carte blanche lie after lie because his presentation was more energetic early on and less mumbled pathetic on the part of the beltway in other words perception matters more than cold hard facts to them being stated or not which he played on well
tells you how bad things are the biden team set the rules and should 've made sure biden brought his a game like did the following day in north carolina
careful reddit has been damage controlling this whole thing since comments were shut down as people were starting to say this and since that same individual has made a huge turn around since being on the stage i ’d argue he has n’t and that we ’re expected by the dnc to just read the quality of what he said in transcripts people that are already going to vote for him will do that people that do n’t have a clue what they ’re going to do will not do that
“ in as possible “ see i get jumbled typing let alone trying to spit out 100 words a minute
agreed half of biden is better than a compulsive liar piece of garbage like trump
how will the minority groups be discriminated
what rights would women lose minorities are n't discriminated white men are the most heavily discriminated demographic today this whole dei agenda is the only form of systemic racism
it 's truly remarkable living in america and not being tribalistic checking r conservative and r politics during the debate in the hours after the debate in the days after the debate watching the comments turn from people giving honest reactions in the moment to forming their narratives to being in full blown echo chamber spin mode it 's incredible
so you 're defending the guy who lied for 90 mins straight can we please attack the bad guy already
the people voted for biden the left claims that trump is a threat to democracy but you want to replace the guy chosen by the people
the electoral college was a great idea when it worked the way it was supposed to the problem is the winner take all system which most states now have for the electoral votes which is something the founders of the country never intended it needs to be reformed not abolished otherwise you end up with people like trump kanye west and kim kardashian elected
actually he did nothing to biden trump was as usual weak and stupid he lied he evaded answering questions and he rambled nonsense
stop making excuses for the man he is way to old and his mind is gone
i ’m just sitting here getting higher than astronaut pussy from the copium fumes
the problem is that it does n't matter that you know who you 're voting for and i know who i 'm voting for the people who do n't pay attention and only watched that debate by a ratio of 2 1 will vote for trump if biden is n't replaced we are completely and utterly fucked otherwise no matter how many people on reddit say i 'm still voting biden
democrats do n’t support biden they believe in the ideals he will push republicans support and love trump the man because he lets them express their bigoted racist sexist homophobic beliefs because he is also all of those things hate is the core of the maga ideology they are not the same and the only embarrassment is trump and his followers
nobody said he had to be alive
from your lips to gods ears
probably for some combination of the 34 felony convictions already lodged the obvious breach of national security that judge cannon refuses to bring to trial and for trying to bring an end to our country ’s 200 year tradition of peaceful transitions of power
you ’re right it should be for longer than that
not a word you wrote refuted the comment you called disingenuous
appeal can not be filed till after sentencing he has been convicted on 34 counts of fraud that conviction will stand as record unless an appeal is won his appeal for being found liable for rape has been denied he was also impeached twice that means both sides of the aisle found his indiscretions prominent enought to vote he should be put on trial
he was not convicted during impeachment trials i did n't say he was i said he was impeached twice which is true the felony charges are still ongoing no he was found guilty he is a convicted felon he is appealing that conviction but he 's still a convict and will be sentenced soon
convicted having been declared guilty of a criminal offense by the verdict of a jury or the decision of a judge he is a convicted criminal
he ’s a “ 34 time convicted felon with a pending appeal and convicted of sexual assault ” do n’t half ass it if you care about full disclosures
“ impeachment ” is what the house does the senate “ trial ” is to determine whether the person impeached should be removed from office even though trump was not removed from office he remains twice impeached
and the felony charges are still ongoing as they are awaiting the resolution of the appeals process he 's a convicted felon
nope both those statements were completely factual it would actually be impossible for someone to be twice impeached in the way you 're describing as if the senate had convicted him the first time he 'd have been removed from office so yes he was impeached by the house of representatives twice once for extorting a foreign official for political information and again for inciting a fucking coup and a jury of his peers has found him guilty of 34 felonies linked to him falsifying documents to interfere in the only presidential election the dumb ass loser ever actually won these are facts
he was impeached he was not removed from office the charges have been settled all 34 of them yes there are more in other cases and yes he can appeal but those 34 are not still ongoing he is just awaiting sentencing just like the 5 kids that were convicted and went to prison for 13 years after trump took out a full page ad in the nyt calling for their execution they were convicted felons until 13 years later when it was finally proven they were innocent btw he still stands by his calling for them to be executed even though they were found innocent
he was impeached impeachment occurs in the house removal from office occurs in the senate the senate not voting to remove him does not change that fact
the felony charges were returned with a unanimous guilty verdict trumps a felon being sentenced in two weeks there ’s a lot of convicted criminals in jail serving life sentences while still appealing their case and furthermore an appeal does n’t make you innocent there ’s no doubt trump did it his defense was that it was legal and the law the courts and the jury disagreed with that so he will appeal it as far as he can but it does not ever mean that he is not a convicted felon
grown ups are having a conversation get you chocolate milk from mommy and do n't chime in when you are oblivious to the meaning of your own words
enjoy voting for a dictator
if only a hundred quarters of people made 25 people
i ’d like to see him fire dejoy
i do n’t see any prep team helping biden he ’s just too old at this point he struggled to speak throughout the debate
this has been widely verified on reddit someone posted the cspan video and you ca n’t miss it
trump said hispanics were stealing black jobs biden flubbed trump lied and rage baited at least the water was better under trump s
i rather have a president make a mistake and say that for one second than have a criminal narcissistic liar claim an election was stolen for 4 years and take serious steps to over turn it all based on lies i sadly have to remind some of you
and in response trump said biden wants to end social security is n’t that the republican wet dream trump does n’t know what team he ’s playing for i ’ll take old over lying cheating raping gaslighting corrupt convicted felon any day
oh so that ’s why donald said he never slept with a porn star because biden took his boner pills and he could not get it up so he did not think it counted and the whole world needed to know during the united states presidential debate as the republican nominee thanks for letting me know bro
exactly the moderators rescuing biden would ’ve only added to the narrative what makes us comfortable as a party and what ’s going to win this election is not the same
how was biden supposed to fact check trump and answer the questions he was asked trump spent almost his entire time just throwing crap at the walls it 's not biden 's job to clean all of that up
no a person needs to call it out it ’s more impactful
biggest lies to me “ biden ’s ” inflation and post birth abortions i am have really not happy with biden for not fighting back on them enough inflation anyone who tells you biden caused inflation has not looked at a notice how the us went up with all those other countries that ’s due to post pandemic inflation also we dropped sooner than many of them trump was n’t going to magically avoid that inflation post birth abortion a lie based on comments made by a previous va gov trump even said where it came from that night his comment was from being asked if a mother wanted an abortion during labor he answered in the context of the baby being unviable or severely deformed if a mother is in labor i can tell you exactly what would happen northam said the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that ’s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother this means the parents need to talk to the doctors that ’s all does n’t mean we will “ rip the baby out and kill it ” it ’s stupid to believe that
genuinely full of it is what you are
too many to list all of them but to start denied having sex with a porn star said the us economy is in the worst state it ’s ever been in said he never called veterans “ suckers and losers ” said his handling of covid was some of the best the world had to offer at the time etc etc you can watch the debate if you ’re interested at least 80 % of the filth that fell out of is prolapsed mouth was bullshit
yeah i wish there was another dude on stage who could have verbally attacked this bad man that lies constantly
it is a debate it was bidens job to call out and fact check his opponent he failed at that along with everything else
we will have to agree to disagree see you at the ballot box peace to you
all those and if he had n't been rich and powerful he would have been locked up for sexual assault long ago
what were the felony charges for i just do n't know
lol i respect your opinion i actually love it i disagree though
so if the charges are dropped after the appeal are you still going to call him a convicted felon
you are an angry little guy huh
spell correctly and maybe i will chocolate milk is delicious you should try it maybe you would n’t be such a dour little angwy chronically online balding rage monkey
the president ca n't fire the postmaster general the pmg is appointed by the board of governors of the postal service
but his and obama ’s appointees to the usps board say he is doing a good job and they continue to support him
but that would make him desad
do n't try to watter down the fact that biden let everyone know he beat medicare he locked up for a moment but he was able to finally regain himself and let the people know how important it was to him that he beat medicare
yeah he said it repeatedly along with hundreds of other lies he streamed over and over
trump did nothing new it was the same garbage he ’s been spewing for years immigration the economy china this should have been an easy layup for biden and he failed his retorts were “ malarky and morals of an alley cat ” it took him 60 mins to mention he ’s a convicted felon his debate performance was poor beyond just his voice and looks
how was biden supposed to fact check trump and answer the questions he was asked because he was the one debating moderators are there to moderate i e to make sure the debate goes smoothly not to be someone 's corner men rebutting false claims is the job of the debaters if the moderators had tried to do biden 's job for him he 'd have looked even worse than he did trump would certainly have pounced on that
they should just have a big red light and a horn that goes off during every lie
1 i would to 2 damn near is 3 i challenge you to find a single shred of evidence to substantiate the claim that he said this 4 inherently the metric for how covid was “ handled ” is extremely mercurial and that statement comes off as more of an opinion as such if he believes he did it ’s not so much that he ’s lying it would be more so that he ’s just wrong
tapper and bash had every opportunity but forced biden to use his time to correct the lies cnn is the worst
he answered the questions he told the truth he pointed out lies he talked about policy he 's old we know but do n't ignore the rest so what are you talking about
falsifying business records done so to hide reimbursements to cohen for hush money to stormy daniel 's
falsifying business and tax records to circumvent campaign finance regulations in his bid to win the 2020 election
no because then the felonies will no longer apply he will be a convicted felon until he successfully appeals felonies do nt magically disappear during the appeal process
so if the charges are dropped after the appeal are you still going to call him a convicted felon i 'll say he was convicted of felonies since he technically wo n't be a convicted felon anymore or i 'll call him formerly convicted felon
you ’re bold faced lying and acting like people correcting you are “ mad ” about it you ’re a joke dawg
biden did not try to overthrow the democratic system when he lost when is the right wing in this country going to understand that those of us who do not support this insanity are driven to turn out to vote against it not for biden maybe someday if when sanity returns to our system we can start fielding and voting for candidates that better reflect our personal desires right now though things have devolved so terribly that the biggest issue driving engagement is to simply keep practicing democracy and as long as there is an opportunity for trump and his ilk to burn it all down then that will untie the opposition until rationality is restored and it is “ safe ” once again to vote on ones individual desires policy priorities until then the only thing that matters is voting against blowing up this experiment because without it the rest will never get addressed biden is old he was old in 2020 and he ’s older now this fact was already baked in it will not sway folks to trump the most it may do is drive apathy but the alternative is so undesirable that i do not think it will have an impact on turn out
biden flubbed once or twice while trump constantly lied and whined and never answered a question trump failed that debate so stop trying to water down these facts with one of biden 's simple slip ups
i love that idea picturing it made me laugh out loud thank you
i would to you would deny it but would you do it fuck a pornstar while your wife is off spawning your broodling
cnn is to blame the venue biden picked with the rules everyone agreed to excuse me i 'm off to go and drink some bleach this is too dumb
because if we ca n’t disagree and still respect each other this country really will fall apart
what exactly did i bold face lie about gee homie dawg finna finna blood cuh
he was old in 2020 and he ’s older now this fact was already baked in it will not sway folks to trump the most it may do is drive apathy but the alternative is so undesirable that i do not think it will have an impact on turn out guess we shall see do you think biden is still the best option for the dnc to put up for this election crazy that this is the best 2 people america can come up with to run the most powerful nation in the world right why ca n't we have someone younger
i 've accepted that a lot of people do n't care about truth or facts because they want to be conned and to feel special i 'm in a blue state but still i 'm gon na vote and encourage everyone else to vote too
what that does n’t address the question
rent free lol the irony
it does n't even matter than you lied your opinion on the matter has not and never will change the facts
do you think biden is still the best option for the dnc to put up for this election at this point this late in the game it is the only option the die is cast again my point was that most do not consider biden the “ best option ” but the “ only option ” considering the alternative crazy that this is the best 2 people america can come up with to run the most powerful nation in the world right i do n’t know how long you ’ve been kicking around on this rock for but the parties in this country selling themselves out to private interests and essentially not “ differing ” in their policies rich get richer fuck the poor for several decades led to an apathy some initially driven i ’m sure in this country that apathy toward our democratic process legitimate or not has led us here only we can get back out and that takes effort why ca n't we have someone younger see my answer above we get the government we participate in not the one we feel we deserve by just being around we can have younger candidates but we got ta fix this fucking mess first
your why was n’t very specific my apologies
your question was “ why ” and nonspecific if you want a particular answer phrase your question better
i pay rent no irony
come on dude do n’t play dumb why do n’t you think trump deserves to be in jail
bro the legal system you want to work so badly is the reason he ’s not in jail your fellow citizens are not your enemy
holy crap they decide they can legally accept bribes and then the same week they decide they can decide on issues that corporations have a vested interest in turning in their favour they can place and order and pay for it and the justices of the sc can deliver it to them the usa is going to dissolve pretty quickly if this is the case
get this story to the top asap this is the biggest story of the year and maybe more
project 2025 does n’t require the annoying orange felon see
this country is well on its way to being a complete and utter dystopian shithole
it would be extremely unfortunate if the supreme court were to face public outcry
this news is being overshadowed by the debate but the supreme court overturning the chevron deference is one of the most consequential decisions that will affect our political system and our systems of checks and balances for decades to come the supreme court just gave itself the most amount of power since 1803 when it gave itself the sole power to decide whether laws are constitutional or not the us constitution flawed though it is has already answered the question of who gets to decide how to enforce our laws the constitution says quite clearly that congress passes laws and the president enforces them the supreme court constitutionally speaking has no role in determining whether congress was right to pass the law or if the executive branch is right to enforce it or how presidents should use the authority granted to them by congress for an unelected panel of judges to come in above the agencies and tell them how the president is allowed to enforce laws is a perversion of the constitutional order and separation of powers and a repudiation of democracy itself
walp time to double the size of the supreme court and add in term limits for em
this court is filled with extremists who just opened the way for companies to legally put lead in your bottled water
scotus will most likely be the catalyst to the next american revolution
wonder if they will still teach about checks and balances in civics
this was not just a power grab it was a coup they did n't just kneecap the executive branch they gutted congress 's ability to legislate as well how exactly is congress supposed to legislate now 40 years of laws have been written under the chevon doctrine the courts made the will of the american people irrelevant
this is why they were selected by trump it was n’t about abortion it was about making sure the wealthy keep their money and access to things that generate their wealth why do you think they bribe the supreme court 1 millions of dollars
i wish more supreme court stories pops up instead of the debate because we ’re fucked sorry there ’s no other way to say it
lead is back on the menu
the chevron doctrine being overturned is waaaaaaay more impactful than anything they 've done even throwing away abortion rights i do n't even know how the government is supposed to function now the senate can not pass anything right now and even on a good day it 's 1 corrupt senator away from throwing away perfectly fine lol though terribly right wing legislation i give up
america 's constitutional crisis is nearing its completion
it may take a while but there will certainly be disruptions in the normal function of gov does any fed employee let alone dept heads and other executives have any experience executing their agency ’s mission without being allowed to read between the lines when the law does n’t specify a procedure for every action
this court is fooling no one or should n’t be in reality the agencies are adhering to the intent of the legislation and enacting the will of the people we said we want safe workplaces osha fair labor standards dol to protect the rights of workers to organize nlra and on and on down the line these agencies have one thing in common they protect the rights of regular people against powerful and kleptocratic corporations by overturning chevron the court now requires congress to pass every one of these protections piecemeal they know damn well that with a nation this polarized congress has no chance of being able to do that so the corporations get to take us back to the robber baron era and we are powerless to stop them the scale of this court ’s regressiveness is almost unimaginable not under regan nixon any republican administration ever could we have imagined a court this regressive they are happily marching us back to the level of civilization we had here 150 200 years ago those were not sage or comfortable times to live in for us regular people this court has marched past “ conservative ” marched past “ regressive ” they ’ve even marched past “ radical ” they do n’t even represent conservative jurisprudence they are a different breed altogether they are honestly just a 5th column of agents working to dismantle the government so that this kleptocrat society that they work for can achieve their fever dream power without limit that ’s all this is at this point it ’s a coup of the government bought and paid for by the kleptocrats who will fill the vacuum created by this court and assume control of our society
as an originalist and a patriot i ’m wondering where the tar and feathers are kept
this is a direct result of citizens united roberts can shake his head but he sold the country to the highest bidder
from one of the most corrupt court in our history
big business is scrambling right now to figure out how to fuck people over for more money or more likely they got a tip that this was coming and are putting plans into action
this needs to be permanently posted on the front page so in a few years the republicans that voted for this shit can see exactly when they ruined our country
biden should have been pushing to expand the court there were 9 appellate courts when the justice was set at 9 one for each appellate court there are now 13 appellate courts there should be 13 justices
my dad had cancer for 10 years before he died of it in his last year he was so weak and feeble he was a shadow of his former self when he finally died i did n't even cry i realized later i 'd already mourned him and i 'd seen him as a dead man for a while this is america 's democracy maybe biden will win and maybe elections will happen but the cancer is everywhere the supreme court will weigh the scales in favor of republicans rule from the bench and rule any democratic gains unconstitutional republicans in congress will block what the supreme court does n't if trump does lose project 2025 will just become project 2029 or 2033 i feel like this whole sub is mourning a democracy that is n't dead but it would take a miracle to save
packing the courts was never going to ' fix ' the institution it was a temporary move to head off these inevitable rulings while a better solution was created now to fix the severe amount of damage caused dems will have to go full jackson and just declare this court 's rulings invalid which is a much more chaotic dangerous option
and this is why i ’m voting for biden
illegitimate scotus we should just ignore their rulings texas does
ok i ’m actually really starting to get scared reading project 2025 save act going down the drain then this and the debate what in the actual fuck is going on
just more of the nightmare trump has visited on this country
career professional congress approved agencies do n't have final word judges do who are also allowed to take tips as long as they 're after the fact appointed for life by politicians who do n't have to report where their unlimited funding is coming from
a ruling that is bad for every life well i 'm glad clarence finally got to change his mind for his bohemian grove billionaire buddies that parade him around like the shiny sellout that he is maybe after this final ask clarence the fraud will dishonorably retire so he can finally realize his dream of living like a billionaire may all 6 of these bench legislating justices lives be made miserable by a civilly disobedient bipartisan public
it 's not quite true that nobody is above the law if nine five people can effectively decide the law
how can a republican supreme court take away abortion rights make bribes legal etc and their candidate is a convicted felon rapist fascist shithole of human and then biden stumbles over his words a few times and thats the thing that people are hung up on american democracy is literally hanging in the balance but oh no biden messed up words so now we 're fucked the double standard is insane i ca n't even believe the reality we are living in
the dems seriously need to start getting huge majorities in congress the whole judiciary needs a huge revamp
dumb foreigner question why are your judges not required to be completely impartial i do n't understand the concept of judges who do n't use the law to guide their decisions
president jackson just outright ignored the supreme court when they rules that the cherokee nation ca n’t be removed jackson said john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the supreme court can be ignored fuck them and their corrupt power grabs they have illegally seized power on marbury v madison and have proven themselves to be a cancer on our republic
if we do n't get behind the democrats and stop this nonsense then we get what we deserve enough with the conservative bullshit stand up at election time show up vote blue across the board or live in the society you let happen with your inaction at voting time i guarantee that the fascist lovers will show up
until extreme money is forced out of politics the us will become a 2nd world nation statistics show we are on our way a billionaire class is holding the masses back america has the power constitution to address this without all the bloodshed at what point do the conservatives and liberals agree that money is the common enemy
scotus has already far exceeded their scope at least the conservative justices it ’s time to ignore them they do n’t and ca n’t enforce these rulings anyway so i say fuck em
keep that in mind when you vote and realize the next term is going to see 2 3 retirements in the scotus and what admininstration you want replacing them
the 2000 election was a pretty big power grab by scotus they stopped the recount and handed the election to bush jr subsequent recounts determined that gore won florida but it was too late by then
it ’s my understanding that it ’s unconstitutional for scotus to change control who determines the best way for laws to be enacted if that ’s the case then there ’s no requirement for biden or any agency to take notice of any directives from scotus in this matter
nobody is gon na like what it ’s going to take to save this nation from them but we are running out of time
i ’m begging ppl to vote in this election and every one after to try and save us i ’m honestly losing hope but if we stop voting things will only get worse
we ’re but a few steps away from “ under his eye ” mode
this is exactly why the gop knew they had to support trump three lifetime appointments with the power to destroy democracy for decades to come
there 's no reason to be an honest hardworking citizen anymore the social contract is broken these corporations are n't just destroying what our friends and families and have helped build for generations but they 're destroying any chance of future generations of having a life free from corporate interference yes america is stolen land but the ideals of the american constitution strove to correct the wrongs of every nation that came before it twisting the constitution into a protective shield for the wealthy destroys the entire purpose of this country in the first place
this is one of those decisions where a person can reduce all the nuance and dumb it down until they get to a truism like congress should make the laws but the complexities of the real world plus the realities of how this shifts powers to the courts and away from agencies make it abundantly clear to anyone who is even slightly informed that this is going to harm the us
and the corruption continues to spread into every nook and cranny of our society
maybe it ’s time to reconsider marbury v madison the fact the supreme court has supreme judicial review to begin with is only based on a norm nothing else at the time it was considered a fair compromise but this supreme court reneged on that seizing power
this so much this scotus is grabbing power away from congress and the executive while saying “ but if only congress would pass a law to fix this law that they passed that we just overturned because it was only 10 years old ” “ oh and even though the text says you can wave or modify ” we think that ’s too much so congress has to pass another law before we maybe let the executive use the power that the congress gave them it ’s all a massive power grab and should be see as such
this seems like a quiet story probably the debate debacle is overshadowing it i mean the courts in some ways have caused a lot of corruption like citizens united qualified immunity this court seemed chomping at the bit to deregulate
time to shut scotus right the fuck down impeach 6 of the trump loving shroom sucking gop fucking wankmaggots thank you for attending today 's ted talk
so the next time o get pulled over for speeding i can promise the cop a “ gratuity ”
whelp time to pack the court
it ’s the plessy court robert ’s is running a clown show we ’ll just have to claw our way back to the days before these idiots
when are we eating the mother fuckers i 'm getting hungrier by the minute
to illustrate how stupid lifetime appointments are imagine if some crazy person knocked off the six conservative justices tomorrow biden could appoint six 35 year old liberal justices and the court would be set for the next 50 years how is that not insane in a democratic republic the founders really fucked up on that one
they want the power of adjudicating every little fucking thing when it comes to executive agencies but its clear they do n't have the time or personnel to do it expand the supreme court to 30 justices at least
i really hope congress expands the court after the elections aside from the republican packing during trumps era the fact that just 9 people have so much power is ridiculous and term limited too i 'm cool with long terms 10 20 years but after a while they should have to face reappointment and justify the choices they make to the american people
venting here i already was n't going to have kids but i 'm personally struggling with seeing the point my motivation to work and save money is for the hope i can live comfortably in my twilight years but what 's the point i suppose we vote do what we can to educate people and just hope it 's enough or feel comfort in the fact we tried as this ship sinks i know this is the day it 's happening and emotions are going to be high but damn this all sucks
do conservatives not realize that by eroding all these settled laws that they do n’t like that the foundation of the settled laws that they do like are also extremely weakened like cases that support and strengthen the 2nd amendment and support churches are now going to be much much easier to change on a whim how do they not see this as an obvious bad thing for their own values and freedoms it blows my mind that anyone supports this
how difficult will this be to undo with a future scotus decision what ’s the process involved is there a process
our collective goose is cooked 4th reich is coming down fast and hard
scotus uses their judgements based on their political religious and how much monetary gifts they can get
this is the kind of ruling that actually warrants the executive ignoring it as scotus has no right to make such a ruling however it ’s unlikely that ’ll happen
the scotus fucks no longer hold any weight with me they ’re all in it to keep power for them and their friends it ’s an illegitimate court now
thnks for not retiring rbg
if only we had a functioning legislative branch to balance the supreme court 's power a united congress can change the constitution and controls the nation 's purse congress has been broken for 30 years thanks newt
not sure we can count on dems to stop this corruption dems think its 1992 lgbtq healthcare guns not even realizing that a cabal of wealthy people from around the world have billions invested in project 2025 and electing republicans to make it happen dems sat on the floor along with vp biden on 1 27 10 when president obama called out to put forth legislation to end citizens united they did nothing but collect money and make believe they love america and they want to talk lgbtq abortion and trump lol
citizens united paved the way it ’s been downhill since
great timing while everyone is distracted
what an utter shame nrdc has done such great work for this country when it comes to environmental protection issues
we need to unionize and strike like france they do n't fuck around
if you ca n't win the battle of ideas through the population and the popular vote hence laws via congress buy the supreme court to legislate instead
bullshit how about when they gave bush 2 the presidency it was all part of the plan
people are worried about project 2025 and rightfully so but i 'm not super convinced it really matters at this point with the courts stacked with federalist society stooges they can dismantle the administrative state no matter who 's in control of the executive and that was the plan all along a gop president can speed up the process but i think at this point it 's inevitable either way without some kind of drastic measure like expanding the courts
god damn nbsp so political bribery is now totally legal as long as it 's paid to the politician after they do the thing they were bribed to do nbsp and the ftc fda sec epa etc have no regulatory authority it has all been transferred to the judicial branch nbsp what the actual fuck these whackjob activist judges need to be replaced
iaal glad to see this getting the attention it deserves this is a huge blow to our modern regulatory state an intentional crippling of the government 's ability to oversee private enterprise in layman 's terms what it means is this the court rightly held long ago that agencies get the first pass at deciding undefined terms in law no dumping of harmful substances in waterways the scientists at the epa will define harmful and the courts will defer to them unless they 're obviously wrong because the scientists are the experts and that makes sense no more now the courts get a first pass at deciding what harmful means rather than dozens of scientists with cumulative centuries of experience the court will hear what might be fifteen minutes of testimony from an agency scientist and a well paid corporate shill then make up their own mind beyond making no fucking sense whatsoever this decision accretes tremendous power to the courts while making them obvious targets for corruption which they 'd definitely never partake in
on r conservative they talk about this like the win the lottery
ya but let ’s keep complaining about biden being old i swear left wing media is going to get trump elected again
so be prepared for food poisoning outbreaks rivers catching fire from sunlight like the 1950 's chemicals planes falling out of the skies more than current clusterfuck spikes in cancer from hazardous products and on and on
thanks to everyone who could n’t just hold their nose and vote for hillary
did n’t trump say he wanted to end taxes on tips makes sense now
fire them all start over
that 's what we get for not voting jokes on us idiots apathy by the left is the death of our country time to turn into dystopian hell
am i the only one who thinks they are going to grant trump immunity
what can we do it feels so hopeless
there 's going to be a revolution is n't there
man tipping culture is out of control smh
there has to be a point where we stop accepting this court ’s legitimacy
during the industrial revolution the focus of corporations began to shift towards profitability which led to a gradual departure from the earlier emphasis on serving the public good historically businesses were expected to contribute to societal welfare as a condition for their operation the term “ common law ” refers to legal principles derived from judicial decisions this body of law influenced business practices by establishing precedents that companies needed to follow in today ’s times the proliferation of corporations has sparked debate about their role in society while many argue that most corporations do not directly serve the public interest nonetheless they have become more powerful than the government and essentially own politicians and supreme court judges on both sides this is n’t a dem vs republican thing this is a rich vs poor issue that will never change until we force corporations to provide a social good again
interestingly republicans were initially in favor of chevron in the 1980s the courts were stacked in liberals ' favor and reagan was having trouble using his epa to slash rather than strengthen environmental regulations the left leaning courts would smack them down chevron was a victory for the reagan admin because it now meant his epa would more or less have final say and the courts could fuck off but in the intervening decades conservatives locked down control of the courts so they no longer had any need for chevron so they just drop kicked it to the curb they now have more enduring control over agency regulations this means that samuel alito will be deciding whether you can have clean drinking water or vaccines a reminder that if 2016 had gone the other way we would likely have a 5 4 liberal majority just keep that in mind when you 're deciding what to do in november
or maybe congress can actually write and pass some laws the way it is supposed to be
remember when the democrats had 8 years to enforce repercussions for the mortgage meltdown and did nothing this is not a surprise attack this is the result of a long litany of decisions that were not based on sound planning these decisions caused the slide to the right
when are we gon na stop letting 9 people rule the country with no way to recall them
this is the bright line that can not be crossed the only answer is to vote in november get everything at the fed level under d control and install 4 to 6 more justices if you thought citizens united was bad this case just told you to hold its beer citizens united literally paved the way for fascism this ruling has established that scotus is now the highest branch of government and we will no longer be in a democracy if the other branches follow this ruling
my family has a home in the caribbean i ’m seriously considering uprooting my life and starting over from scratch over there because fuck this court
yeah so they basically have made 9 people with lifetime appointment the most powerful people in the country and given no real way to challenge that the only way for any change is literally for 6 people to die and that is a really messed up system sooner or later an increasingly desperate people are going to decide to speed up the process as it is their only option
the usa is going to dissolve pretty quickly if this is the case at the rate things are going no fucking way the usa makes it out of the 21st century best case scenario we see large blocs of states going their own way in some form of cold civil war
they also ruled against regulatory agencies making their own regulations
america as a concept is in what is known as managed decline decades of growth it 's time to harvest the writing is on the wall just look at demographic collapse the world over endless growth was only possible if the population kept growing new consumers coming online year after year was more wallets to pump more tax dollars to fleece well we already know how many 30 and 40 year olds we will have in 10 15 years because they are 20 and 30 years old now it 's not a problem of not enough kids it 's not enough kids 20 years ago it 's already too late from 2020 to 2030 is the decade where the boomers will retire and there are not enough millennials to replace them a shift from mostly producers to mostly consumers who have already done most of their lifetimes biggest economic activity homes cars education and a shift from active investments to securities as they move into retirement spending america alone will be hurt a little because we have more in that bracket but other places around the world are going to be devastated and it 's going to get bad in many ways i am grossly paraphrasing peter zeihan here but demographics is just one metric there are others see his work if you want farther reading
genuine question if scotus is overreaching by making decisions they do n't legally have the authority to make because those powers reside in the other branches of government then are n't their decisions legally void for all practical purposes why are n't people just straight up ignoring them it 's as if the health inspector started telling restaurants how to season or plate their food not because there was some sort of health hazard just because they personally preferred it that way cool opinion but i do n't think i 'm going to listen to it the us should put together a grassroot organization of impartial legal experts that examine scotus decisions for their legality and broadcast to the people which ones are safe to ignore because they are illegal overreaches
this is where i 'm thankful i 'm in ca this state could literally run by itself and be just fine 4 5th largest economy in the world we have all the wine all the tech all the food a port and some of the best tourist spots in the world i 'd love to make those assholes in tx have to get a visa to come here
chevron and citizens united the bell tolls for our democracy all power is now vested in corporations and the supreme court
2 3 generations of lawyers were taught chevron in law school the rule was as settled as any in the curriculum it was cement immutable you could have the most conservative law professor in the nation they ’d be teaching you chevron and all the while they ’d be thinking the rule made perfect sense it is an earth shattering development to see it now overturned like overturning brown vs board level earth shattering maybe beyond that even you are right to say this is the story of the year
anyone want to guess how this decision is going to affect govt attempts to regulate ai projects under elon musk and peter thiel in the next decade
but did you hear biden had one bad night so he should step down so trump can nominate the next two soctus judges
i have issues with the outrage and lack of a plan forward this seems like something reasonably easy to fix “ in the event that a law is insufficiently clear to reasonable enforcement the overall intent and purpose of the legislation we congress authorized administrative agencies to derive rules based on their subject matter expertise we further officially adopt and codify all previously existing and active administrative rules in place prior to june 28 2024 ” the issue is congress is n’t making laws and the administrative state is having to fill in so are the courts congress likes to bemoan but they could also just do their job to fix things vote blue
this has always been biggest concern with the supreme court there are n't a lot of checks on it up to this point their commitment to upholding the law has prevented them from abusing their power but now it seems that is out the window
this is what i 've been trying to tell people too the court simply scuttled the executive branch 's regulatory authority with a few signatures why bother firing people
it ’s already happening slowly and discreetly since reagan each republican president has idealized many of the objectives in project 2025 they just were n’t so blatant and comprehensive until project 2025 was published edit spelling
still better than project 2025 with the orange felon i do n't know if things are in a state where a reasonable recovery will be possible but i sure as hell do know that trump will make things worse
he could have a coronary tomorrow and the fascists would pick another idiot to lead them
the people who just decided money given to a public official to reward them for giving millions in government contracts is n't a bribe but simply a gratuity who have fought against any actual ethics rules to ban them receiving bribes oops i mean gratuities gifts have now blown up a regulatory system in order to allow companies to have their approvals or grievances go more directly to the courts where at the top of the food chain they can gobble gobble gobble some of that sweet corporate interest money
france was once also run by some of the most richest corrupt and incompetent rulers in the world and that all changed because of some unpredictable weather that led to crop failures we already have political and economic instability present throughout society i believe it ’s only a matter of time until something similar again happens in the us that moment will be the most opportune time for these republican hypocrites to learn that money can not buy their way out of the consequences of their actions
well on its way it has been since the early ' 00s millennials graduated high school into a dystopia and the boomers kept kicking them telling them it 's their fault things are fucked reality is that people are finally on their way to realizing they 've neglected society and government so badly that they live in a dystopian shit hole we have so many mass shootings it is n't even news anymore the economy works for 001 % of americans our healthcare system is an unaffordable shit show we 're like a shitty narcissist that beats his dog chugs booze smokes meth who loves to brandish our gun and is dying of an easily preventable and treatable condition i thought four years of trump would be a fitting punishment for the society neo liberals created turns out there 's a large enough portion of americans so ignorant so arrogant and so petty they pine for four more years of douchebag
america could do what france does and fill the streets demanding their resignation
oh it 's already there if you 're poor
all because 8 years ago people accused the democratic candidate of being a “ corporate shill ” and a “ warmonger ” and “ just as bad as trump ” so they tried to “ send a message to the dnc ” by not voting thankfully the left would never make a mistake like that again
makes you wonder if people would have just tolerated hilary how the country would have looked today
hamstrung and locked up by lawyers
we ’ll that ’s because we the people have n’t or are n’t doing shit about it at the moment we fought for our independence from england we fought for the freedom of slaves we fought for workers rights we fought against fascism we fought for civil rights and now we sit on our phones and complain on the internet we need to stop talking on the internet and gather in person to come up with a real plan and real strategies were gon na have to fight and sacrifice to have a better life for us and our children just like our ancestors
i 'm ready to get in the streets the power of the people is stronger than the people in power they 've forgotten who they work for
it would be extremely unfortunate if
the true path to authoritarianism lies in the courts
thank you for posting op i keep checking to see how people feel about the supreme court and people still talking about the damn debate
it ’s being overshadowed because people do n’t understand how important the administrative state
the president should enforce constitutional law and lock up the entire fucking supreme court god knows these clowns fucking are n’t doing it
really why is this not already being done i do n’t understand
bring back riding the circuit
better solution is to not provide secruity details for the justices that approved this corruption as trump said maybe the 2nd admendment people can do something
you ’re saying i ’m supposed to believe a so called “ expert ” hired by the government that tells me lead in my bottled water is bad instead of the judge that says he has been using lead pencils his whole life and is just fine and is also going to get a nice gratuity in a few weeks from his patron at the deer park lead company
just a little pollution never hurt anyone sure some of you will get cancer and die but that 's a risk that they 're willing to take
how much more are they going to charge us for adding the lead
is n’t that currently legal it ’s legal to cut cinnamon with lead because it ’s cheaper california is the only state that tracks lead in food nobody else cares enough lunchables have 78 % of your daily lead intake
someone needs to put lead in the supreme court
the founders would not have seen that coming
that makes it sound positive it will be a second exponentially bloodier civil war that could last a generation
americans wo n’t have a revolution all this talk about why they ’re so armed and have the highest gun per person rate in the world and literally let the country get to the state it ’s in now by poor incredibly poor leadership if they did nothing then and now the status quo wo n’t change
nah we just have n’t voted hard enough
honestly am wondering when the hell this is going to happen because i ’m sick of this shit like a civil war is bound to happen in the near future if the wrong person is voted into power and the supreme court just keeps getting shittier
the vast majority of citizens under 45 will not spend a couple hours every two years to vote there is absolutely zero chance people are going to risk their jobs let alone their lives on some revolt
it ’s kind of haunting i remember looking at the chart of the checks and balances in my civics class and thinking “ huh it does n’t really seem like there ’s anyway to hold the supreme court to account ” and then this shit happens
civics is no longer taught in most american high schools so there 's that
sure they will check your balance to see if you have enough to pay the court
lol at thinking they still teach civics
oh do n't forget it 's now judges who will be making these calls about whether companies are following ill defined regulations and with all the conservative judges enjoying lifelong tenure honestly it 's hard to properly state how utterly devastating this will be and the irony is all the fools in r conservative rejoicing about this the number of them who own companies who will benefit financially from this vs the number of them who will suffer from the fallout from it well let 's just say there are a lot more of them in the second category that they know they 'll find out unfortunately when their air chokes them and their water poisons them but hey they 're happy for now
carbon dioxide is n't listed in the original clean air act it 's been up to the epa to identify new issues and create regulations around it this ruling completely neuters enforcement because co2 is n't in the original law if any court just felt like it how many tens of thousands of things like this will there be it 's unimaginable and completely designed to cripple agencies with lawsuits good luck sec fighting every bank at once i 'm sure the republicans will make sure they 're well funded and have the proper resources to do their job
they need to ignore the court and hold it accountable
actually in the event of project 2025 this might be a blessing but they did not kneecap congress congress can literally explicitly pass a law to override this interpretation and directly authorize administrative agencies to make rules or just blanket adopt rules the issue is congress due to gop is not doing shit
the wealthy keep their money nope it was about installing a dictatorship some of those wealthy will have their money and businesses taken as well
the double standard here is insane one bad debate and democrats are finished 30 criminal convictions are totally cool though
you do realize that their published decision timing window friday post debate is very deliberately to tuck the impact under the rug for the weekend
that was probably their intent time the decision so the debate buries it in the news cycle
this is why people insisted you vote in 2016 and earlier regardless it ’s too late now
dems should pivot to the number of court nominations they expect to see in the next four years it 's definitely motivate people that come out and vote for an old man if they feel there 's up to 3 possible seats in the next four years
the number of rulings coming down during debate week is insane and they know what they ’re doing
wait til we get to the main course pfas microplastics and climate change
40 years of laws have been written with this doctrine in mind the government can not function now that 's the point
this is basically the entire philosophy around how agencies like the fda operate regulations are written as high level as possible to cover for all potential risks in whatever product they are regulating without chevron deference regulations will have to be written for each specific product and each specific situation and each one could be easily shot down by the courts when the company who owns it sues there ’s no way in hell they ’ll be able to operate like this
everyone should be furious about this
and obama was shunned for calling them out on this bullshit in his sotu
yeah they have doomed us
everyone dying is bad for business ferengi rule of acquisition 410
they 're too dumb to give a fuck
fuck that there should be 400 justices each case randomly selects 5 let 's see harlan crow buy a yacht big enough to fit 400 justices
i agree he should have been pushing for it but it would nt happen without a sizable house majority and a filibuster proof senate majority neither of which he has had
democrats in congress have put out bills trying to increase the number of justices as well as a barrage of reform bills but they keep languishing in the judiciary committee which has a republican majority and is headed by jim jordan they ca n't do it without a majority in congress people need to vote and vote all the way down the ballot
i saw biden 's election as a stay of execution american democracy is still on death row we just got a temporary reprieve
jesus christ was that depressing to read but you 're absolutly spot on
it will take the democrats willing to fight for it and follow through remember they are making millions off this political cancer they refuse to fix it and very few are calling them out on it
it ’s funny how scripted media is so focused on dystopian futures recently maybe it ’s to distract from the dystopian present we are living in without knowing it our once great empire has fallen and is now firmly under the control of the plutocrats
i honestly think trump dying will break the back of this movement nobody has his charisma and can fire up the rubbs like he can any future republicans will have the same issues as the past having to appeal to the rubbs but having their real base of support being the ultra rich trump is so dangerous because he has the undying support of all the rubbs because of his charisma and then has sold his soul to the ultra wealthy it has made him particularly dangerous
guarantee every challenge to regulations will be done to get it in front of the 5th circuit then the sc can shoot down any higher appeal and leave it to those zealots
reigned in reined in it 's a horse metaphor
they ’re trying their very hardest to make people fight each other more and since the people wo n’t now they ’re getting more aggressive about it they really need that much of a distraction
i honestly think it 's the worst decision since plessy vs ferguson
how long til aileen cannon is asked to decide how to enforce laws concerning say cryptocurrencies ai fracking in national parks no worries though she 's an expert in all of those areas i 'm sure
i think the vast majority of americans would support declaring this court 's rulings invalid we pretty much all agree they 've gone too far and need to be removed
he has made his decision now let him enforce it
ca n’t exactly ignore lead in your water due to deregulation
the death of an empire
because our monkey brains pick up on social things far more than rational objective facts
absolutely not a dumb question and plenty of americans are asking the same question we desperately need an expanded court and term limits for scotus
because there 's literally nothing to keep these people in check outside of the threat of impeachment and removal which requires a 2 3rds majority in congress because some dinguses in white wigs 200 years ago believed that was good enough to write onto a piece of parchment with a constitution that 's centuries too old and a government that 's been divided literally in half for the last 40 years shit 's proper fucked
there is n’t really any mechanism to hold the supreme court truly responsible for anything they ’re supposed to be the highest impartial court in the land justices are supposed to recuse themselves from cases if there s a conflict of interest but they do n’t the senate is supposed to handle judge appointments from the president but that was heavily manipulated by mcconnel to block an obama pick and rush through a trump pick it ’s corrupt as hell but it ’s all “ above board ” so to speak the entire structure of our government is riddled with massive flaws like this because it is designed to work with people who are n’t abusing the power it gives them
they are n’t required to be completely impartial they are supposed to recuse when they have an interest that would give the appearance of bias that said it ’s made up nonsense that the conservatives have been pushing that liberal justices are activists ’ and they just go by the letter of the law that ’s obviously hogwash because it ’s not possible to have a lack of an ideology or value system strictly interpreting every law is in itself an ideology an insane one too might i add at no point when we draft laws do we intend them to be exactly specific they obviously are written to enact a broad goal or general purpose
because a complete impartial person does n't exist that 's not a thing that exists in the entire world
2nd world nation the us will become an ex soviet state
exactly they have no real power they control no police for nor army
all these people in this thread saying this is when us democracy died or is on death row people with longer memories remember it died then when the sc started picking the winners of elections
the biggest tragedy of that was that we lost our chance to do something about climate change when it might have still made a difference
they 're gon na try to wipe us out before the planet does i ca n't think of another reason they 'd be so blatant while still remaining public figures
louisiana has entered the chat
should 've just been one between congress not doing it 's job with obama 's nominee and the sheer hubris of rbg here we are
yes the social contract is broken when do we riot
the money behind project 2025 is the most fkn evil thing to happen to america fred trump 's support for nazis has manifested well in his son the traitor fred koch and the john birch society could not destroy democracy but maybe his son charles and the heritage foundation can this wealthy cabal needs to be stopped all us citizens involved seize all their assets and gitmo them all of them they will not stop what else are they going to do with all the wealth they have stolen from america
the french were once ruled by a small group of unelected bureaucrats maybe we should take inspiration from our oldest ally
it 's already burning well on our way to a mad max future
brother they just cooked a 40 year old scotus decision without any sweat the minute liberals get the majority it will be gone however the damage will be done because that ’s not projected to happen until 2060s
you can count on them if enough are elected to form a lasting majority and hold the presidency they are n't in a position of sufficient political strength to do what you want
if you 've been paying attention to all that then listen a little more closely democrats do n't have the power to stop this because a third of americans vote republican and another third do n't vote at all the corruption does n't end until we give democrats a 2 3 majority in the senate until then republicans will continue blocking legislation
every justice responsible for citizens united was appointed by a republican for the love of everything people please vote and vote all the way down the ballot so there 's finally enough of a democratic majority in congress to fix this mess
good thing there 's no way judges can legally take kickbacks after making a decision that benefits one of those corporations right right anybody
there is one way to challenge it but it requires a democratic trifecta with the cajones to end the filibuster the senate pass a bill to expand the supreme court restore the voting rights act expand the house ban gerrymandering pass a campaign finance law with teeth pass a new bribery law pass a binding scotus ethics bill pass a law clearly and directly allowing the executive branch to enforce regulations that congress authorizes it to or decide that an old man with a head cold is bad leader and let the incontinent convicted felon back in to lie some more
it gets better if the right corporate stooge makes it into the whitehouse in a few months two will immediately retire and be replaced by 35 year olds the court will be an almost certain conservative lock for the vast majority of our lifetimes
every single american is a trip to a specific kind of store away from challenging the sc at this point there 's a duty to riot against those fascists
9 justices on the court is a convention not a legal limit given a determined enough potus with a senate majority to approve the nomination there 's nothing preventing extra 6 appointments to push the total number to 15
given no real way to challenge that i would like to see those 2a nuts do something about it hint they ca n't
i am becoming more radical with every bad decision that abandons established precedence
i mean is n't this why americans have guns in their constitution
well if that 's the only way they 'll cede power i suppose i could never convict anyone who tried to help them out
that 's a nice supreme court ya got there be a shame if sumthin was ta happen ta it
the only way for any change is literally for 6 people to die so a well armed citizens or militia can help in this case
we 're essentially already in a cold civil war i think balkanization with light to moderate domestic terrorism is the best we can hope for tbh
i m glad i m leaving no children in the future climate changed hellscape
cali oregon and washington would probably form a super country pretty damn quickly i 'd be scrambling to go there
and the supreme court is thoroughly controlled by heritage foundation morons as someone pointed out i actually meant federalist society similar institution though
judicial coup votes do n't matter in a judicial coup
it ’s been dead you ’ve just been seeing weekend at bernie ’s
thomas also does not like brown v boe
or efforts to regulate any tech at all not a chance
in an ideal world the legislature would either slap this down and write a law that recodifies chevron failing that the legislature would employ a field of experts and write rules based on their recommendations but i think you can see how that process is already more vulnerable to corruption plus we have n't even addressed how this is not an ideal world and the legislature is not going to legislate unless it absolutely has to
i 'm more worried about the epa and the nlrb
biden could be in a vegetative state and is still the better option
all modern states rely on subject matter experts in bureaucracies to interpret and create regulations based on broad legislative intent it ’s the only way to manage complex systems this literally makes the country ungovernable
abolish the court and undo their recent rulings presidents have immunity from everything right use that power biden
maybe the executive branch needs to ignore the courts i mean judicial review is n't in the constitution after all
laboratories of autocracy is a great read
bribes to judges are gratuities now and judges get to decide regulations on behalf of those who bribe them all legal thanks to the roberts court been a busy week for our 6 unelected overlords burning through decades of stare decisis precedents until the rule of law is meaningless from now on its not “ is that legal ” it ’s “ who ’s asking ”
citizens united was the turning point in american history on par with the secession of the confederacy possibly surpassing even it will be the demise of the usa as we know it
i ca n't wait for monday when scotus declares that trump as president had complete immunity this will mean that biden has complete immunity fuck trump lock him up lock up half of scotus lock up the republican party scotus is so fucking stupid
i 'm fairly confident their gratuity decision does n't apply to federal employees that was state and local officials anything chevron would be a federal matter that being said this is all so fucked
alito and thomas are just making sure they ’ll get ample gratuities when they step down during trump ’s 2nd term
horrible i say we boycott anything that ’s not essential fancy clothes jewelry nikes etc fuck that court
let 's be clear all 9 justices opposed the ethics rules they 're all corrupt
history may not repeat itself exactly but damn if it does n't rhyme do you hear the people sing singing the song of angry men it is the music of the people who will not be slaves again when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes
well the rub here is that the french had to deal with some pikemen and guards whereas today you have the mq 9 reaper that will vaporize you from low orbit right after they make anyone trying to revolt out to be domestic terrorists through a thoroughly owned media this shit is chess now it ai n't checkers
the problem back then is the people knew who to blame if that happened today half the country would attack the weathermen who predicted the storm
it took france several decades to become stable again republicanism in france has proven fragile the first french republic ended with napoleon followed by the bourbon restoration the second republic ended with napoleon iii the third ended with hitler
one of two ways 1 russia loses in ukraine and all the republican connections and kompromat leak out 2 global warming keeps on keeping on republicans do n't believe in climate change but their states are some of the most impacted florida is like 2 natural disasters away from economic collapse because insurers refuse to do business in florida because of climate change
' trump 's presidency yeah i liked how so many people died and we were spiralling into chaos by the end of the first term i really wanted that back y'know i enjoyed how he managed to make every situation worse and worse through constant mismanagement i liked living in a disaster movie made my retirement very entertaining '
i saw this point somewhere else the people who got trump elected are not really the rank and file those people are the coordinated distraction the people who matter are the republican elites the ones who fight to get people into lower courts who map out org charts who show up for elections to minor official roles the people who create and fund teams of lawyers analysts consultants and media managers its like these are the people who manage the message who spent the time and had the burning motivation to tear systems down by studying and exploiting every weakness they could figure out to gridlock government to make legislation ineffective to throw up barriers at every step of the way this is n’t the work of the voters that show up on tv
we had the largest protests in american history in 2012 and they did absolutely nothing i do remember wall street people pouring wine on top of the protesters and laughing though
they will be labeled riots and the police will be happy to shut them down as long as their checks clear
lol this is america silly some stern tweets and cross words on the youtube channel is how don’t actually get anything done
has been for a while too
i mean and it was hilary we all know just how awful hillary used to be trump vs hillary trump obviously s
i do n’t wonder i know for one thing the united states would n’t have extremist partisan judges on the court
no do n’t stop so anyway
at what point do we ignore them entirely
so much this it literally does not matter what we do the gop has the supreme court in its pocket trying to replace biden in july is a waste of time i do nt want him to be the answer i do n't want trump to win we have to go all or nothing on biden
can we just do it now if the california government today called the supreme court a bunch of partisan hacks and said they would be ignoring any and all rulings from them i 'd be in
yup similar thing happened in 1930s germany
biden wo n't do it but we are heading towards the point where the president just needs to say he is ignoring the court 's orders constitutional crisis ca n't be anyworse than the court co opting all federal power for themselves
who would do it and how is it something that congress would need to pass if so are there enough votes for it
i 'm an environmental chemist you just described my experience when i tell conservatives what i do for a living
the funny thing is pencils are graphite so the judge does n't even have that part right
dude what the fuck are you serious
now the courts get to decide if the fdas daily lead intake number is used or not kraft heinz could just bribe them to triple it for reasons
i know they explicitly gave the court no power the constitutional review was originally under the responsibility of the president thus why they have the veto which was intended to be used only when the law proposed was against the constitution
founders thought the battle was going to be between the three branches hence the separation of powers
my boy tj was on it “ you seem to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions a very dangerous doctrine indeed and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy our judges are as honest as other men and not more so they have with others the same passions for party for power and the privilege of their corps their power the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible as the other functionaries are to the elective control ”
the founders did n't intend scotus to be the final arbiters of constitutionality judicial review is n't in the constitution at all
imagine 18th c people being neither omniscient nor infallible
i know i 'm looking forward to the american troubles what if everyone had guns
it wo n’t even happen what makes you think the public would ever step up i have n’t seen anything to suggest any of us would there ’s a doc on netflix where people from germany talking about their time leading up during and after the war what it was like for them living in germany the biggest thing that stuck out was one old guy talking about seeing his grocer and friend being out on a train along with many others and the whole town was gathered watching he was wondering about why no one was stopping this or standing up he realized there are a lot less “ heroes ” out there than anyone would want to believe
in high school i remember a student asking “ so if a scj breaks the law are they still on the bench for life ” the teacher assured her if that happened congress would impeach them
the executive branch does n’t have to enforce scotus decisions
those people do n’t understand until it personally affects them
it is far worse than that the entire economy is going to get fucked i wonder how the private sector is going to deal with a fed whose regulatory authority and independence gets fucked what about all the companies that provide services to the federal government how about all the companies that have their entire ongoing production lines and billions spent on r d in a regulatory environment suddenly made obsolete any company that relies on a stable federal government is about to get fucked
they need to dissolve the supreme court there is nothing left to salvage
congress does n't like legislating the details they have been handing more and more power to the executive branch because they do not have the capacity capability or interest in writing the minute details congress would rather write a law that says we want you to generally do xyz for a reasons and you figure out how to carry out our will they not want to waste time writing a law that says do x1 x1 a x1 b x2 a 1 x2 a 2 xn n n yn n n zn n n because we say so
guess we just wait for a non deadlocked non republican controlled congress i think that 's happened once or twice in my entire life
por que no los dos
i sincerely disagree a dictatorship can come after the courts too that 's what unchecked power is this is about weakening powers of the government fo the benefit of corporate america
it ’s definitely feeling like a concerted effort by the media to keep this race close for clicks with a barrage of self fulfilling prophecy if necessary
yes i do think most americans are idiots so pardon me if i think a bunch of idiots care more about biden 's age than trump 's convictions sorry convince me that most people are smart and i 'll stop worrying
well always works in favor of the populists extremists and the last democratic superpower on this planet is facing off against the quite possibly strongest american populist ever with a cult following on top of that the populist probably gets behind closed doors support from russia and china for his misinformation machine
the faa too they write new critical rules all the time airworthiness directives when safety issues arise these rules are the law of the land airlines ca n't violate them or face stiff financial penalties or even criminal prosecution so now the faa ca n't do this because that 's only a power that congress has
can the courts even operate like that if every product and every situation has to go through court how long is the case queue going to be serious risk of r maliciouscompliance here oh i could n't possibly have an opinion on judge said i ' have no special competence ' so i 'm sending to court for them to handle
how does that work when the fda is 80 years older then the chevron case more of it 's existence predates the case then after it
i think that 's uncharitable to a lot of democrats many democrats from congressmen to supreme court justices to biden have called out the worst excesses the problem is there is n't an easy legal path to fix it we ca n't pass laws due to an obstructionist congress and even if we did the sc would shoot them down as unconstitutional before you suggest ignoring the courts this in effect amount to suggesting we ignore the law to keep the law it does n't work the fact is it is easier to break something than repair it republicans want the government broke and while i think most dems want it repaired or at least functioning it takes time and cooperation to do that accusing dems of not fighting hard enough to defeat republican fascism is like blaming the cancer patient for not fighting hard enough since they feed the cancer by eating or something it 's republicans full stop
or it 's because it 's the only thing people find relateable any more dystopian futures in media usually present a glimpse of hope that is lacking in reality
i ’m worried about a coalition of the worst kinds of influencers grifters keeping it alive i have no doubt the dude bro conspiracy alpha types will hype up whoever heritage decides to back for no more than a check no integrity in who they support as long as it drives up their audience trump dying gives them an opportunity to back a new one in the trump mold that they can have already started concocting now idk if they picked trump or if they just dug in with him once he surprised us and won i think my main counterpoint is not to overestimate the intelligence of those folks who get so fired up about trump not that i ’m arguing you hit their mo on the head reagan w trump all bought by wealthy and loved by the poor but they can do it again just might take 8 12 years
this is what conservatives fail to realize shit like this does n't just own the libs it will kill them too you like to roll coal and think communism telling corporations they have to pay tiny fines if they spill toxic chemicals well the aquifer you do n't care about polluting does n't give a fuck about who you voted for you will be getting liver cancer your kids will be the ones with birth defects pollution does n't discriminate it harms everyone
no no we really need to vote
the dingus 's in the wigs also had the idea and opinion that the constitution should be rewritten every generation but unfortunately did n't put that into it
who would even be the arbiter of what constitutes an impartial decision
agree modern russia is a second world state and it will never make it to first world level until putin is gone at a minimum feels like the supreme court is our putin right now
i keep saying this and people think i 'm crazy
whenever people get out and organized if you want protests about this spread the word like wildfire and make sure to keep people riled up
i saw someone on here refer to that as the french solution to corrupt politicians and the ultra wealthy
but what about his emails for real this could 've all prevented in 2016 if americans had made the right choice some of them even said what 's the worse that could happen and look where we are today
thanks for spelling it out but in doing so you ’ve clarified that it will never happen so that ’s too bad
the real problem now is the sc is just using any technicality they can to gut rules that are not backed by law explicitly most rational people understand that some things are in an agency 's scope but the sc is essentially saying if it is not verbatim law by congress they do n't have the authority we need to win congress and get all of these stupid technicalities in writing from congress but also expand the court and then those justices rule on it because you know gop justices do n't excuse themselves when involved
it already is currently a very conservative sc and will be unless the sc is expanded but as you said it can be made even more so
my brother did a role playing game in hs for a holocaust history class that demonstrated the rise of fascism the facist won the teacher ran this game for multiple years the facist won a lot
hmmm does that duty apply to everyone
can we be your baja california
it 's really insane to think about how much better my life would be in a world where cascadia existed lmao
those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable jfk
yeah a lot of people vs a lot of empty land
yeah we 've been in a cold civil war ever since the hot civil war and even before that it was a cold war between the federalists and the anti federalists the anti federalists have won the obstructionism under obama and stacking of the courts under trump was the final move project 2025 can accelerate their plans but they can still achieve them through the courts without it
i would n't call the heritage foundation or federalist society morons evil absolutely this shit has been planned out for a long time morons ca n't execute plans january 6th insurrectionists are morons
a field of experts will just be lobbyists which is sooo good for democracy good luck getting congress to agree on prescribing specific language and then to make frequent updates over time
legislature would either slap this down and write a law that recodifies chevron and it would be rules unconditional by scotus because some philosophical bullshit from the 1200s says you ca n't overrule the divine council of elders i mean scotus
i 'm more conservative leaning but if you ask me it does n't matter if he 's in a vegetative state or not it 's the administration and their ideas that matter most you vote on the notion and spirit of someone who is a good decent human being trump ai n't a good human being this is why he was n't re elected the last time it 's really not that hard to understand i know many americans are dumb but hopefully not that dumb
hw could be dead and still be the better option
this literally makes the country ungovernable yeah that seems to be the point with every decision this extreme court is making they are taking a flame thrower to this country and every bit of progress we 've made since roosevelt their paymasters want this country to be ungovernable by the government but governable by the billionaire class
it does not make the country ungovernable it makes the government unable to govern these are very different things there are parties more than willing to rule you in the absence of a government capable of stopping them
exactly it ’s what some states will start to do once they figure out the most corrupt scotus of the modern era is n’t worth listening to
well people tip their barista i do n't see why they should n't tip their judges clarence thomas probably
who on the fucking planet has ever tipped a judge they 're not servers
all of the founding fathers are rolling in their graves faster than the speed of light it ’s not even who ’s talking but more like “ how much we talking ”
instead of “ who ’s asking ” you should replace it with darth sidious saying”i’ll make it legal ”
i 'd say surpassing purely because cu actually worked
i 'd back up even further to bush v gore if the fl count had finished gore would have eeked out a win then no invasion of iraq no appointing roberts to the court no citizens united
you mean see how they manage to write something that gives trump and only trump immunity
why settle for just locking people up with total immunity you can make your wildest dreams reality with no legal consequences for your actions
as much as i 'd love to see that happen it ca n't in my wildest dreams i never could have imagined that a conman that had an excellent amount of money to begin with could run every single business into the ground we 're talking about the same guy causing a constitutional crisis dudes such a fuckup he 's taking the usa down impossible not without his friends on the wrong side of the axis
this will mean that biden has complete immunity you forget one of their greatest hits the this ruling is not precedent decisions
at this point i 'm half expecting them to just straight up rule that only republican presidents have immunity it 's not like anyone can do anything about it
then biden needs to go nuclear appoint 4 new justices fire the idiots like powell and dejoy and give the next four years to gavin newsom
if biden dems were n't complete pussies he would order seal team 6 to go sit on the benches outside the supreme court in full gear on monday just sit there just hanging out chillin
except dems wo n’t they will claim the moral center while republicans exploit their new power if trump gets immunity that ’s a huge chess piece falling in place for him he might even be able to pack the court and add more justices who can twist all laws in any way that trump wants we ’re on the biff tannen wins timeline
that 's just the first step the next step is for someone to bribe a federal official and get convicted for it it 'll be appealed to the supreme court and the court will say oh my gosh look at all this precedent that we created so conveniently i guess it 's ok for federal officials to take bribes too
anything chevron would be a federal matter it 's not really that simple any state court decision that provided analogous power to the state executive regulatory authorities by citing chevron would also now be subject to challenges in state court now hopefully state courts are a bit more reasonable and find some independent means to allow their government to function but it 's hard to overstate just how much chaos there will be in the courts for the next few years
if trump is reelected of course they will step down so he can put 30 year olds in there if biden wins they will hang in there another four years
is it still a boycott when people just stop being able to afford it anymore
sure that ’s a really good point but a increasingly likely scenario in which crop failures become severe in the u s is likely happening in other parts of the world too i do n’t think military action will be prioritized in the mainland during such a tumultuous period in human history where other countries will become desperate to enforce their food security needs beyond their borders consider the positions india and china are in things are going to get ugly around the world but during that chaos there will be another opportunity for ordinary people to repeat history utilizing modern equipment too it wo n’t be completely one sided
yea the police force is beyond militarized as well between the cops and the actual military the people do n’t stand much of a chance of rebellion in the usa they ’d just use a few drones and the militia would be done all the ar15s would n’t stand a chance against that
true but if pawns randomly disregard the rules and begin moving erratically the game ca n't really be called chess anymore
listen if some overweight maga 's could storm the capital so could any other group
lol ca n’t argue against that that is a good point to bring up though you can not deny that we also have a huge number of educated people coinciding with them they are n’t bourgeois this time either
the people knew who to blame well not really the result was “ the terrors ” following the revolution where anyone could end up accused and executed unfortunately with social media and the current state of division we would likely see results that make the terrors look like a kindergarten field trip jacques cazotte predicted the terror and got the guillotine within a month looks like your point about the weatherman is historically accurate
russia does n't even need to bribe republicans russian oligarchs are the role models of republicans they privatized things to the extent reagan would spontaneously nut himself and are like dweebs sucking up to the cool kid they want to emulate
people flooded into fl in search of their own slice of a maga dystopia there is a significant vocal minority of americans that yearn to fuck over everyone around them for their own pleasure
they did n't exactly do nothing they prompted the elites to flood the mainstream media with race baiting content to pit different coloured people against each other and distract from the 1 % all this identity politics shit started shortly after occupy
biggest protests so far the biggest protest in american history was in 2017 the women 's march after trump took office 2nd is 1970s earth day 3rd and 4th also under trump
whenever the protests get sufficiently large they use the excuse of some random person in a crowd throwing a water bottle or something to declare the whole assembly unlawful and call a curfew on the protest as if the first amendment has a bedtime the right to protest has essentially been neutered in the us
i 'm there honestly i 'm there i want the next democrat president to stack the court they can bend the rules to the breaking point with that bullshit with garland we can stack the court it 's legal so let 's do it and you know what we 're eventually going to get there the more they get their way the more the country sees that their way is fucking awful there 's a snap back coming and it 's going to be big it may take a few years but it 's coming
this is the most important election in us history if trump wins and gets congress he will be the most powerful person in human history with control of all three branches of government
the system should not be so weak that one person making a mistake can doom us all or why do republicans america we may never know
i ’m leaning towards view as well my understanding is that the constitution gives no power to the sc to enforce only to confer and give opinion someone correct me
exactly the appropriate response is “ no come and make me ” they have no power to enforce the law or force the president and his her command of the military to do what they ask
they 're only graphite now because of regulation
what if everyone distrusted the news
throughout history it seems the bad people have far more energy and determination than the good people the bad are typically angry greedy and filled with rage they harness that rage come together and fight for what it is they want whereas the good or normal people just want a peaceful simple existence they have no interest in fighting they 'll sacrifice comfort hoping their adversaries will be content consequently it takes a lot of crap to get them angry and motivated to the point that they actively fight back often it 's too late and they submit to their fate i see the republicans as the first group with the second group being the democrats
the difference is america is fucking massive the west coast and northeast coast it 's 20x bigger than germany even back then people on the west coast are n't going to just be okay with people thousands of miles away saying ok republican dictatorship time because the west coast is heavily left leaning they 'd be pretty quickly saying fuck no
guess they did n't think half of our politicians would be in bed with russian oligarchs trying to destabilize our country enough for it to come apart at the seams and fail
even then they will actively refuse to understand it
and then they 'll blame democrats
we do need it for checks and balances purposes it just is n't serving that purpose right now so dissolve and rebuild but yeah they said it 's okay for them to get bribes just that alone they 've got ta go that 's just insane open corruption that 's not even partisan none of us want that
for clarity the reason they do that is because that ’s the inky way anythingll get done we see the gridlock on just agreeing on finding and goals imagine if legislation had to designate governmental agencies ’s official policy and criteria as well you would increase the length of legislation by 10x and nothing would get passed as people argue on small points forever
could n’t agree more shame on cnn and anderson cooper baiting harris with weasel words bunch of sellout pieces of shit money wins every time i guess
i have friends who work at finance firms and their companies are already talking about skirting around the sec and any oversight they ’re enforced to do since they know it ’s toothless now
my brother is an atc so i ’m gon na have to see what the inside scoop is on how they feel about the faa being rendered toothless next time i see him
the existence of the fda is compelled by the laws that were enacted to ensure drug safety since then various other laws were enacted that expanded its scope its mission those laws approve the spending of funds for the executive branch to enforce those laws by instituting rules everyone must follow but a lot of what the fda does is interpretation of the spirit of those laws and its mission generally and not specifically mandated by any law that ’s the same for every gov agency there are no gov agencies created thru chevron deference but a lot of what they do is only defensible in the sense that it ’s within the spirit of the law the mission of the agency broadly we often see department heads in front of congress justifying that their actions followed the law that ’s enough they do n’t have to show that what they did was mandated by the law that ’s my take anyway we ’ll see what agencies will be most affected by this there ’ll be a lot more work for lawyers and judges just about every unpopular gov action is under the gun
whole point is to keep them mad at the other so they 'll just blame their sick and dying relatives on obamacare and claim it 's migrants and aliens and leftist ecoterrorists poisoning the wells and starting wildfires next time you have the misfortune to hear a conservative rant about globalists ask them to name them or at least describe them then ask why pro republican billionaires with billions in overseas capital are n't included on their list ask them why federal and state contracting firms and defense industry giants and automobile companies and appliance manufacturers get to just be good businessmen because they generally stay silent on idpol issues while maximizing returns but the beer companies and shaving companies and video game studios are globalists my own fucking mother is dependent on obamacare for the medication that keeps her alive but she does n't even realize it she 's convinced her healthcare is a wholly separate program that republicans put into place for good honest americans these people live in a different reality and they have shown repeatedly that they 're happy to kill and die live on facebook and twitch if it means owning the libs
these guys would start cleaning their kitchens with benzene if they thought it would own a lib then blame the democrats for their cancer
being scared is the appropriate reaction country ’s fucked we can vote but it ’s about to get a lot worse
yeah i used to be young and thought that was an insanely dumb idea but as i got older i grew into thinking jefferson had a really great point
psa getting arrested protesting may cost you the opportunity to vote if we can get enough people to actually turn up and give us a democratic president and for once enough of a majority in congress to bypass the obstructionist republicans they could stack the court and pass legislation to rein in the corruption
some people right this very moment are saying this is biden 's fault for not doing more too with the end result being even worse things happening i do n't think anyone can claim fearmongering with trump anymore we know what he 's done and we know what he 's going to do part 2 is going to be worse
let ’s not let rbg off the hook obama asked her to retire and her own hubris based on wanting the first female us president to replace her had a massive part in getting us to where we are today
they 're not looking they do n't care as long as the people they do n't like are unhappy
and orange julius caesar will also add 3 more and say the dems were gon na do too
to everyone who has the capacity to end fascism everyone else is excused
yes we ’d love your economy
the first major crisis is how to deal with two vancouvers
a worm got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died rfk jr
i 'm a fucking republican i want to be republican i want to vote for someone conservative biden could literally already be in the ground 6 feet under and i 'm still voting for him edit i appreciate the conversation questions and constructive conversations but i got ta dip plans for the day
i fear what it 's going to take for them to start figuring that out
you know that dirty fuck does n't tip anyone let 's be real
it 's a tip michael how much could it be 50 grand
this actually is n't far off what kavanaugh actually wrote
and under trump no tax on tips projection baby
i wonder if billionaires will ever complain about judges turning the ipad around for them to select their tip percentage
not until you 're a ' supreme ' outside if the supreme who 's paying aileen canon
they will fix the need to even show up it will eventually just be a tablet at their seat that will spin around when some corporation wants a ruling in their favor and the only options are rv yacht trip tahoe
who is clarence thomas ' sugar daddy
you 've clearly never had a judge rule in your favor against all precedent and it shows
they serve the public and the public tips them via taxes or did until this morning so since the corporations are gon na foot the bill do we get to stop paying taxes or do we start forcibly retiring these judges from their lifelong term
they are they just are n't serving you
i know people want to joke about “ founding fathers bad ” and they have their issues dear lord do they ever but on this i really think they ’re right we were n’t supposed to be fucking ruled over like this this kind of bullshit would have enraged people like washington and jefferson so no this is n’t “ originalism ” or whatever nonsense the court tries to spin it as this week it was never supposed to be like this but the roberts court does n’t care hopefully one day they ’re looked back on with the same kind of disgust the taney court is now fuck
they 're rolling so fast we could use that as sustainable energy at this point
what trump did back then was legal and he has immunity but not going forward also if trump wins and does something to violate this ruling we 'll just not take the case
all presidents are immune to and protected from all criminal charges stemming from their actions while in office this applies to retroactive situations but will not begin to apply for current presidents until january 20th 2025 the court also reserves the right to suspend and re invoke this initiative as they see fit in order to preserve the sanctity of law
it has been about 20 years since the last time the court made a one time not precedent setting decision that explicitly helped a republican presidential candidate
would be a real shame of the court was hung like a jury only more deadly
this would n't surprise me one bit there will be a 2nd civil war and it will be we the americans against scotus and gop i believe the women will end scotus
but the french did n’t have to deal with catastrophic climate change
modern rebellions tend not to happen without some form of military civil police support
people were literally in the senate chambers a few years ago if it was n’t led by the most incompetent people possible they could ’ve killed key politicians i ’m not saying that should ’ve happened just that it clearly was n’t as difficult as one would ’ve thought
they ’d just use a few drones and the militia would be done all the ar15s would n’t stand a chance against that wikipedia says there are 300 reaper drones some of which are with other countries that 's 6 per state six drones wo n't do shit against millions of people or change the tide of a conflict yes there are other drone types and they would be deadly but a civil war is n't decided by those types of weapons it would be thousands of small scale attacks against government infrastructure and soft targets where people gather the us government could n't easily suppress a widespread civil conflict even with a massive technology advantage have we the us population learned nothing from vietnam afghanistan iraq or any of the many other low intensity conflicts the us has been involved in over the last half century
the chess analogy was only to convey that things are not as simple as they once were but i 'll bite what are these pawns going to be doing in your scenario
my climate change denying maga aunt left commiefornia for florida during the trump years her new home was destroyed by a hurricane within a couple of months
i think the country has reached the apex of greed money is the only thing anybody cares about anymore and it 's both money and power for politicians in terms of climate wait until climate migration really kicks in some countries will be uninhabitable because of heat
i highly encourage you to read if we burn by vincent bevins globally the elite conservative class is well organized and incredibly adept at filling the power vacuum that leftist mass protests create the whole book is about why mass protests have n't led to much real change over the last 15 years and have actually resulted in even more severe right leaning policies on many occasions it 's very enlightening
oh man it did n't it definitely existed long before occupy but the advent of cheap smart phones around that time definitely sent it skyward
you have more faith than i do about a next democratic president trump gets in and he tears the whole place down where there wo n’t be one or he ’ll have any democrat removed until it ’s a “ democrat ” based on the party ’s approval
the more the country sees that their way is fucking awful there 's a snap back coming and it 's going to be big it may take a few years but it 's coming less optimistic view we 're coming up on some extreme refugee crises around the world both from within and without countries as global warming keeps making it ' the hottest year on record ' with ' the strongest storm ever recorded ' conservatives did everything they could to sabotage any solutions over the last few decades and now will peddle age old fear of desperate outsiders to stay in power and with waves of refugees voters will go for it not being bright enough to think ahead and consider whether even they might be one of the refugees at some point soon remember trump was a year into completely mishandling the pandemic four years into all of his bs and he gained millions of votes in his second election compared to his first getting the second most in us history only being outdone by biden getting the most it was n't a gradual jump which happens each election either there was a huge jump in voters and many of them raced towards the moron peddling lazy denial of reality despite all the evidence in front of their eyes
it is pretty funny that the rest of ya’ll took another four years to come to the logical conclusion of what must be done
man first we have to dodge the bullet of it getting worse next year i ’m not even confident we are going to do that anymore
the next decade will define the death of the republican party it can sunset with what tiny measure of grace and dignity it still has or it can burn out quickly by rendering itself so repugnant to the electorate that it has no choice but to hotload fascism that it actually has not effectively prepared
they wo n’t though because they ’re the same party they ’re all grifters when will people wake up we are already way past the point of no return
brother the most important election was 2016 and it ’s not even close if clinton won we would have a 5 4 liberal scotus well on our way to a 6 3 liberal scotus and the united states would be progressing forward instead it ’s 6 3 soon to be 7 2 conservative once trumpy wins in november and it ’s going to be one of the most regressive era ’s in history probably will rival the dark ages
how would they enforce they do n't control the enforcers president and our representatives control the enforcers they can say abortion is illegal but it 's meaningless if prosecutors das and law enforcement do n't do anything
more like good people do n't turn to fighting unless they have to albert camus was a pacifist acitivist until wwii where he accepted his draft and then rejected for prior tb sometimes the best way to stop violence actually is with violence
mlk summed this up i have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the negro 's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the white citizen 's counciler or the ku klux klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice people prefer a lack of conflict to justice they 'd rather live in an unjust society with their head down hoping they are n't targeted than stand up and fight
the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity
i do n't want to abolish the supreme court i want to dissolve this one and replace it with a supreme court that is just a higher level district court cases should be assigned to random 5 judge panels drawn from a 30 judge court judges should be appointed to single 20 30 year terms
checks and balances are gone now the supreme court can literally overrule any decision they do n’t believe is “ constitutional ” solely based on their opinion
not only that but it 's impossible to legislate all this stuff for example regulating wetlands requires nuance every wetland is unique and ever changing you pass a law that says environmental experts must do x y and z then you 're either stuck doing x y and z or you have to pass a new lad every six months when conditions change or i suppose you could have a lawsuit every six months for every conceivable scenario that 's what they just asked for and really it 's such an utterly bizarre stupid request that i have to assume the feds are just going to largely ignore this decision in everything but a few particular cases of their pet billionaires choosing what 's the alternative osha just cease to function until june every year when the justices decide to issue decisions on hundreds of thousands of regulations for new and rapidly evolving industries
it 's also because we 're a common law system not civil law our statutes are very short when compared to countries like france
one of the very few things that christianity had right the love of money is the root of all evil
i 'll never forget when my conservative stepmom said that my generation entitled millenials was crazy for thinking we were entitled to clean water this was in a conversation about my job as an environmental scientist where i focus on making water clean
the republicans would n’t have allowed her to be replaced we keep blaming the democrats telling biden to step down yelling at ourselves meanwhile trump ’s performance in the debate was wholly disqualifying he literally admitted to colluding with the leader of an enemy country in the debate he admitted a crime and yet it ’s biden who needs to step down i just do n’t get it why do we keep blaming ourselves when it ’s insane republicans who are destroying the country
mitch want giving obama any seats
then it is a 2 3 vote to impeach which would never happen with the 2 party system
south vancouver and north vancouver
save us from their patrioetry
this is what i do n’t understand about americans and american politics you have said that trump can not be elected so have declared that you ’re going to vote otherwise cool so what makes you “ republican ” and “ conservative ” that you want fewer rights for people or you want the worse economy that happens under every republican president since 2000 i know i ’m phrasing that aggressively and for that i apologise but i do n’t understand what morals you ’re tying yourself to when you can see what they do i guess what i ’m saying is you seem to have an idea about what “ a republican ” is that is separate to what the actual republicans do and say does n’t that therefore make you not a republican
i expect with chevron overturned something cataclysmic something that winds up killing their constituents a lit of them were cool with roe v wade and they 've had their fuck around phase now it 's time to find out
he 's also a man who has n't made himself so much as a sandwich in 30 years while still complaining that the poor people do n't want to work anymore as 5 us tax paid staffers help him into his underwear and robe
does leaving a pube on a soda can not count anymore
90 % of tipped workers already pay no income tax because they 're fucking broke
hahaha oh damn and now i 'm sad
i got a chuckle out of that a very sad chuckle just what the fuck what i need right now is to listen to a few more political analysts tell me that i 'm overreacting by calling the court illigitimate obviously they 're not biased because they did n't outlaw the abortion drug fucking idiots all of them
harlan crowe besides the rv and trips crowe bought thomas ' mother 's house and 2 vacant lots from the thomas family at about double market value paid to repair the house and allowed thomas ' mother to live there crow said he purchased thomas ’ mother ’s house where thomas spent part of his childhood to preserve it for posterity crowe also said that the neighborhood is full of derelicts drug users and junkies yet neither him or thomas have moved the 94 year old from the house to a better location
if you stopped with the avocado toast then you could take the judges in your cases on luxury vacations too
washington would have hung them as traitors 0 % doubt in my mind
at least one of those dumb corrupt fucks would have been caned by now if it was the early united states
we are only ruling in a very narrow sense and in that sense we mean for donald trump and literally no one else before or after
this is the gravity the s c needs right now
as in the supreme court i would n't be opposed i 've got a family heirloom from the french revolution in my possession ready to pass to my son
and here i thought as a foreigner that usa had the second amendement so the public could do something about bad government it 's what those right wing douchbags always tell me when i say restricting gun ownership seriously reduces the amount of people getting murdered
“ funnily ” enough the french revolution was precipitated in part due to major climate events like the little ice age and one of the worst hail storms ever recorded in july so maybe history rhymes
and the revolution french had not been as bamboozled out of their own self interest by a mega media machine
modern rebellions tend to lead to military juntas
the same is pretty true of historical rebellions as well
have we the us population learned nothing yes we have learned nothing
also not even accounting for the fact that each drone strike is an attack on your own infrastructure we struggle fighting a country where we do n’t even have to pay for the damages done by our armaments are they just going to lay waste to the major cities the most blue areas of the country
i was just having a discussion with a coworker whom was flabbergasted at the idea that i do n't care to be a billionaire i do n't i want enough money to support my relatively modest in comparison to the rich lifestyle whatever personal endeavors i might want to undertake and that 's it i do n't want to strike it rich and the very idea confused him there is more to life than money but our society has made it the end all of everything we are the polar opposite of fictional utopias like star trek i do n't see how we could possibly end up there at this point
i thought for sure expanding the court to match the amount of circuits to be part of the first 100 days for biden guess checks and balances died decades ago
it will define the death of the united states and it 's people as well
instead it ’s 6 3 soon to be 7 2 conservative once trumpy wins in november and it ’s going to be one of the most regressive era ’s in history probably will rival the dark ages lgbtq rights will be stripped hell trans rights may very well be obliterated with this alone since congress did n't explicitly let the fda approve hormone therapy they 've talked about camps to deport migrants the next step will be repurposing those camps to hold trans people but eventually lgbtq people too the religious right has infected the government it only took 30 % of the people for the taliban to take regressive control pretty sure the number is the same for the nazis originally maga has around 30 % support we have history to look to to see that that 's enough for a regressive authoritarian state to take over
not the dark ages think taliban extreme power fueled by god said we have the right and you do n't
yes my point i think andrew jackson did this in the 1800 ’s gon na have to dust off my history books this court has already proven that they will rule against health and freedoms for americans maybe americans should ignore these rulings
i 'd rather be intolerant of intolerance first and hope it does n't get to the violence stage
we do n't have to sit back and let them do that they 're openly corrupt we did n't elect them and they have no army or police force the people we elect have those and those people can also ignore them if they want and we should protest that they make changes to the court or ignore them whichever is easiest or more effective i 'm not going to accept the unelected fuck faces of the court ruling over the entire country
fair point but the turtle would have had a lot harder time denying seats for multiple years than just the “ election year ” bullshit he did also might have had more voters out for clinton if rbgs seat hung in the balance she also could have retired during the 111th congress at the beginning of obama ’s term when democrats controlled both houses but he did n’t ask until 2013 she knew for a long time her health was shit at least we got flowery neck doilies
the first trump impeachment trial should have had subpoenaed evidence and witnesses but fat bastard had a turtle head poking out who prevented it i do n't know why the second impeachment trial lacked the same important elements because the turtle head was n't the majority leader at that time even the toothless he said she said second trial should have been a no brainer after jan 6 my guess is by that time the tangerine traitor had time to remind his spineless enablers which side their bread was buttered on
welcome to the ferengenar justice system deposit one strip of gold pressed latinum to speak to the magistrate 1 bar if you want to sleep in your own bed tonight
his name sounds like a character from there will be blood lmao
i 'm guessing that 's not a credenza or a hassock
that ’s fair but civilian militias have historically led small scale rebellions
lincoln did it as well when taney the dred scott guy tried to challenge lincoln on his suspension of habeus corpus during the civil war lincoln just ignored him and taney eventually said he could n't do anything but send a notice
we need some civil disobedience does shitting on kavanagh 's doorstep count that 's all i 've got
sure that 's true but for the most part the ones that succeeded in widespread change then and now were the ones who got the military police on their side or at the very least the ones where enough of those groups were not particularly eager to risk their lives for the existing government
after the debate someone on the cbs panel said that the dems agreed to no live fact check hard to believe given their opponent is addicted to lying
get the boebert moderator he challenged everyone on anything he knew was false he demanded non pandering answers i 'm not sure if i 've even seen a moderator own his debate more than that he actually might have helped her win the primary he was equally tough on all candidates
the scientific community learned this a couple decades ago dealing with creationist liars when someone does n't care about facts and reality and is willing just to just throw oceanic tidal waves of lies at you the only way to successfully debate them is to not do it there 's simply no way to successfully respond to all of it that 's where the term gish gallop came from dwayne gish was a creationist famous for using this technique the way the scientific community dealt with him was by refusing to engage him in live debates and insist on doing it in writing where they could pull each lie out one by one and engage with full scientific rigor and citations guess did not like this because it was a successful way to show how full of crap he was and discredit him problem here is that most of the people who might have bought anything that trump said are n't going to be reading the follow up fact checks
if his mouth is making sounds he is lying
i stopped watching when trump was talking about post birth abortions and other than biden saying that trump was lying there was n't any repercussions to his blatant lies and now given an even larger stage to tell them i could n't take anymore
they never planned on moderating they are fixated on ratings the more viewers the better that means allowing it to be a shitshow
just wanted to say i think the use of the word slammed in i heading should n't be punishable 30 years in prison unless someone connected with someone else at speed
it 's a lot more than just letting trump lie to be clear i am done with cnn after that they lied to us about the fact checks and the aftershow was a complete abomination of the truth they lost all credibility apparently lies all over cnn are totally cool now
it would be ideal to have live fact checking scrolling on the bottom for both candidates w o having to interrupt the debate the networks up till the present have n't why i do n't know i was always under the impression the press was responsible to inform the public in a democracy what better way than to fact check potus candidates in real time and have a more informed public hell they have peyton and eli watching football in real time why ca n't two other top level anchors watch a debate and comment fact check in real time are they telling us nfl football is more important than who we elect potus
i 'm repeating myself but and jake tapper was useless
at least keep him on topic the whole thing was a disaster
i used to enjoy jake tapper but lately he 's been shitting the bed habitually
pbs was giving a live time fact check but i think they gave up because they could n't keep up
the gop strategy was to accuse the moderators of bias all week and sway them from interfering i hoped they would n’t fall for it but it ’s cnn and they are a bunch of cowards
does n't anyone remember the cnn trump interview from not too long ago i assumed people learned then that cnn and most mainstream media want the trump circus for ratings the debate was never going to stay on the rails and cnn was okay with that
trump declared his fealty to despots and his disdain for america so on that note we heard him loud and clear
just get this guy kyle clark from colorado he did an excellent job moderating the co gop debate talk about must watch tv
trump lied and did not answer questions all he does is ramble
if only there had been some way of knowing trump was going to lie every time he spoke on a serious note jake tapper all but tacitly admitted this was n’t a debate when he told trump he can use his minute however he likes
i dropped cnn after they allowed the trump town hall the debate just reinforced that decision cnn is a shell of its former self
what had me the most fucked up was that he straight up said babies were being aborted after they were born
lying while not answering the question
they had to know he was going to lie it ’s who he is and has always been it is so irresponsible for them not to call him on those lies they might as well have given him an hour show with no limits very disappointed in cnn and lack of journalistic integrity
that should be the takeaway from this debate it 's ridiculous to consider the candidate who said post birth abortions are a thing the winner of this debate are you for fucking real trump answered zero questions made up things as he went and lied non stop not a single drop of substance or even any facts numbers but that 's apparently the gold standard because he did all of this with confidence and energy cnn can go fuck itself i 've said it yesterday and i say it today trump was right with one thing cnn is fake news
yes they were terrible when you ask a question and trump does n't even answer it and instead talks about immigration or whatever you cut his mic and interrupt him immediately nope the question was you have 80 seconds left
i found the bit where trump would say things like everybody knows it the hosts know it insert blatant lie the most annoying and telling of cnn abject debasement
that 's exactly why it 's better to tune into cspan or pbs and not cnn to watch these events we need to stop watching their network and enabling this shit
the format of the debate was designed to limit trump 's ability to talk over shout over his opponent and to eliminate audience participation these were good ideas but once again the democrats show that they fundamentally do not understand republicans and trump in particular republicans do not behave in good faith they are in it to win and they understand far better than the democrats that substance is second or third compared to flash and appearance the stipulation of no notes etc was never going to hurt trump he would n't have used them anyway his tactics have always been to lie and throw as much shit as he thinks will stick the lack of notes as well as the continued failure to understand that trump is not someone who is willing to behave according to any established standards of behavior hurt biden because he generally behaves in good faith at this point it 's the frog and the scorpion x 1000 democrats have got to stop trying to look like the good guys and need to start winning decisively and publicly
the whole thing was setup like a game show spectacle it was n't a debate it was an attempt at ratings and making money the american people indeed the whole world is losing because these are the candidates we have to choose from wtf how did it come to this
so it ’s not like these were nuanced hard to detect lies that require research and analysis biden absolutely should have called trump out for saying that states allow post birth abortions or that nancy pelosi took responsibility for january 6 yes it ’s insane that trump said these things but what ’s crazier is biden largely let him get away with it on a national stage
cnn was sold to pro republican conglomerates and their ceo is a pro trump facilitator wake up america the entire country is being sold either sell out or say no
i cut my cable as to not endorse cnn and fox i sleep much better now
as they should be it was a disgrace
i ’m more upset that biden did n’t push back enough there were easy quick responses to every time he mentioned inflation they call it “ biden ’s inflation ” to hide the fact that every developed nation dealt with it trump was n’t going to magically avoid it but nobody ever comes back with that simple fact
lest we forget cnn has been under new ownership for about the last two years almost as long as they have been running on about biden ’s age so to speak
so let me get this straight ahead of time cnn said they would n't be doing any realtime fact checking how is anyone surprised at the result how can you be mad at cnn for doing exactly what they said the time to be mad was beforehand when they could actually do something about it
cnn also laser focused on biden 's poor performance afterwards and entirely ignored trump 's and other news sources followed suit which made it look like biden did terribly and trump came out unscathed when in reality they both did horrendous but yea we can see the narrative being built by the media organizations they love trump trump sells news right left indifferent they want trump in office so expect every headline from now until election night to be some form of biden being too old ignoring that trump is literally just twoish years younger or too senile ignoring trump 's inability to string a single sentence together
dana bash is notoriously weak
so you 're saying democrats do n't give birth to live babies and then murder them and joe biden is n't a palestinian
too right cnn are a disgrace i thought there was to be fact checking trump wo n't turn up for further debates if fact checking is allowed now
cnn needs to be boycotted because of this tacit support of fascism while my trust of this company has always been limited it is now effectively nil
i did n’t see the debate because i was working can someone tell me what was lied about
i 'm voting for biden but wo n't be watching the next debate it 's clear that cnn is garbage so i wo n't waste my time again
why would cnn do anything different in their hosted debate when largely speaking their anchors do n’t do it during their panels or interviews it is baked in that they provide a platform for these lies and only timidly have opposition participants who attempt to counter statements
why is anyone surprised that the network bought out by conservatives would help trump
slammed that will show them
cnn getting slammed after the fact does n't help at all when all the maga toads undecideds and fence sitters were allowed to listen to an uncorrected stream of lies no answer to the questions pivot lie pivot lie conferring legitimacy on him by not correcting him or halting the proceedings calling him out and holding his feet to the fire cnn enabled him in every way that 's blatant support this is tantamount to a propaganda psyop on a grand scale not to mention one of the greatest journalistic disservices to the nation in our history an informational coup d'état in full view
“ they even let you abort the baby after it ’s born ” “ thank you ”
look up the gish gallup this needs to be widely known and understood
slammed by who by people already voting for biden to make themselves feel better i love biden i ’ve watched every major speech and every debate he ’s been in during the past 15 years he ’s one of my heroes this is on him and his team they were fully aware or should have been that they were n’t gon na be able to count on the moderators to call out lies look no further than what happened to candy crowley in 2008 the deflections and excuses and finger pointing from liberals is not helpful this is not the time to make ourselves feel better you want to help biden have uncomfortable conversations with your minimally engaged friends family members and neighbors about the stakes in november that ’s how we win this
cnn has been an empty shell of what it used to be since convicted felon trump ran the first time around
it would nt have mattered the debate was nt about trump it was about biden being able to effectively respond to trump and biden crashed hard cnn ca nt let trump do anything put trump on a stage and he 's going to use it the democrats would have been wiser to just not let biden debate at all he really did nt need to now people are talking about biden 's mental fitness instead of multiple felonies convictions question is what now as a campaign strategist do you let biden try again for debate 2 or do you take the loss and hope time makes people forget and just not debate again who knows what those people are thinking now
what is cnn supposed to do trump lies constantly they ca n't keep halting the debate to fact check biden as the opponent should be calling out his bullshit
it ’s not cnn ’s job to assist biden by calling out trump ’s lies that ’s biden ’s job it ’s a ridiculous concept for moderators to interrupt a debate
might as well have a computer voice reading a text sheet of questions at specified 2 minute intervals if not going to call out blatant lies and get policy relevant responses they were acting the part of timekeeping prompt reading robots not moderators some jobs ai can do perfectly well and bash tapper proved that theirs is one of them at cnn foxlite
why was this not established in the terms for the debate real time fact checking is absolutely necessary here
oh please if i 've learned anything about the moderate base they are going to shrug their shoulders and forget this happened in two months
could n't they at least publicly admonish him and request he cease his lies
i do n't even know what you just said and i do n't think you do either
cnn the new faux news
have we tried unplugging and then plugging either of them back in
what the actual fuck is the point of cnn if not to fact check toddlers if they attempt to re run for president
surely to god no one thought that fucking asshole trump would do anything but lie how would being on a debate stage be any different than any other time this convicted criminal opens his fucking piehole
everything that comes out of the cheetos mouth is an fing lie and america knows it it 's the magats that choose not to believe it because they drank the kool aid
if they did n’t trump could n’t talk
cnn has evolved into being a trump apologist in a greedy effort to capture the maga audience and advertisers aiming at the maga audience
yes cnn should not do a debate unless they can fact check because this election is too important trump just stood there a lied
it 's called flooding the zone
i watch cnn and other than the whole having to live in the world bit it is kind of funny that they 'd accidentally risk ending democracy for ratings
to call what happened a debate is a joke screw cnn
but apparently people considered that winning for trump
i liked the time that the don lied about his power to end the war in ukraine before he is inaugurated before he is actually president and a bit of time when he is absolutely not president sounds like just a bit of light treason not his job until jan 20 god forbid
the moderators had access to turn off his chumps mike they allowed him to lie and did not give biden the opportunity to respond to the lie they moved on to another question
trump needs a shock collar and every time he lies it goes off
i 'm done with cnn they 're weak and enabling the red hats f cnn
honestly this is n't cnn 's responsibility if viewers can have some goof stand up on live tv and spew fantasy and falsehoods and nobody cares this is on the us population everyone and i mean everyone should know by now that trump just word vomits fantasy and lunacy constantly if they do n't they never will and everyone in the media should be talking about this lunatic who makes up trash and not how biden seems old biden is old so is trump biden did n't spew out stupid lunatic nonsense instead of old man is old in debate we should be seeing lunatic rambling old man trump makes things up entire debate does he live in our reality where the hell are the stories about trump 's nonsensical gibberish fantasies
this feels like it should be bidens job
but biden beat medicare so its all good
i ’m so fucking tired of reading about people and organizations being “ slammed ” when did journos decide that this was their favorite word i do n’t know why this style of headline gets under my skin so much it ’s somehow too casual and completely melodramatic at the same time
the damage control to correct the lies is monumental how many ads do you need to run
you know who also let trump lie the entire debate biden we are sleep walking to disaster
i think trump is a piece of shit but let 's be honest you can have a cat instead of trump and just let biden talk and biden still would have lost the debate i think biden is a decent guy for the most part but this is sad to see one should know it is time
some of biden ’s lies even cnn has to air a correction “ i ’m the only president who did n’t have any troops die anywhere in the world ” false 15 cap on insulin false it ’s 35 200 cap on drug spending with medicare false it ’s 2000 boarder crossings are fewer than when trump is false employment was 15 % when he took office false it was 6 4 % trump wants to get rid of social security false he does n’t boarder patrol supports him false they very publicly do not
it is nt their job to live fact check that ’s biden job being the other debate participant
and not slammed for letting biden lie a confirmed 9 times interesting bias
trump is vile but i do n't think that 's their job fact check after yep the debate is for the candidates to speak uninterrupted and the people to judge the real problem is that half the american people are too stupid or mean spirited to make a rational decision
they also did not stop biden from lying
how about biden lying about the border agent union endorsing him how about biden 's very fine people lie or what about his lol 6 golf handicap lie
i 've been reading slamming articles since 2015 they mean nothing they are what lead us to this
does cnn really care as long as people are watching on their platform i 'm amazed anyone thought cnn was going to conduct this properly even in the weeks leading up to it
i seriously think someone fucked with biden 's water it was like night and day after watching biden today in raleigh he did n't look at all fucked up as he showed last night
i have turned this noise off permanently i will do what needs to be done in the voting booth but this level of fervor serves zero purpose outside of media chasing ratings it ’d disgraceful
people were caught off guard by biden 's appearance but now articles will start to parse trumps bullshit this will generate weeks of headlines and it will influence voters as well people are tired of the bullshit this will be a daily reminder
to the melody of rocky road to dublin as performed by the dropkick murphys verse 1 in the merry month of june from my home i started left the white house with my mind heavy hearted bid adieu to jill and son hugged 'em with devotion take the road to debate cold in my head cancel i have no notion chorus one two three four five hunting for the votes to strive tackling lies more lies and dirty lies on the rocky road to re election working night and day to keep the fanta ogre at bay on the rocky road the rocky road to re election verse 2 through the states and counties wide faced the gop 's delusions with their endless empty promises sowing great confusion trump with all his legal woes felonies and trials spreading falsehoods far and wide phony crowds for miles and miles chorus one two three four five hunting for the votes to strive tackling lies and racist cries on the rocky road to re election working night and day to keep the great cheeto at bay on the rocky road the rocky road to re election verse 3 rallying the folks around to see the truth unveiled in the face of all the noise we never can be derailed fighting for the common man policies to cherish battling the tides of lies we 'll make sure they perish chorus one two three four five hunting for the votes to strive tackling lies or hate and evil arise on the rocky road to re election working night and day to keep the tangerine tyrant at bay on the rocky road the rocky road to re election verse 4 trump desires power grand like a dictator reigning day one he 'd command with freedom steadily waning praising putin kim jong un for their iron hand had an affair with a porn star campaign funds to underhand chorus one two three four five hunting for the votes to strive tackling lies or democracy dies on the rocky road to re election working night and day to keep the spray tan man at bay on the rocky road the rocky road to re election bridge with conviction we 'll stand tall amidst the noise and fury truth and justice even with a stutter for us all is the judge and jury facing down the endless lies from trump and his cult army in the end we 'll rise above no need for an alar min ' chorus one two three four five hunting for the votes to strive exposing all the lies and supreme court judges to buy on the rocky road to re election working night and day to keep the mango maniac at bay on the rocky road the rocky road to re election outro so onward now we march along through trials and tribulations with the strength to right the wrongs for future generations victory is ours to take with truth and dedication on the rocky road the rocky road to freedom la dee daaa
two issues with this the moderators may not be responsible for fact checking like i thought they were but trump said very blatant lies that were very public without any resistance from anyone no follow up questions or repeating his actual quotes the other part is trump spewed so much bs and did n’t tell a single complete truth but the moderators never brought him back to topic there ’s no way biden could have spent his time correcting trump because it would be arguing every single point of nonsense trump said every time
cnn also needs to be slammed for not putting cameras over the moderators joe was clearly talking to the moderators during his answers and his camera made it look like he was searching for someone to talk to
everything is at fault except the candidate you chose to run lmao
it was not the responsibility of cnn to fact check trump it was biden ’s job
it was joe ’s job to fact check the fascist felon he was n’t up to it last night and that impression is going to stick w the kind of voters we need to win
they let him lie through the entire debate so they could call out the lies for the next two weeks raking in ratings cash in the process
is n't it obvious trump is lying though like if it 's not obvious to someone he 's a lying narcissist then that person is already brain rotted beyond help anyone pointing out his lies is ' fake news ' or ' deep state ' or whatever
cnn slammed for letting trump lie nonstop on cnn again
he really should n't lie about anything i was told biden wanted after birth abortions and he never said that so wtf they just outright believed trump and told it as if that was what biden said
it was probably a condition of the trump team for letting it happen at all
cnn really dropped the ball on this debate
they were more indignant that biden forgot some lines while dealing with a cold and battling a toad
after 3 lies i ’d like to see the floor beneath the candidates open up and swallow them like the bad egg veruka salt in willy wonka and the chocolate factory
cnn wants the great restoration and begs america to vote for the orange turd
who could have seen this coming s
they did what they set out to do
as soon as they began comparing handicaps i threw up my hands this is what our national parties gave us for their best
part of me believes they want him back in office because ratings were never better with the clown doing clown things
new social experiment stick trump and biden in an old retirement home and see how long they can last as roommates
how hard were they slammed will they ever recover from the intense slamming
kaitlin collins when she interviewed trump previously was taken to f’ing cleaners no one should be surprised by cnn ’s incompetence
this entire thing has to be rigged i just ca n’t any more honestly it ’s probably some insane trick the billionaire are playing on us all insane
what a farce why let trump spew lie after lie after lie same old same old
cnn is owned by conservatives
cnn 's job was to make trump look good they did their best
his lies were not new but told dozens or hundreds of times so how hard would it have been to put up a family feud style buzzer
why they gave him rope he hung himself look at his dwindling base they are even making reps for biden signs after the conviction to come out swinging with barefaced lies in a debate that he knows is going to be scrutinised to a minute degree honestly they both looked like bumbling idiots but for those undecided republicans who have had a sneaky suspicion that they are being led by a charlatan maybe its a bit clearer that even a bumbling idiot is better than someone who treats your intelligence with such utter contempt
the takeaway should be aoc and her wing heartfelt as it is must unite behind her party and not play to the trumpian usa or did the fall of bowman not teach that
slammed like they give a fuck
i thought i was watching muhammad ali i am the greatest
people need to take accountability
a couple posts on twitter cnn slammed
slamming does n’t do anything anymore
first they should never have debates again it 's a popularity contest if they do keep them use an ai buzzer to catch lies
i 'm done using cnn as my what people who do n't read see generic news site it 's been straight news entertainment garbage for a while if i catch it on a tv bar i 'll make sure to not support any advertisers i see
i no longer have bad thoughts i only have thoughts the dnc wants me to have
they were n’t moderators at all they were like middle school time keepers i ’m still aghast about how after a question mein pumpkinfurher jumped back one or two questions to bullshit but biden then tried to answer that bullshit answer the question we will see the liar for who he really is
this whole thing is a shitshow trump biden the debate their ages and the supreme court
agreed while watching the debate my friend and i were talking about how a fact check banner needs to run while the candidates are speaking
cnn could n't do anything if they did the cultists would claim fake news the debates should n't have happened in the first place it was n't going to sway anyone regardless how anyone performed cultists are going to vote trump no matter what the sane people will vote for a tree if it meant keeping trump out of office
is this a headline from the babylon bee
what a waste of time cnn should fold up the tent and go away
on some level it ’s supposed to be a debate between the two candidates how they fared against each other
were they slammed i ’m sure they felt slammed i ’m sure they ’re ashamed and they ’ll never do it again because they ’ll be so scared of being slammed again
cnn always manages to disappoint
biden ’s team agreed to the terms every other rule was at their request
cnn has been shit for years but i 'm sure that 's part of why they were picked as a network
cnn moderators added no value and very little expertise on political subject matter someone off the street could have just read the questions
no democrat should ever participate in a cnn debate again they are doing everything they can to elect that felon
there was a point about 40 minutes in where trump claims he was just given numbers before coming onto the stage i think it was about the economy during his administration and he said they were the best numbers or something similar i just sat there and was like this guy who has nt been in office for almost 4 years now is claiming his staff just dug up some awesome economic numbers from that time and all he says is they were the best numbers i refuse to believe people are stupid enough to believe this guy he never gives anything of substance its always we had the best x numbers or our y numbers are better than yours he never actually talks about what the numbers are or what they represent or anything
i ’m sorry but if someone in a debate is telling blatant lies is n’t it the job of the opponent to call them out biden missed plenty if opportunities to shut trump down and set the record straight it ’s not cnn ’s fault biden ’s shithouse at debating
biden may have been a bit out of it but aphasia aside everything he said made sense trump said insane horrible things and refused to accept the results of the elections biden won that debate trump lost it ’s a shame that biden had trouble talking but the idea that what trump said during the debate made sense is malarkey
the only prep advice biden should have gotten was this every time trump shut his mouth and biden ’s mic turned on biden needed to say “ before i answer i want to make it clear every word that just came out of the convicted felon ’s mouth was a lie ” every single time biden ’s mic turned on he should ’ve led with that every time no stats no rebuttals no facts just simply make sure everyone knows trump is lying and he ’s a felon that ’s it
this does n’t matter anymore none of this does it happened it ’s done let ’s move on
cnn slammed for being cnn ftfy
that 's why while i do n't wany to slam biden personally for his health and definitely not for his speech impediment i just wish we had a candidate up there who was sharp tongued and could hold at least half his lies accountable we could really use an ' 07 ' 08 obama kind of orator right now
joe had to do his job and the mods ’ that would overwhelm almost everyone
it was just a reminder of why i stopped watching cnn
i do n’t know why anyone is shocked the media for the most part is just as complicit
maybe pick better questions instead of asking turmp about the 2020 election as him why all his election fraud cases were thrown out for not presenting evidence to his own appointed judges why did n't he present evidence why did his own judges throw his election fraud cases those are n't even loaded questions
you mean the conservative news network
“ no troops died under my watch ” “ border patrol endorsed me ”
these articles are infuriating and do nothing to help everyone is aware that trump lied the entire time it 's the job of the other person in the debate to forcefully call him out on it handling biden with kid gloves is killing democrat chances in november stop passing the buck to cnn to do biden 's job and trying to scapegoat this
fuk cnn no mas cnn
here ’s a fun fact for everyone in this comment section politicians lie all the time seriously if none of you know this simple fact then i really do n’t know what to tell you i ’ve know this since before i could vote left right democrat republican independent green party communist socialist whatever they all fucking lie
then i suppose cnn should be slammed for letting biden lie the entire time as well as horrible as cnn is they did an ok job here only saved biden a few times
every single response to trump 's blathering should start with biden saying i think old donald over here forgot the question again so here 's my answer lets stay on topic and thanks for asking
biden ’s debate preppers should have told him to come out with strong statements do not try to quote stats people vote with emotions and he needed to keep things simple
i think what happened was biden was prepped on what trump would say about issues i do n’t think they prepped him on what happens if trump just does n’t answer the question and talks about something else entirely on top of trump having his brain melt and not making much sense on stage biden was probably caught flat footed trying to parse what the fuck he was hearing and trying to respond to it which to be fair biden still should have done better he missed a lot of key things for sure but that tripped him
i keep seeing this comment and agree with the sentiment but how on earth do you actually fact check when everything is incorrect the debate would be even less watchable and would give trump an even stringer case to play the victim
trump ca n’t breathe without lying it ’s clinical and dems are compassionate people
tbf the president was supposed to be the one who kept him in check and it would 've looked really bad if the moderators were doing more discredit a debater than his opponent it would 've been called the liberal media protecting democrats they were in a no win situation
did biden lie about anything asking for a friend
umm biden told lies as well all politicians lie their ass off
democrats constructed that entire thing to prop up biden and give him the best chance to look fine and even with the deck stacked in his favor he went out there and looked like that
fucking why jesus christ why would cnn agree to that
one side appears to be a cult and the other side appears to be incompetent great choice
if he could n’t lie they would have to just turn his mic off every 5 seconds then they ’d be blamed for silencing him better to fact check it after and show later
if they did the live fact check i 'd bet it would have looked like a three way debate less time to discuss topics even though most people involved knew a certain individual would not stay on topic regardless
biden called him out i liked how they posted the question when t man went off the rails off topic and just did n’t speak the truth
i ’m a 23 year old college student and with all the bad decisions they ’re making i think i could run the dnc
ah think biden was set up for a fall a notorious liar they could of mafe a fool of trump on live tv an didnt it tottaly stinks a think cnn have decided to join the trump train also on the trump sub they seem to think most of what biden said was fact checked after by cnn an they are saying he lied his ass off do n't know who to believe anymore a just no that if trump gets back in it will be a disaster for every day folks cos he will just use it to feather his own nest
does n’t matter live fact checks be dammed if it ’s such a blatant lie that it ’s obvious to anyone but the trump sycophants a moderator has the duty to call them out “ we had the best h2o during my presidency ” everyone sane knew that was a bold faced lie and then they even refused to even acknowledge that trump was dodging questions and yes that also means they should have pressed biden on the afghanistan non answer
what if both are lying
will there be fact checking in september
i ’m guessing they felt it would simply take up too much time and would n’t allow joe to get any of his stuff in i mean the thing would ’ve just been trump saying a sentence and then the hosts fact checking trump saying another sentence and the host fact checking again that would chew up a lot of the time they had
opponent s they are both liars
if the dems did n't agree then the debate would n't have happened there 's no way donald trump agrees to a live fact checker just was n't happening every word out of his mouth is a lie or exaggeration
“ the border patrol endorses me ” biden “ we absolutely do not endorse biden ” border patrol you are blind
they had a live fact checker joe biden
ah good to know i ’m glad i did n’t watch more than 15 minutes of that nonsense then i had a feeling it would be a waste of my time
if a lying politician is new to anyone here then you are going to be flabbergasted when you hear what a lawyer is
1 suckers and losers lie 2 hitler did good things lie 3 fine people lie 4 my son died in iraq lie 5 i capped insulin at 15 lie 6 i capped medicaid drug expenses at 200 lie 7 retaliation lie 8 trump said he would be a dictator lie 9 no soldiers died on my watch lie 10 border crossings fewer than trump lie 11 unemployment was 15 % under trump lie 12 trump wants to get rid of social security lie 13 billionaires pay 8 2 % in taxes lie 14 trump said inject bleach lie 15 border patrol endorsed me lie
there should have been a bullshit meter behind each of them trumps would have been pegged the whole time
“ the venue of a presidential debate between these two candidates is not the ideal venue for a live fact checking exercise ” david chalian head of cnn
kyle clark is his name
you do n’t even have to go that far we have apples to apples comparison for this look at the moderator performance of chris wallace in 2020 the mofo from frickin fauxnews and compare him with that ai chatbot with a timer jake tapper from cnn chris from fauxnews did a far better job at keeping trump ’s more outrageous lies in check in the old format where he had even less of an incentive to do so cnn did this after agreeing to the term of live fact checking cnn is an absolute disgrace people go off it based on it ’s older center right reputation but they ’re all in on the fascism wing someone should make a supercut of all the time wallace does a great job at live fact checking trump and keeping him in line to the best of his efforts jake tapper has fallen to the lowest level as a journalist to keep his job and satisfy his right wing billionaire boss
ok but both candidates actually have to agree to the fact checking for that to happen cnn was just following the rules set and agreed upon by the campaigns i ’m sure both moderators wanted to constantly interrupt to tell viewers about all the falsehoods
i would like to have him do all debates please
now everyhing is documented in videp what we need yo do now is pull all the lies he said and slaugther them problem is we need to convinve the dumbs it is easier to lead a water buffalo
the medium is the message is a phrase coined a long time ago and it still holds true to this day it means the format of media itself influences the messaging the medium we dealing with today is social media in this social media era everything revolves around short quips the mode of operation is scrolling infinite feeds each post has to be digestible in a few seconds or the users have already scrolled past it 's a perfect medium for gish gallop
professor dave gives it a good go
politifact analysis seems to agree with you
i imagine that when he tweets he 's also speaking outloud as well
yep they could have just posted this on the bottom of the screen and it would have been accurate as a fact check for the whole debate
imagine if dotard was a fisherman it was the biggest snook ever landed followed by i did n't have sex with that fish not my type
yes that ’s not the issue media keeps giving him a megaphone for doing it all these things will be looked back on in the future but also yes biden should have pushed back but just look at him these are the best our entire country can produce sad on all sides
this is why the whole idea of ' debating ' him seems kind of weird since he does not adhere to any debating principles but i guess the point was for his followers to be exposed to biden and see the alternative nothing more it 's so wild to me voting for representatives not for policies
if his mouth is making sounds he is dying
the post birth abortion thing is a really weird topic there seems to be a whole bunch of conspiracies stemming from the governor gave like five years ago
cnn is toast they 've fallen off the click bait cliff hard in recent years they constantly push narratives that seem agenda based and it really shows
so maybe biden should n’t have asked for it
because those were the rules both candidates agreed to
this want me to consider you an actual journalistic outlet do n't use that word
hard labor in prison too
those panelists were tripping over their own dicks trying to make a headline negative quote about biden ’s performance it was absolutely wild this was everything they were dreaming of and seriously fuck van jones and axelrod those two are literally there to be the liberals who give hot takes that make democrats and biden look bad
remember that cnn did that townhall with trump filled with his supporters hardly any pushback from the woman moderator it was a cnn promo for trumpster
i am mad at everyone but my guy who asked for this format and channel and got what he wanted and wiffed horribly facts are facts my guy play stupid games and win stupid prizes
oh noes you 're done with cnn when did cnn have any credibility was it when they helped bush lie about the iraq war and libs did n't mind it
politifact fact checked in real time even the awful golf thing so its very possible
why they did n’t do that probably because the biden campaign agreed that they would not do that during the debate
they did n't do that either
also what was up with these 3rd grade level questions they used to ask very specific geopolitical questions like talking about syria or yemen or they 'd ask about specific economic scenarios the questions they add tonight were probably the most dumbed down i 've seen from a debate ironically i think biden might have actually done better with more advanced questions nothing was gon na save him since he looked barely alive as he walked out but yeah
there used to be a website that was keeping track of trump ’s lies during his presidency i wonder what ever happened to that
no live fact checking were the terms biden agreed to his campaign and biden shit the bed we need a new candidate badly
that ’s when i removed cnn from my guide
it was the trump town hall with kaitlan collins i dropped cnn after that and this debate proved that was the correct decision
biden bombed but i do n't know who would have been swayed towards trump after listening to that
holy shit i just watched that after reading your comment that guy is awesome
all cable news networks are shite not news anymore it ’s just opinions and arseholes just give me the facts and some basic analysis and let me make up my own mind
they missed the shittiest part literally skip to 1 16 22 and listen for what trump ’s mic picks up you might have go like 10 secs before
i almost lost my shit with that made no sense
yes they were terrible wtf were you watching they were excellent
frog vs scorpion reference is spot on nice take
he should just call what he said bs and move on trying to counter trump 's fire hose of bs would n't give him a moment to make any of his own points
this the biden campaign agreed to these rules the moderators did n't do much a robot could have asked the questions and it would n't have made any difference but i do n't think that was the biggest problem biden was utterly ineffective at bringing up trump 's weaknesses and defending his record
yep cnn noticeably changed for the worse under new ownership
her husband is part of the 51 intel agents who called hunter biden ’s laptop fake russian disinformation which later turned out to be false the fbi admitted it was in fact real the people cnn choose to moderate is insane
right like they give a fuk
i think probably people who have watched other debates colorado comes to mind the guy that moderated that did an excellent job and its well worth a watch full debate
i think they meant “ let trump lie without fact checking ” and yes fact checking would definitely have mattered
they asked question 3 and trump insisted on answering question 1 they did n't even keep him on topic like the rules said he should nyt broke down the time spent trump had 5 minutes more than biden no explanation from cnn
what is cnn supposed to do they were suppose to mute their mics and fact check them so that their show did n't turn into 90 minutes of misinformation and arguing about it
if biden called out all trumps lies that 's all it would be trump lying and biden countering there 's be absolutely no time to present any of the platform policies gains or ideas fact checking trump is a 80 hour a day 14 days a week job it 's so utterly taxing the media just gave up in 2016
then you get bs like “ alternative facts ” nothing is a lie from a certain perspective at a certain time under certain conditions we use to just call the people who were good at this a politician
yeah this was the debate terms the biden team agreed with and largely asked for biden had multiple opportunities in his one minute rebuttal periods to respond with facts but did n't could n't and often only used 10 20 seconds of his rebuttal time despite the moderaters promping him a few times to use his time also from a strictly neutral point of view of fact checking biden got several of his figures totally wrong though not out of maliciousness like trump so that would n't have been a great look either arguably less bad than blatant lying but
you do realize the onus of proof is on the one making the claim correct that 's how debates work make a claim back it up spewing vitriolic garbage is n't debate
your list is hilarious cuz it leaves out every single time he said ' worst in maybe the history of america the world the universe all eternity
listing trump 's lies would be better here are just 3 of 30 trump lies 1 some democratic states allow people to execute babies after birth 2 every legal scholar wanted roe v wade overturned everybody even democrats wanted roe overturned 3 u s currently has the biggest budget deficit ever
also he repeated the very fine people lie and his 6 golf handicap lol how stupid does he think his supporters are
i did n't catch the whole debate but at least 2 of those examples biden corrected later that i saw he said 15 for insulin later on and then quickly corrected himself by saying 35 he also later stated that the drug spending cap was 2000 that would lead me to believe that those were n't lies but mistakes i do n't recall trump correcting any of the many false statements that he made
yeah i do n't understand all the outrage here if trump was debating a younger sharper more capable person they would have pushed back hard on the things he was saying biden came in there with a memorized script and the only time he really pushed back on trump is when trump got personal people are misdirecting their anger it should go squarely on their candidate period
i agree with your take it was biden 's job to call him out for lies
r politics will always be ok with a dem lying
it 's all over the internet
well keith olbermann big mad about it
yes he 's obviously lying eg when he says literally impossible things eg millions of immigrants from prisons and mental institutions are flooding across the borders they know he 's making that up and they do n't care you have to think about why they do n't care people generally forgive lies that they think are well intentioned similar to white lies if they think the intent behind it is right they see it as just pedantic and nit picking to get hung up on details of it like if a left wing person says that post birth abortions never happen and then someone finds an actual case where a non viable baby is born breathing but not able to survive and allowed to die you 'll say well that 's not really a lie right everyone knows that was n't what they meant so if trump says millions of people from prisons and mental institutions are flooding across the border maga supporters hear bad people are coming and you are not a bad person for worrying about that if you start blabbing on about the fact there ca n't possibly be millions they will just hear that you are obsessed with pedantics and do n't care about their concerns
the real fucked up world washington
there ’s got ta be a broken hip somewhere
what biden has done if this is rigged then i 'm all for it
i have been saying this for years does anyone actually know what trump is running on congress needs to fix the border which he failed to get them to do in his first term he is just as much responsible for the inflation that occurred which no longer is an issue unfortunately most people are this stupid if maga rinos cared about issues they would have voted for haley or desantis they at least have actual platforms
whoever prepped him was horrible and should be fired most people working in the dnc seem completely out of touch with americans
the dems do n't play the game the game is beneath them they 'd rather lose than play
i ponder if they had enough dry runs
bing bing bong yo democrats can you hire a debate consultant who knows how to actually win try pineapplemean1963 i mean it was so obvious but the dems are like “ we trust the voters to care about the issues “ at a wwf event
biden needed to start every answer with trump is a pathological liar and nothing of what he just said is true it forces the moderators to respond to it and address it and undermines trump
it ’s not like any of the lies that trump used were new the killing babies after birth the millions of migrants invading from the south the country laughing at us and respecting only him all of these lies have been the same lies trump has espoused for a decade now
that 's all trump has ever done in debates lol it was n't like he debuted some clever new tactic
whoever thought trump would n't just lie all the time and prepped biden accordingly really needs to get out of advising biden
i think biden should have stated the obvious biden should have said “ i ’m debating explain what a debate is and explain that this guy is just spewing unrelated rally talking points which i suspect is all the information trump has left in his headspace
ok so maybe address that once “ i ca n’t respond to every point the former twice impeached felon president said in only two minutes so i ’ll only respond to the current topic ”
he should fire the prep team they sucked trump turned every one of his known issue self projection on biden every accusation is a reflection and admission everyone knew he would do this he does it 25 7
i do n’t think they prepped him on what happens if trump just does n’t answer the question and talks about something else entirely if this is true then biden and his entire staff are complete and utter idiots
any person with a brain would have known that trump was not going to answer a question if he did n’t want to and he was going to use all his time to his advantage to talk about things that make him look good regardless of the question in a debate specifically structured like this where speaking time is limited it is kind of mind boggling that anyone in the dnc or his campaign not really political i do n’t really know did not prep biden for any of this they also knew the rules before hand that live fact checking was not happening so obviously candidates are going to lie thing is every election debate candidates just lie for screen time it ’s sad but in todays world if you are watching a debate for actual information on things like foreign policy or some shit you are better off sticking a plugged in toaster into a bathtub i think the dnc really blew it
you just reminded me that biden seems like mccain debating obama trying too hard to remember the talking points and not being himself the debates convinced me to vote obama over mccain and this was a major factor in that decision after mccain 's concession speech i remember thinking where was this guy this guy could have won but he sure as shit did n't show up until now so biden needs to drop all the talking points and be himself hell i was thinking the same thing about biden 's remarks today where was this guy last night
younger biden will eat trump and i 'm not talking about him in his 40 's 10 years younger biden will grind trump savagely trump virtually gave tons of ammo for biden to swing but he miss it it 's so frustrating to watch
they actually should have had one of the great comedians that does a good trump impressions do the prep literally just vomit up insanity in response to every question i can not fathom anybody doing serious debate prep i e someone in the political sphere inside the campaign being able to faithfully recreate the conditions that biden faced it was clear he did n't know how to respond the answer is you do n't
can we just stop lying to ourselves they both fucking sucked let ’s try to get through the next 4 years and move the fuck on never looking back
biden was confused for what seemed like half the debate it was painful to watch trump was a lying word salad but unfortunately the lying word salad sounded more firm and youthful than biden
so what you 're saying is that donald trump the guy who has been in the political eye for the last 8 years and is known for going off on wild tangents filled with lies might go off on wild tangents with lies and the leader of the free world the man at the head of the united states of america was unable to respond to this unprecedented turn of events in which trump does the same thing he 's done for 8 years because he was too surprised and he needed his special debate prep team to teach him how to respond when trump does the same thing he always does and what he did 4 years ago and because that debate prep team did n't adequately prepare biden for this possibility that 's why he looked bad you are n't facing reality biden was n't able to respond because he is n't a mentally competent candidate or leader you 're inventing excuses to avoid the inevitable harsh light of reality
why the fuck they did n't have him say in response to basically anything trump directed at him i 'm not going to respond to an outright lie
biden was probably caught flat footed trying to parse what the fuck he was hearing and trying to respond to it maybe if he was n't a senile octogenarian geezer he would have responded to all the lies sprouted by the disgusting convicted felon and notorious con man next to him trump kept deflecting and giving obvious lies on every question and yet biden did n't capitalize on that
he got tripped up because he is so old and geriatric that his faculties just are n’t where we as a nation need them to be i despise trump
he has n't debated for more than 4 years the biggest hit to him was the democratic party not running a whole series of debates that was important because it would have litmus tested biden for one but it would have provided valuable experience to get natural with all the talking points and counter arguments since this did n't happen he went in dead cold it 's important to note that despite biden doing quite bad the first republican debate was pretty rubbish too with a lot of people not experienced either it just stands out more because trump is a professional bser he does this kind of talking every single day of his life it 's natural to him biden really needed those months of debates that would have naturally happened during a normal election the party trying to protect biden was a kind of coddling that only makes a person weaker in the end it was stupid it was an affront to democracy too which sucked it made the whole idea of campaigning and earning a spot meaningless
i think part of it too is that biden finds trump to be utterly repugnant he 's not got the tools for trump 's brand of crazy
honestly biden should have completely ignored trump and just answer the question that were asked probably would have pissed off trump
i do n’t think they prepped him on what happens if trump just does n’t answer the question and talks about something else entirely i do nt want to believe them to be this incompetent this is literally all trump does how can you not prepare for that
nope it seemed like biden had some memorized responses to trump ’s lies i think that the problem is that they over prepped for the debate they had him memorize responses to a bunch of lies that trump frequently spouts the problem is that there ’s a lot of lies he spouts i think that the issue is that memorizing line for line your responses and recalling them under pressure is really difficult to do and it ’s especially difficult for someone who has issues with stuttering it was pretty clear to me that he was mixing up some of his memorized lines with his responses for example he refuted trump ’s abortion claim and then shifted to talking about a woman being killed by an illegal immigrant trump frequently talks about incidents where someone was killed by an illegal immigrant biden probably started talking about illegal immigrants because it was a response he had memorized for a situation where trump brought up a story of an illegal immigrant killing someone they needed to give him broader points to hit so that he could improvise his own response they knew trump was going to do his usual firehose of lies they had a strategy of trying to fact check those lies which really is n’t a good strategy to have it puts biden on the defensive and it gives trump the ability to control the debate biden needed to stay out of that mess and just go “ we all know trump lies all the time he lies to benefit himself and he has no interest in helping you he ’ll sit there continuing to spew his lies but here ’s how i am going to help you ”
okay but if he ca n’t debate a fellow american facing the same issues statistical data issues etc competing with him on the fly how the hell does he plan to discuss and negotiate with foreign leaders this is like sending your grandma to the car dealership to buy something when you ’ve watched your 10 year old cousin swindle her for 20 bucks at breakfast
biden was caught flat footer are we existing in alternate dimensions or something biden was n’t there it ’s his job to call out the lies the moderators did their job keep time ask questions control mics no one is watching to hear their opinions or for them to get in an arguing match with trump
i ’m getting a kick out of watching you all pretend you did n’t see what we all saw your boy is fucked
why would biden be prepped on the questions before hand
nah biden is just not fit for the job but it ’s him or a wanna be dictator so i ’ll vote biden and hope for the best
just like trump did n't call out biden directly for getting lost biden should have just answered the questions given trump was intentionally all over the place and it likely would have confused most people trying to remember the panel question and the random shit trump has said
if a candidate needs to be given a script to follow up answers rather than be cognitively sound enough to respond real time they have no business being the president you can tell the exact moments he forgot what he has been going over for a week because he ’d ramble off not making any sense for people to actually back either of these candidates is a joke
biden was probably caught flat footed trying to parse what the fuck he was hearing and trying to respond to it there is nothing to parse biden should have not bothered to parse and point out the question was not addressed
i ca n't figure out if it was arrogance or stupidity to have biden debate trump it was a no win situation for biden you never wsnt to give trump a platform to speak freely everyone of his insane rallies is a practice run for this kind of debate plus msnbc spent millions of 's over 14 years of the apprentice training trump exactly for this kind of performance and it is performative indeed combine that with president biden who is old manages a stutter and has never been that great of a speaker anyway and you get what you did thursday night oh and when will we stop being surprised that everytime the dnc or the wh turns these things over to the msm it turns into a cluster f% k yet they keep doing it the current msm vs the old media is not our friend finally biden should never had done this debate there was nothing to gain from it hubris and arrogance maybe he should n't be awarded the presidency again simply for that kind of stupidity just joking our democracy is at stake who gives a practiced liar like trump representing a host of dark forces and a convicted felon to boot a free flowing platform to normalize the darkness he represents and hopes to spread crazy the dems seem to always find ways to mess up
do you really think that 's what tripped him i understand that the hatred for trump blurs reality but if trump was so bad this could 've been an easy debate for any solid minded person and especially the president he should be naturally ready to control any situation on stage i think the world got to really see who the current president is and if they want trump gone so badly they better come up with a plan fast to not have biden as an option trump was much worse his first debate and biden then could at least correctly complete sentences this is the first debate where i think it could actually impact the election biden did n't look well or speak well this is the president of the united states and should be able to prove he is a leader in any situation go watch some of the better democratic presidents ' debates and tell me biden still deserves to be in power after that literally depressing performance please do n't reply about trump lying they all do which is an entirely different sad reality
i ’m positive biden had his mind melt as he just could n’t get over the bs coming out of trumps mouth he knew it would happen yet still blew his mind
biden got too caught up in trying to make a response to tailored to trumps nonsense instead of just responding the strategy in 2020 was completely the opposite and he should have literally just tuned trump out
i 'm so confused why they did n't give biden some sort of uppers trump abuses the hell out of them and it allows him to have the pep he does when on stage even at his age i get that it 's not good for biden 's health but like for one night such an important night you should take all the help you can get to go toe to toe with your opponent
biden should have agreed to step aside for the next election years ago it is so aggravating watching america have to choose between these two geriatrics you deserve better from your political system
you can tell biden was n't expecting trump to be allowed to spew lies constantly for the whole debate without being muted
stop making excuses for something that is completely preventable there is no reason that any presidential candidate should be considered to have dementia period get someone better similarly if this person ca n't fend off a rabid liar by thinking on their feet probably not presidential material and yet every comment thread has people like you apologizing for this fuckery
the backwards attempt of justifying terrible biden performance will be funny for next 3 4 months at least
what did you watch the debate the only brain melt was when biden tried to explain how “ the total ban get housing for low income black families we defeated medicare ” there is nothing he is “ tripping up on ” man is senile then has the gall to say “ i do n’t debate as well as i used to i had a cold ” dude he should consider stepping down now he is clearly not fit for office does that mean trump is no but newsome or kamala or bloomberg need to step up and say enough is enough this man gave his life to the party do n’t let him die on a loss and hand the keys over to trump they need to have him gracefully step down and put up a competent leader
i would never plan to react to trump i would always plan to treat it as if trump was not even there if they planned to predict what trump would say that was a stupid plan
dems needed to put their presidential candidates through improv class their heads are buried too deep into polite political culture they ca n't fight someone who goes off script by staying on script one of the strengths of trump 's ridiculousness is how hard it is to humiliate him in front of his voters they know he lies they do n't care that he broke laws but they 're obsessed with image now it is a big risk bringing up shit like that but even the chronically online activists want trump taken down in that regard it would 've been so easy after trump 's first reply to go off script with him trump raped his ex wife over his hair both men are bald but only one has the guts to show it there is an easy connection to make between trump 's fakeness as a politician to his fakeness as a human being call him a clown a nepo baby whatever it takes to make him hold back narcissist rage tears on the stage use the traits his followers are most aware of hire comedians to come up with lines to make this perfectly blatant while being adequately subtle there are ways to use overarching political motifs while stabbing at these interests there are plenty that would 've been willing to help they see this better than anybody with a week of prep there was plenty of time to do this trump needed no prep at all because he 's already a natural at the right wing version of this
i think biden should have led with i 'm going to disregard the lies just told and i 'm going to answer the question that was actually asked
this is what happened but who the hell did n’t anticipate that trump would talk about random shit and make stuff up i mean a week earlier he was all on about sharks and batteries it ’s criminal political negligence that biden was n’t ready to easily bat that crap down debate prep ok joe when trump does this just keep saying “ well that made no sense ” seriously biden would have dominated if he has just stood there and responded to trump “ that made no sense ” over and over
in my view it seemed as though trump got around the inability to interrupt by just responding to biden during his answer instead of addressing the question whatsoever at least the anchors pressed him to answer the questions after that for little that was worth
yep the response to a gish gallop is not to correct every lie and misstatement gish gallop is so called because creationists would do it and biologists figured out quickly that you lose a debate trying to chase around explaining why all the lies are lies
if you spend all your time refuting the other candidate ’s claims you have no time to deliver your own that ’s what he was struggling with on top of recovering from a cold biden said after the debate “ it ’s tough to debate a liar ” there are so many things he wanted to correct and set the record straight on that he got overwhelmed in the moment
biden was calling out trump ’s lies as best he could there were just so many it ’s on the moderators to call out the super blatant stuff you ca n’t just say blue states are indiscriminately murdering babies and get away with it all they have to do is say actually that ’s illegal in all 50 states and there is zero evidence that has ever happened and move on instead the “ news channel ” is allowing the propagation of lies some news huh
i mean i think it 's pretty obvious in hindsight but they should n't have done a no win scenario debate
that ’s completely true i remember all the posts over the past week saying oh this is how trump is going to bow out yada yada and now after biden essentially humiliated himself and the country everyone is saying he should n’t have agreed to the debate
i never heard of him makes me happy to know there are still well informed journalists out there that will challenge people on bs reminds me of tim russert from meet the press chuck todd really did n’t live up to that standard after russert died
he ’s in denver we will gladly make him available
chris wallace is solid despite working for that network i 'm happy to watch any interview he conducts he reminds me of the good old times when i could disagree with conservatives but still respect them
who cares all politicians lie
this is my new favorite website
and he moves his lips when he is reading
spezsuckssamaltman got her panties in a wad over a title kim jung hung around trumps neck then blocked me google the word you dense cabbage
they got bought out by a trump sycophant how is this not more known oh right they 've successfully bought up all the news organizations and think if they can control all the media people will just go with it completely forgetting the internet exists i bet they come for the internet next only registered republicans get to use it
i watched cnn yesterday i thought biden was in poor form but i was kind of shocked by the analysis afterwards where they were being hyperdramatic saying he needs to drop out now whilst completely disregarding the fact that the other person in the debate dodged every single question and just straight up lied through his teeth the entire time trump definitely spoke more clearly but often made no sense as well it just seemed very uneven to me and the way they talked about biden seemed a little alarmist
thank john malone and david zaslav for that
will the next debate be better from a moderation standpoint i think it 's abc who is doing that one do n't know shit about us media corporations
this was kind of my take away the most shocking part to me was that biden 's team asked for this debate and then let him present himself like that like he 's supposed to be surrounded by campaign people that analyze everything he says right how did they think it would be a good idea to put him on a debate platform when it is legitimately difficult to understand what he is saying sometimes
maybe biden did n't think they 'd let him lie nonstop
i 'm tired of the pundit class they do n't add value to the process at all
van jones you mean the democrat that was calling for joe biden to step down which joe biden doing that would hand the presidency to trump considering where we are in the election process so we have democrats on cnn that are calling for trump to be handed the presidency you know i might think it was innocent except that there was legitimate russian propaganda that was effectively the same thing it was that walk away guy who was supposedly a democrat his whole life but supposedly the democrats did something they did n't like so he was walking away from the democratic party so it 's the exact same thing donald trump can do anything he wants and it 's cool on cnn but joe biden has a bad speech and the democrats on cnn are walking away give me a break i am not dumb and i can see what they did there if anybody reading this legitimately thinks that cnn has any credibility what so ever after that they are badly mistaken cnn is just bs now apparently it 's just theatrics and stunts so there was the bait and switch scam thing where i was expecting a well moderated and fact checked debate so i took time out of my busy life to actually watch the debate and my time wasted by cnn that will never happen again i am done with cnn they should be ashamed of themselves especially van jones that was an absolute disgrace and his acting was not believable at all but that 's what you get on cnn now it 's a bunch of drama and complete bs it 's a place where liars are rewarded with pats the on back and the truth does n't matter anymore because money
pbs newshour is what i usually watch due to their reporting too
cnn did n't abide by the rules they ditched them a few minutes into the debate
it 's easy to see where the time came from trump did n't answer the question in two minutes cnn asked him the question again and gave him another two minutes to answer he rambled on the same way happened more than once instead of getting cut off for being off topic they gave him more time to do so
biden continuously did n't use all of his alloted time
that 's not a presidential debate that 's an interview with a tv host
also from a strictly neutral point of view of fact checking biden got several of his figures totally wrong though not out of maliciousness like trump so when trump tells wrong information it is lies when biden does the same it is not out of malliciouness
i 'm generally in agreement with biden needing to have been more aggressively rebuking the lies but let 's be honest here trump is fucking broken fire hydrant level of lies coming out all at once i 'm not old and generally quite sound of mind and yet even i would have difficulty keeping up with the 79 topics he rambled on about in the previous response he was lying so rapidly i would n't even be able to sensibly note on my pad how to formulate a sensible debunk response and by the time i had finished whatever i came up with i 'd have no time left to answer the god damned question trying to tell the american people what i 'm going to do in my second term we need rules for these things not just guard rails because otherwise a debate is just completely pointless if one candidate does n't ever need to say anything that 's actually true
100 % agreed on all points
yes that ’s literally why they get a minute response to rebut refute the other candidates claims and reenforce their own biden just blew it beyond belief it ’s not the moderators fault not the networks fault not trumps fault it ’s his own fault he was pathetic and it makes him look even more feeble when people are claiming the moderators should have stepped in and debated on his behalf
that ’s the best source there is good internet got ta believe it
do n't forget how good the water was under trump the water was so much better
because they are out of touch with americans they all live in their little dc bubble and have no clue what life is like outside of it
i do n’t think we can lay this at the feet of the people who prepped him clearly they told him to keep his eyes open and his attempt at that were weird moments where he was holding his eyes wide in a strange manner he almost forgot to look at trump when he delivered the punch line to “ the only felon is the man i ’m looking at ” or whatever the line was they even gave him cheek fillers ffs as a woman in the beauty industry you can see it so clearly they prepped him as best they could grandad should ’ve voluntarily stepped aside and let someone capable take the reigns before it got to this point everyone who ’s been claiming he ’s got this he ’s not too old he ’s lively and alert behind the scenes those are the folks who are out of touch and need to be fired they misled us to this disaster
well americans are out of touch with facts and common sense so that tracks
yeah it ’s his advisors fault that he ’s senile come on
hahaha no they play a different game sometimes that game is in favor with the public other times it is not
i think he was over prepared should have done what trump did and not answer the questions just keep pointing out the convicted felon and his lies
blaming pelosi for jan 6 was a new one i ’d have the same expression if i had to hear that and my mic was muted
nah the whole heartedness of the lies were new like he would say he heard stories about that or a supporter told him post birth abortions happened or he read about it now he was screaming that they are real and they happen in dem states only the all legal scholars without exception agreed that we should overturn roe was new due to the completeness of without exception that is so obviously not true and yet he felt compelled to insist it all the same kind of lies but to a new level of facts are whatever we want them to be
exactly the bullshit he was spewing has been repeated over and over again all across right wing media for months and years like my 26 year old stoned ass sat here and called out the tv debunking his lies better than biden did joe even missed some easy set ups trump gave him trump went on and on about the border being horribly dangerous and all biden had to do was talk about how his border patrol has more drug seizures and less illegal crossings than the trump administration
yes he has repeated these lies over and over and the more he says them confidently his followers believe him he is truly a pathological liar
i agree this should 've been an easy debate for the democrats and biden they knew the exact type of punch that was coming and somehow still got knocked out i think this will force the democrats to quickly replace biden i am an american but am living in spain spain is very left but the main news here has been bashing biden very hard he has become a joke to other democratic countries the democrats could still win with a last minute extreme plan but the danger of trump winning is very real and is probably even more real you want to beat him stop finger pointing make a real plan and really try and save the country because it has n't gotten better
oh for sure he should have been like get a load of this convicted felon anyway here 's what i would do on x
they over prepped him on facts and figures biden 's never been a detail guy he 's been someone to look into that camera and say this guy is going to fuck up your world i 'm here to stop it he needs to be that guy
yeah its unbelievable that the dems brain trust spent supposed weeks preparing for that and then gave away an easy win it makes you wonder how bad it would have been if they had n’t prepared they should all be fired and replaced with the toughest pr team in the planet right or wrong they should have known in politics it ’s better to look corrupt than weak
also why does this even need prep an average politically aware person could have gone up there done better than biden at calling out trumps bullshit
maybe i think in past debates trump actually answered the questions he did n't even do that he just used his time to rant about border issues and not much else
there 's no teleprompter or written speech in a debate
for sure get the biden from the 2012 vp debate out there i remember everyone was like biden wiped the floor with ryan and obama got his ass beat to romney weird flip there and i recall people were really sticking it to obama for losing
well guess what we ’re not in 2014 this is 2024 new problems and we need a new person to lead instead of someone who ’s senile and 81 and has a melted brain dude did n’t even know how to form a sentence lol
it is n't because he is mentally incompetent it 's simply because he us 80 odd years old in an extremely high pressure job an he has got to old to do it but if you think trump would n't make himself the richest man in the world an fuck everyone over if he becomes president then that 's up to you just look at his business dealings in the past 20 years has bankrupted so many companies an walked away with the money an left the little people to pick up the pieces 4 casinos he managed to bankrupt 4 in law vegas were the gambling capital of the world he is n't even allowed to open another one because of his dodgy practises him an his whole family see becoming president as the ultimate negotiation tool the corruption that will come from him being elected will make putin look like an ameter he does n't care what he says or who he hurts as long as he gets his the most laughable thing is trumpets saying he would be unbribable lol he is already putting the feelers out to the big oil company 's unreal
i mean that 's our choice someone who 's admittedly geriatric and too old to run but will at least probably have a good cabinet of advisors or trump and the raw sewage he 'll be pumping into the courts
you do n't think you could figure out likely questions for a debate lol
while the questions are technically not known to the candidates in advance it 's not exactly a mystery what they 're going to be it 's going to be a mix of current hot button political topics and big issues that the candidates have to address they pay people literally millions of dollars to do the research and planning for debates like this
yea trump ’s pupils were dilated biden needs something give him like 5 cups of coffee or an expresso or something lol
it 's well known that people with a stutter can be tripped up when their train of thought is broken that was trump 's plan in 2020 to interrupt biden and make him lose his train of thought seems trump was more successful in doing that last night with his firehose of lies
not talking candidates but trump ’s team really outplayed biden ’s team on this one by accepting all the initial terms proposed by biden ’s team without trying to negotiate even a single item pretty much forced biden into a debate that really did n’t play into his strength at all the cutting off microphones sounded great in theory but that was probably viewed as such a blessing to trumps team same with the no crowd and hands off moderation
i do n't think the moderators should have live checked i think the bigger flaw is not having the candidate stay remotely on topic it made it confusing to watch as a viewer it was n't fair to the debate having to respond to several unconnected topics at the same time is not reasonable or meaningful in any way
problem is that they want to seem neutral so they avoid getting called propagandist like for fucks sake you do n’t even need to “ ask them hard questions ” you can literally say after they answer the question “ actually xyz was done ”
he is certainly a state treasure my favorite thing he ever did was probably the rant about people 's patio photos during snow storms lol
you 're right it definitely should be talked about more that is at it 's core the reason for the change in message recently
same thing with all this online discourse about the debate most people seem to be harping on the “ stage presence ” instead of what actually matters the substance of the arguments and policies made biden ’s brain fog moments were cringe but when he was speaking clearly there was substance behind his words if this were a high school debate competition the judges would have torn trump to shreds and declared biden the winner it ’s a really sad state of affairs when the high school debate club has higher standards than the us presidential debate
then he is an idiot why would he think they would n’t let him do that
sunlight just do n't disinfect like it used to
and frankly they 're freakin ' yucky i did n't realize how much the overly practiced stylized made up lowest common denominator aspect of their presentation really bothered me until john oliver the and now this montages where you get the same talking point said a dozen times by a dozen different people that all look talk and emote the exact same literally make me sick to my stomach as funny as they can be sometimes buncha d list wannabe actors with note cards and stale one liners all
there is no more journalism just punditry “ analysis ”
his pearl clutching antics have made me despise him complete main character syndrome
it was the night trump finally became presidential per van jones probably
my reaction to the debate i watched the entire thing live before seeing any commentary is that joe biden is going to lose and that this is the most disastrous debate performance of all time to be clear i am a progressive and will be voting d but biden literally seemed like he could n't speak a single coherent thought i get he had a cold or something but people do n't care about that they may not vote for trump but they will just not prioritize voting unless there is another debate and biden performs a sotu level performance he 's cooked even that might not be enough since people who saw the first might not watch the second also i doubt trump will even do a second debate since he has nothing to gain by giving biden a chance to recover
dude cnn screwed that up incredibly badly
they all live in their little dc bubble it 's more a bubble of wealth than it is of anything else they are all very wealthy individuals dems and republicans both are but republicans actively seek to take more and more from everyone and everything while the dems are not as overtly greedy but will still take money when offered
neither does trump except for pandering to racists and to those who idolize him for being a rapist
and they just tell us plebs “ that ’s not how it works ” well duh it works how you say it works it their way sucks
some responsibility should be laid at whoever prepped him they clearly tried to have him answer each question with a few points in some linear fashion talk about playing to weaknesses they should ve identified a few key points or 1 point on each issue and just hammered on those do n't grt lost in detail now that said yes it was unequivocally a horrible performance by biden he was only saved by the fact trump did nothing but ramble and lie i do think same as you it wouldvr been better if he 'd said he was n't running for a 2nd term but i can see why he did given he was the incumbent and has actually done a pretty good job as president as to your jab at him being lively behind the scenes by all accounts he is he held a rally yesterday and thr difference was like night and day what the campaign has to do now though is stop pretending he 's not old show some humility and make it easier for people to see past thr age by saying a vote for president is not only for the president but for the entire administration
i think they gaslighting him too much just look at the after debate party no one keeping it real on his team
i missed that i was fuming that trump kept repeating it and it was n't being addressed
this was a gop talking point days after the attack too all i ’m saying is that with the expertise biden surrounded himself with prepping for the debate they should have ran through how to debate a well documented pathological liar
republicans have made that claim a few times it ’s utter nonsense
trump has been doing this for a while except for when he mixed up pelosi and nikki haley during one of his many senior moments amazing how if you yell and lie with vigor people do n't catch you are mentally deficient
what 's up with that conspiracy it was really common in conservative subreddits i saw as well
if i were biden this is my closing statement donald trump is a convicted felon a liar a sexual abuser and most of all a traitor to the united states of america he does n't care about you and he does n't care about me donald trump only cares about donald trump he 's running for office again because he knows he is in serious trouble with the law and if he wins you bet your ass he will pardon himself if you elect this man into office again he will completely destroy democracy he 'll destroy our alliances over seas he 'll make life even more difficult for the working class and he 'll assist one of americas biggest enemies in russia we can not allow this to happen or something along those lines
it 's not an easy win when your candidate has the cognitive ability of a 4 year old blame the dems for having him on stage and in the presidency in the first place do n't blame the debate prep
you still need to practice these things especially if you 're going up against someone who typically will have debated other people in the primary so they have their talking points down you also only have a set amount of time to make your point got ta make your pitch hit within the time frame
pretty naive take debating takes hours of practice and drilling so you do n't end up like a deer in headlights whatever amount of this they did either it was n't enough or biden was n't capable of pulling it off in the first place
1 to romney correctly identifying russia as our greatest geopolitical foe
obsessed with youth and vitality hyperbolic do n't need to be obsessed with youth to prefer your president to not sound and look dying on stage
avg white male life expectancy in the us is around 76yrs old biden and trump are both above that biden will be a decade past that number at the end of next term the odds are not on either candidates side i 'd hardly call that being obsessed with youth
yea that 's what i assumed was also supposed to be one of the points of the muted mic they should have been cutting him off and repeating the question i think only 1 time all night the hosts asked trump a 2nd time to answer a question then proceeded to tell him he can say whatever he wants like wtf
friendly reminder that he was part of obama 's inaugural administration and also the first person he fired
unless there is another debate and biden performs a sotu level performance his speech was fine go watch it edit his speech the day after edit i 'm being serious here what is going with cnn is wrong people need to be fired over what happened there what they did is not okay that is n't acceptable behavior they lost all credibility and i think it 's permanent because they 're not able to correct it at this point people need to just move and stop watching cnn it 's just garbage now what they produced was an absolute abomination that was truly terrible the aftershow was certainly the most dishonest show ever to be aired on cnn it was an absolute disgrace shame on them that was absolutely disgusting a circular firing squad beating up an old man trying to do the right thing for his country i hope they 're proud to be a part of that i actually feel like it physically hurt me to watch that
objective truth is hard to see when subjective goal is entertainment journalistic integrity should help but the will was beaten out of that horse before the life and death
are you saying they should ’ve just muted trump and let biden say whatever he wanted
yes wealth because they have no concept of what it ’s like for middle class people but also they have no idea what it ’s like in rural and suburban areas outside of major cities my nyc friends literally ca n’t comprehend the thoughts and feelings of people in trump farmland ca where i grew up
his racist sexist and homophobic base is likely shrinking faster than the republican party the barrage of polls usually speak percentages rather than numbers it 's hard to believe that in a country with universal k 12 education and expanding internet access people can remain so apprenticed
to be fair he quietly mumbled it
i ’m not even sure one can debate such a liar
only problem is you ca nt argue with a narcissist the best thing to do is to completely ignore them and its damn hard ignoring trump
the format did not favor biden dude needed a minute just to address and refute lies let alone state his position and trump took full advantage the moderators knew beforehand that trump is a liar and they should have prepared for that this country 's media atmosphere is so fucked we 'll run long for an nfl game that goes to overtime but the debate between potential world leaders is on the strictest of schedules
yup and there 's even plenty of footage of trump getting pelosi 's name wrong and actually blaming nikki haley instead cos he 's a fucking idiot
that pelosi was in charge of security and failed to prevent the riot and the failed to act to quell the mob once it began it 's been debunked a hundred times over
suggested edit he is not being convicted of all these crimes because he is running for re election he is running for re election because he is getting convicted of all the crimes he committed
neither trump nor biden debated in the primary
i 'd love to see people who say you do n't need prep actually have to debate someone like trump sure biden is n't in shape to debate as well as many politicians could but it 's naive to assume the average person would n't shit their pants remember the dog walking moderator that decided to go on fox news that 's what the average person would look like
or it was too much i get the impression that biden had a head full of facts and figures that he felt compelled to remember and recite when none it was necessary
hell just go back and listen to biden ’s very first answer at the start of the debate as i was watching it live the second thing i noticed immediately after getting over how his voice sounded was that he was rattling off his talking points so fast that it was obvious that he was memorized to the fucking hilt
well a broken clock and all that
i think the word you 're looking for is stupid
it 's like trying to play chess against a pigeon the pigeon knocks the pieces over struts all over and shits on the board and acts like it won
yeah it 's actually a well known technique of bullshitting called a ' gish gallop '
humor you mock and degrade someone like that for some reason liberals are just unable to do that
honestly in retrospect hillary did n’t do that bad
it ’s really not a debate just a platform for him to spew bs
the format literally benefits gish galloping liars 2 minutes to answer with 1 minute rebuttals this grossly benefits spewing out loads of lies and one liners that your opponent now has to address but with less time it really feels like cnn was trying to benefit trump
which was utterly bizarre to me because the dnc set the rules and format all i read in the weeks leading up was how trump was going to drop out because the rules were all against him what happened
the moderators knew beforehand that trump is a liar and they should have prepared for that they did prepare for it this was by design
this is the format biden ’s people asked for the fact people are wondering if they ’re watching real time elderly abuse unfold is a statement on the dem candidate
that is a perfect analogy thank you for that
we all knew he ’d do it cnn needed to actually moderate the debate and shut down the lies they did n’t cnn aided and abetted trump it ’s wild that people who think a person who lied through an entire debate “ won ”
i forget where it happened but there was a political stunt like 10 years ago where the left candidate just brought out a lie jar put it up on the podium and every time the right candidate would lie they 'd loudly drop a coin in it completely destroyed their concentration and undermined them every time they made shit up all without having to utter a word if even a single democrat had the balls to do this their opponent would actually just have a complete meltdown especially if it were trump
when they go low we go high has worked out so well
she did n't voters were overconfident i still remember hearing someone from a swing state call in to npr saying they supported clinton but voted trump because they wanted to make it close the woman 's rationale was that if clinton felt like it was close when she ran against the crazy guy she would n't think she had major mandates
i believe this behavior was attributed to trump when he first debated hillary clinton
dems always bringing a knife to a gunfight
uhhhh why do people have to make something so plain and simple complicated
a handful of people in michigan more or less sabotaged the election in 2016
wow that woman deserved the 4 years of hell she got under trump
but it 's also the fact of presidential debates looking presidential and exuding confidence is more important than having good answers campaigning is an entirely different skill than debating neither have anything to do with actually governing i think it may have been farron cousins from farron balanced or sam sieder from the majority report that talked about real synthesis being when the president has a cabinet and a war room to manage a crisis would that be something to see tabletop a disaster with their cabinet in 30 minutes and present an action plan
because people are fucking stupid
tragically she has n’t enjoyed much since the leopards ate her face
same guy who said you 'd have to pick between being electrocuted or eaten by sharks if your electric boat sinks
trump does n't have to be coherent he only has to be about as coherent as his fans and that is an extremely low bar
but he ’s not an imbecile right and the magasses really are n’t dumb right
it is remarkable to see how somebody could have an anti science stand we have an energy problem in this country for a moment let ’s pretend that climate change did not exist that the air was pure no pollution now solar panels producing electricity which is cheaper per kilowatt hour then what the utility company charges you the very simple used case is that these panels are on every roof in midwest states like texas arizona new mexico when you need power the most the sun is literally shining the brightest and will take much if not all of the load off the grid this will save lives because of power outage can be deadly to the elderly or people who just need to be in a controlled environment if we stop right there what is the objection every word i just wrote is not partisan nor is it science fiction even in the winter if this technology were in place texas would have avoided much of the disaster when their entire grid collapsed in one of the storms a few years ago if none of this can be understood by elected officials then they certainly do n’t understand the need to help support technology for energy storage i am not a chemical engineer and ca n’t even guess what that technology will be but i keep reading how improvements are made every day and ultimately a system to store a weeks worth of power will be available at the household level at that point it will be trivial for the grid to support the homes who ’s local power source has failed
trump has been showing significant cognitive decline for a while and spews dementia garbled mess on the daily at his cult gathering rallies the fact that he was able to somehow increase the “ coherency ” of his rantings during the debate was an anti christ miracle
yoy would think this is a joke but he 's 100 % serious
coming from the man who does n't exercise because he genuinely believes that humans have a finite amount of energy and he does n't want to waste it working out at a gym
“ dumb as a box of rocks ” is being generous
is he that ignorant or does he look that far down on his crowd
what a time to be alive literally watching the end of the boomer generation fade off into the sunset during an american presidential debate they ’re taking us all down with them is the problem here
i ’m pretty sure this one was a joke ngl everyone laughed and it did n’t seem like he was serious
you ca n’t convince me that he actually believes half of the stupid shit he says when he is n’t just entertaining the crowd he ’s triggering the libs the sad part is he admits it and loses no followers i ’ve never seen a more obvious example of a cult
one candidate had a cold and gave rambling but otherwise accurate answers and had been a good if not great president the other lies whenever his lips move is a convicted felon thinks electric planes will fall out of the sky if there are clouds and demonstrates his senility evilness and incompetence almost daily but hey they are equal
trump is n't really that dumb but he says this to appeal to his base
he thinks it 's a calculator
bwahaha or if it 's cloudy out bwahaha what a doofus
people who vote for him are going to deserve what they get the rest of us unfortunately wo n't
electric planes would be propeller based propellers cause cancer remember trump
yeah but joe biden ’s first name is short for joseph how can anyone vote for biden s
the airplane keeps flying duh
the news feels a lot like a child pulling on the skirt pant leg to tell an adult without realizing said garment belongs to a mannequin
i love the electric airplane one can you imagine the inaugural flight of the first electric plane everything is going great super powerful then it goes into dark side of the earth immediately turns off and crashes the engineers all look at each other in absolute horror “ oh no we did n’t think about night time ”
and idiots vote for this pig
in the wee hours of july 26 2016 solar impulse 2 landed in abu dhabi to eager crowds and cameras after 14 months of travel and 550 hours in the air the plane had accomplished what many had deemed impossible traveling 25 000 miles around the world over four continents two oceans and three seas without a drop of liquid fuel the sun 's vibrant rays supplied the craft 's only power
you guys have already forgotten about all the planes falling out of the sky during the eclipse
poor rocks their the real losers in this statement
as a geologist i must ask that you stop insulting rocks they are far smarter
brain of a 4 year old yet people follow smh
how has the biggest superpower on earth been reduced to choosing between an insane trump and a senile biden is this really the best you can do america
great his a dumb ass lying criminal well established but how are we supposed to win the election with our 81 years old man lost in the middle of a sentence and losing every poll out there fuck trump eyes on the prize nov 5 and for now bide is the most unpopular and senile candidate he ’ll actually push people to stay home rather than voting against trump get your heads out of the sand biden is a liability
probably trump we are going to land on the sun if i ’m elected how we land at night when it ’s dark s
same guy who said you 'd have to pick between being electrocuted or eaten by sharks the guy who believes he can steer hurricanes with a sharpie
is there an eaten by electric sharks ’ option
do n't you know apparently for cnn and nyt that 's perfectly presidential things to say
you know what gets me this shit happens at rallies but he did n't devolve into this shit at the debates meanwhile biden looked senile at the debate and the next day at his rally in nc he seemed 15 years younger wtf
i 'm honestly bewildered that i am able to write this reply in my currently dark living room 0 0 how my phone work right now
i ’d say dumber than a box of rocks
trump does n't have to be coherent he only has to be about as coherent as his fans and that is an extremely low bar what bar
that ’s why a flaming bag of dogshit would get my vote i was not a joe biden guy in 2020 but i voted against trump i was impressed with joe and thought he got stuff done and the us economy was the best compared to everywhere else in the world inflation world wide was at record highs joe got us energy independent and broke the back of opec using our federal gas reserve his stance on russia is right but the republican house at instruction of trump and putins minions held up ukraine aid
i mean he ’s not an imbecile if his base eats this shit up he ’s king of the imbeciles but that does n’t necessarily mean he believes the dumb shit that they believe or they just go along with his word salad because he ’s their guy interesting chicken or the egg or the chicken question
this is not lucid he is deranged any sane person would and should lose their shit arguing with him for an hour
people calling trump an idiot are dangerously underestimating a man who built an empire off of chutzpah and other people 's money he 's many things but stupid is not one of them
they see any attempt to use anything other than oil natural gas or coal as an attack on those “ american ” industries
now solar panels producing electricity which is cheaper per kilowatt hour then what the utility company charges you every word i just wrote is not partisan nor is it science fiction the first sentence is partisan though you might not think it is if you were a reasonable person who did n't believe corporations control our laws though
or substances would n't normally make that kind of accusation but felt he was projecting stating that biden should be drug tested before the debate
he apparently made that claim in college but continued to golf ski and play baseball with children in his family i have a theory that he went to college bragging about how he was so great at baeeball that he had offers from baseball scouts and the actual college athlete s forced him to put up or shut up
rocks have a saying for their more intellectually challenged colleagues dumb as a box of trumps
not to mention no more overnight red eye flights
there is ample evidence at this point to assert that trump truly is that dumb we should be aware of the possibility of smarter politicians attempting to be dumb to appeal to the masses but this is n't exoneration those types should be avoided just as if they were truly that dumb
and you can forget about taking the redeye out of jfk
a lot like a child using the display toilet at home depot and then yelling for toilet paper
dude i was just about to leave for work and now i got coffee all over my shirt
in the morning consult poll taken after the debate biden moved from a tie to one point ahead of trump
let 's nuke a hurricane dump2024
i think it 's deeper than that but really not deep he was wrong found out he was wrong and his ego could n't allow that so he sharpied until he was right
same guy who suggest led injecting bleach or lysol
sharks with fricken laser beams attached to there heads
this campaign has jumped the shark
it 's up to joe to point out all of trump 's gish gallop fact free vomit even though you have limited time and your mic is turned off joe did n't sound strong but at least he came to answer questions trump would n't answer even when they followed back up with a direct you have 67 seconds left answer the question
the one where you do the limbo and it gets lower
the one he sits in drinking with his clever friends
the confidence bar it does n't matter what you say it matters that you say it confidently remember to brawndo your plants i has electrolytes it 's what plants crave
he ’s king of the imbeciles but that does n’t necessarily mean he believes the dumb shit that they believe he ’s an imbecile because he does n’t believe anything at all he knows what he wants and nothing else
with money arrogance can take you very far
but he started with a substantial grubstake from papa drumpf
he ’s an idiot savant when it comes to carnival barking he ’s not smart
he has phenomenal and almost limitless monomaniacal charisma almost entirely driven by his narcissism but apart from possibly math idk he has about the reasoning power of a large reptile
bruh against a fucking lying criminal what would it take for him to run 5 to 10 points ahead run against a dead body come on folks
the scariest thing is i would nt be surprised if he wanted to try it
he agreed with the guy who says we should fill volcanoes with cement
that never hurts for sure but you got to remember that before all of the political bs he was a real estate baron known for shrewdness and cunning at his core the man has not changed and is now hell bent on a revenge tour
that kind of thinking is what will cost the democrats the election the dude is smart as fuck and good at downplaying it like bush jr playing the country yokel
i would n't be shocked that this revenge seeking psychopath would want to nuke new york or some liberal city he 's a dangerous person who could have project 2025 supporting him with lots of idiotic yes men that never question him sigh if the bastard wins we have impeachments on day one to look forward to
pretty sure he floated the idea while he was president like drinking bleach it ’s dumb but at least there is some tiny bit of science to it as it might disrupt the storm system the noaa though said it would probably have very little impact on a hurricane as well as carry radiation fallout to the coastal areas it hits really sounds like stephen miller idea to me
in fairness i want to know what would happen although ideally with normal munitions not ykno nukes ahh curiosity such a silly thing
this is the second paragraph from the nyt opinion donald trump has proved himself to be a significant jeopardy to that democracy an erratic and self interested figure unworthy of the public trust he systematically attempted to undermine the integrity of elections his supporters have described publicly a 2025 agenda that would give him the power to carry out the most extreme of his promises and threats if he is returned to office he has vowed to be a different kind of president unrestrained by the checks on power built into the american political system it goes on to say if the race comes down to a choice between mr trump and mr biden the sitting president would be this board ’s unequivocal pick that is how much of a danger mr trump poses and to make a call for a new democratic nominee this late in a campaign is a decision not taken lightly but it reflects the scale and seriousness of mr trump ’s challenge to the values and institutions of this country and the inadequacy of mr biden to confront him and mr trump ’s own performance ought to be regarded as disqualifying he lied brazenly and repeatedly about his own actions his record as president and his opponent he described plans that would harm the american economy undermine civil liberties and fray america ’s relationships with other nations he refused to promise that he would accept defeat returning instead to the kind of rhetoric that incited the jan 6 attack on congress whether or not you agree with the editorial 's call for biden to step aside the entire opinion shows they do not seem ok with a convicted felon furthermore article from the same board a month ago in which it is made clear he should be nowhere near the nomination poor article from salon
the editorial from the new york times 1 makes clear that they would unequivocally support biden should he remain on the ballot in november and 2 notes the ways in which what trump has done is disqualifying the point that they make is that in an election with stakes as high as this one we need a stronger candidate who has a better chance of defeating donald trump while i think that biden has been a good president i agree that he severely damaged his image on thursday and should step aside to maximize the chances of defeating donald trump
ratings its all its about they would rather have the loud mouth lying felon than a stutterer i 'd rather have the stutterer
this is absurd they do n’t ask trump to step down because they know it wo n’t work but after that debate nyt knows them saying biden should step aside can have a real impact
because they are paid by the convicted felons backers
ummmm they clearly state if you read the editorial all the way that biden is preferable to trump fuck the gop
i feel like i 'm taking crazy pills with the amount of articles here getting upvoted doing anything to place the blame off biden the guy looks awful and needs to go asap newsom would have wiped the floor with trump
the real title of the article is in the late paragraphs but facts exist independent of their conjured reality and nothing can be done about that did joe biden screw the pooch yep but so did donald trump
the only thing the ny times wants are clicks subscribers and will do and say anything to increase those numbers
they know trump wo n’t step down they want biden to step down so someone else can beat trump salon knew this and posted this dishonest article anyways but it ’s salon so i ca n’t say i ’m surprised with the dishonesty
it takes a special kind of stupid to think 1 bad debate performance should disqualify the incumbent president from re election no one else at this stage will beat trump there 's no one else with the same name recognition and appeal to the middle
i am really annoyed at how the media has handled biden ’s debate performance yes he ’s an old man the other guy is literally a pathological liar and convicted felon who wants to destroy american democracy look at what biden has done as president he has been extremely effective
watch president biden speak at his rally in north carolina the day after the debate also revisit the incoherent trump at one rally after another leading up to the debate the media and some people in general are too ruled by emotions and not enough by staying calm and reasoned i 'm not rattled by one off day
he 's so so much more than just a convicted felon he does n't have a clue what he 's doing his tariff plan will absolutely wreck our economy as will the huge tax breaks for billionaires people need to set aside their anger and realize who trump truly supports and it ai n't them
who pays the bills at the nyt that 's your answer
what bullshit they want biden to step down because they do n’t think he can win they are not supporting trump
if a convicted felon can be president why ca n’t a corpse
frankly this subreddit is unhinged and completely disengaged with the reality we are living in i am and always will be a card carrying democrat and i 've voted for biden in many elections and will vote for him again in 2024 if he remains the nominee that being said it is impossible to ignore the evidence that is in front of our eyes after the last debate he had difficulty putting basic sentences together he should not be the nominee for president in 2024 and has absolutely no chance of beating trump if he remains in the race this should be clear to anyone with eyes i come to this subreddit hoping for some thoughtful debate on this issue and i 'm met with deafening silence and articles about how biden won the debate despite widespread coverage of biden 's implosion and ignoring the fact that the paper of record is calling for the sitting president to drop out of the presidential race burying our heads in the sand and pretending everything is okay will not work he needs to step aside finish his term and let somebody else with a fighting chance run this race
the times is bitter that biden wo n't give them an exclusive
they ’re obviously not okay with trump they know republicans and many voters are okay with trump though and they would n’t listen to an nyt call for trump to drop out anyway democrats and voters are both concerned about biden ’s performance and will possibly listen to nyt that ’s why the editorial board focus this statement on him
or maybe they 're not ok with a convicted felon so they want biden gone
the gop have done a truly spectacular operation here this is a political strategy masterclass biden ’s polling has been very similar to obama ’s in 2012 the gop arguments about inflation were weakening this was looking brilliant for biden then the debate happened biden did not perform well cnn circulated that “ a democratic operative ” who has no doubt been paid with a very large lobbying job was speculating removing biden the media ran with that editorials followed then pay a couple hundred bots to claim to be democrats pushing for biden ’s removal then thousands of progressives who as history shows would be unlikely to vote anyway regurgitate those points until it becomes the entire narrative the gop has exploited the overwhelming weakness of democrats the one thing republicans will always have over democrats republicans fall in line they will happily vote for a candidate they disagree with because the cause is greater than the candidate democrats have never been able to do that any candidate that does one thing progressives disagree with because equivalent to trump and should be removed just look how john fetterman is treated here and they played us like a fiddle
it is good that in the article they condemn trump but is n’t that the problem they have recently had articles graphs etc all claiming biden lost or biden should step down big bold headlines about how biden this and biden that and as much as they can pretend like they are doing their part by bashing trump in the small font of the article those headlines stick and move people to look at biden in a negative light and not trump
it 's crazy how people ca n't distinguish between changing the democratic candidate and voting for trump
they seem ok with trump being a liar cheater thief rapist and most importantly completely incompetent biden is ethical and team biden is demonstrably more competent than the confederacy of dunces from trump 's disastrous administration trump is like artificial intelligence he hallucinates with authority and sounds good until you realize what he has said is not true nor does he really even believe it himself
the people calling for biden to drop out are not ok with a felon there 's not a chance in hell that trump would drop out and biden has no chance of winning now after what we all saw he needs to drop out so we can have a chance
damn salon read my reddit postings lately the media has normalized trump 's atrocious behavior since 2016 at no point in the history of the presidency has the media taken this parasitic relationship with a politician simultaneously normalizing them in able to criticize their incompetenance
salon way out there as usual why do we need putin 's respect because it 's the only thing keeping him at bay no respect means putin will do as he wishes
the very reason they want biden replaced is because they ’re not ok with trump lmao they know that he ’s going to get his ass handed to him by trump hence why they want him replaced if you read the editorials that ’s what they say
they want him gone so he does n't lose to a felon that 's what everyone who is n't in denial is saying
they know the felon is n’t going anywhere and will likely win against the senile old man
ok if biden steps down at this point the only defensible choice to replace him is harris and i 'm not sure her electoral prospects are better than his the primary is over the democratic party 's voters chose biden there is no process to select some ideal candidate at this point if the dnc foists a candidate on the party then there will be a lot of division a lot of division to overcome in a short period of time they 've been telling us since february 2020 that biden was the only one who could beat trump and that we should support him no matter what then to ditch him after a bad debate for some new jerk who will be are new only chance to beat trump wo n't be a good look i 'm not saying it could n't work but their risks either way there 's no obama 2 0 waiting in the wings to step up and yes we can us to a crushing blue wave and for those who were there obama 1 0 felt like a risk in summer 2008
meanwhile trump said he did nothing wrong yes i was very scared by this passage i was speechless with a definitive distrust for men so i understand why biden froze and someone on redit wrote all i 'm saying is i hope y' all are stocking up on birth control so i thought i could still trust america this is important yes it 's not because of the president 's name or face you
to be fair there 's a pretty good chance he 's not a convicted felon for very long also restoration of rights to felons is usually pretty well accepted amongst progressives liberals
the irony the left claims that trump is a threat to democracy but they want to replace the candidate that the people voted for ca n't make this stuff up
abc news hosts the second debate i hope they 're taking notes on how to handle trump they should institute a rule that says if a candidate lies then time will be given to the opponent to explain the lie this way it will provide joe biden with much more air time than trump and should win over the undecideds as biden hits those lies with solid facts
yes but you have to read the article to find that the nyt ’s headline makes it seem that biden dropping out is more important than anything else it makes no mention of trump as a times subscriber i get emails from them about important news stories last night ’s email was very straightforward the editorial board has called for biden to drop out that ’s it no mention of trump so your original point yes you ’re correct they did bury in the article that they think trump is a shit candidate for president and that is why they are asking for biden to drop out of the race that is some really screwed up logic right there
we are so fucked the democratic party does n't support biden on the fence voters will not vote this election and trump is going to win we are so fucked
every article from salon is a poor article from salon
yeah it makes no sense another reason why nyt would n't bother calling for trump to resign he obviously would n't and none of his supporters would care what the nyt said biden might and some of his supporters do care
rags like salon exist only to rile up people that would n't actually bother to read the article just the title
i do n’t think “ times makes qualified call for biden to step down ” is as snappy
thank you i appreciate people like you who give a breakdown of what the article is about it allows me not to give them the click and not wasting my time for a completely misrepresented article title
cory booker or gavin newsom would be awesome
people trying to justify biden staying are grabbing at whatever straws they can like nobody calling for biden to bow out wants trump or is okay with trump we ’re worried the visuals of that embarrassing debate will encourage those who were undecided or wishy washy to go with trump or kennedy we ’re desperate for trump to lose we ’re not against biden
it ’s a gamble though biden would have to choose to step down and what if he does that but demands harris be the candidate can she beat trump not sure and if biden does n’t demand her will the dnc pick newsom or whitmer over a black woman who is arguably the second most qualified candidate in the country hard to know all that to say replacing biden with someone who has n’t gone through the normal process primaries debates vetting is n’t without significant risk there is an appeal though for sure
and should step aside to maximize the chances of defeating donald trump i have n't read the article but unless someone puts forth their replacement candidate and can explain in detail how that person has better chances than the incumbent i 'm just going to ignore these kinds of statements i am not aware of any replacement candidate who is willing and ready to take the reins of the biden admin and step into his shoes should there be yes but it 's not like there are a dozen people chomping at the bit for that at least not that i 'm aware of newsom and buttigieg do n't seem interested or ready for 2024 as two names i see tossed around it 's almost july and if people do n't have anyone in mind and ready to step in it 's just divisive talk that weakens us it looks like the country as a whole has a severe shortage of ready willing and able presidential candidates in every party
people are really underplaying the fact that biden will not motivate the on the fence voters to go out and vote trump will win this election by a landslide if biden does n't drop the problem is the democratic party will pick kamala to run meanwhile she spent the last 4 years hiding and doing nothing to gain the publics favor these are all repercussions of the democratic party trying to push hilary on us 8 years ago
we need a stronger candidate who has a better chance of defeating donald trump like who name one potential candidate who would actually and realistically be more likely to win if they took over now than biden is if he remains the candidate
exactly they want him gone because they are n't okay with a convicted felon
i hope comments like this start becoming the norm i was here in 2012 and feel like this place is sleepwalking towards disaster all over again there 's no excuses for thursdays performance there 's a half dozen competent dems who would have made trump look like the fool he is and none of them were on stage post debate polls should n't have even looked close this election is even more important than the last and we ca n't risk it all on biden 's mental fortitude
who who is the stronger candidate what poll shows a better option
the time for biden to srep aside was last year the primaries are basically over and my vote to nominate him has been submitted i will be more upset if the dnc says my vote did n't matter and we are going with someone else we have to make the best of a bad situation
this biden is cooked after that debate
my issue is the editorial board did n't even wait for a day to talk it over they took a straw poll and that was it not very informative really and based on the makeup of the current editorial board many from the boston globe and news corp i am not surprised
it is not absurd what the new york times editorial board is doing is hypocrisy just because they know that trump would never step aside is no reason for them to not demand that he do so every single day he is a convicted felon he tried to violently overthrow the government he was impeached twice and they silently consent to his candidacy and potential ascension to power while the other candidate has a single bad night and they call for them to be run out on a rail
they do n’t ask trump to step down because they know it wo n’t work that is a terrible excuse and frankly just really stupid on their part we ask politicians to do things we know they wo n't do all of the time doing so gets the message out to persuade others and builds momentum i guess i should stop asking for universal healthcare since i know that it is n't going to happen in direct response to my request
they 're focusing really hard on the biden must step down part but do n't seem to have a solid plan from that point on it 's almost like having biden out of the race is all they care about they have n't thought much about the next steps or how the democrats would win after that change
what 's absurd is hauling around someone that clearly is n't fit for presidency and telling everyone he 's fine this is going to end up like diane feinstein but at a presidential level
you do n't need a subscription to read the nyt headlines though because it 's clear you never read beyond the headline
same everyone with a nyt subscription should cancel for them to issue this within 18 hours of the debate
that 'll show those undecided swing state voters
damn i bet they ’re shivering their timbers rn
please you never read it anyway because if you did you would know this headline is an outright falsehood
that ’s ridiculous have you even read the editorial they completely destroy trump but they are absolutely right that biden is not fit to be president for four more years i doubt he survives the next two years honestly there are so many better smart energetic candidates that would annihilate trump in a debate and be great presidents biden is not able to do that
do you want your news to just tell you things you agree with if news never makes you mad or questions your beliefs it ’s just propaganda
why would you even subscribe and give them money in the first place
they are absolutely right that biden should drop out yet they said that between trump and biden they would never vote for trump i do n’t get why anyone here is outraged biden is not fit to be president for four more years neither is trump democrats have to propose someone else
the recent events really showed me how democrats either operate exactly like republicans and use a network of comment farmers or these are real people but they are just as delusional as their opponents every comment supporting biden is either mischaracterizing those who want biden replaced whom are so worried about trump being elected or is basically simping over biden “ best president every ” it ’s honestly quite sad when this is the left progressive option of america
i live in ca agreed newsom would have easily won the debate but we really do not want him as president maybe
and who can beat him
they just want new explosive stories to post it would be more entertaining for the media if biden stepped down
so that is why you do n’t call for it really i guess we should n’t have demanded hitler to not invade because hey he would do it anyway
it was an extremely stupid op ed for multiple reasons but dishonestly representing it as pro trump is just starting a circular firing squad
the problem is is that trump actually went through a serious primary for better or worse republicans voters chose him people assumed biden would only serve 1 term then democrats never had a serious primary season if they did then 1 he would have actually had serious debates before this one and 2 democratic voters would have known what they are voting for and voted for him
yet they 've never written an op ed saying that trump should drop out of the race if they 're going to wade into those waters that seems like a better place to start if they are anti trump
i do n't think they are ok with trump either but he is going to be the nominee nothing is going to change that his performance during the debate was probably in line with what people expected not the case for biden the point is that for a lot of people the debate showed biden is most likely no longe fit to run for president he might still be fit to be president but running for president is an entirely different beast people who are suggesting for biden to be replaced correctly assume the priority should not be giving biden a second term it should be preventing trump to be elected and if there is someone with a better chance to defeat trump it should be seriously considered
he remains a convicted felon
not sure why he would n’t remain a convicted felon for long it ’s a state crime not federal he ca n’t overturn it
there was n't a primary so we did n't vote for anyone this time
trump is a threat to democracy which is why the dems should not risk running a candidate as weak as biden everyone could see during the debate that he 's clearly not up to the job it 's not like there are n't other stronger candidates waiting in the wings newsom or whitmer could both beat trump handily not least of all because they do n't come with the same baggage as biden his godawful response to gaza especially
abc news hosts the second debate i hope they 're taking notes on how to handle trump you would have thought that after 8 years and 2 prior election cycles of him doing the same thing the networks might have figured it out you ca n't debate a liar there is an expectation that debate participants will debate in good faith and make it about policy disagreement of course in many debates truth gets stretched but trump just flat out lies and moderators networks just smile and wave him through
this way it will provide joe biden with much more air time than trump and should win over the undecideds as biden hits those lies with solid facts that ’s assuming biden can perform if it goes like the first round less time would be better for him
do you really think trump will agree to a second debate he ’s an idiot but he ’s smart enough to know he gains nothing from it and if that ’s the only one that ’s the memory of biden the swing voters that actually decide the date of the western world take into the ballot box
as biden hits those lies with solid facts biden look if we finally beat medicare moderator thank you president biden
its not bidens responsibility to disprove a wave of falsehoods its the moderators and fact checkers deduct from thr liars time any amount required for fact checking and have an independent fact checker perform live on air fact checks
biden lied most of the time too ca n’t just blame trump technically both mostly stretched the truth big time rather than outright lie
you do realize biden lied a lot during the debate too right cnn did a fact check on both trump and biden and both told many lies
lol what what biden needs is less airtime the reason he failed so badly in the debate was because he was given so much time to talk and trump could n’t interrupt biden just ca n’t put his words together there ’s no way he ’s going to be able to coherently fact check trump in a real time debate on live tv he ’s just not capable any more he needs to be replaced
i ’d be surprised if trump agreed to another debate
while harris is unpopular in national opinion polls she would likely fare better than biden at this point i 'd be open to having another person who is viewed more favorably by the public at the top of the ticket and keeping harris as the vice presidential candidate too
exactly any discussion about him needing a replacement without presenting said replacement is just a distraction that will hurt the efforts to win an election people that base their decision off one individual appearance are simply admitting that they do not understand what they 're talking about you vote for a president based on their policy ideas decisions track record the people they surround themselves with as advisors and cabinet members and their ability to navigate an ever changing geopolitical landscape working alongside other world leaders anyone that is willing to throw that all away because of a speech impediment exacerbated by a countdown clock in one debate where the other candidate said essentially nothing substantiative and flat out lied is a fucking idiot this is n't the voice
no one has stepped up publicly because so long as biden is still the candidate it hurts biden 's chances and will be poorly viewed by the party when they run for office in the future if biden steps aside before the convention trust me that people will step up to run
joe biden was unable to do the bare minimum to fight trump on thursday night anyone else from the 2020 primary would have clobbered trump and win independent votes youth votes on climate and women 's votes on dobbs it was an absolute disaster and there is no mechanism by which we get better as we get older into our 80s the anti trump vote will coalesce around another democratic nominee we need someone new who will not degrade further over the next few months kamala or gavin newsome or other can keep joe on as a mentor advisor and we wo n't lose anyone
it 's almost july and if people do n't have anyone in mind and ready to step in it 's just divisive talk that weakens us i really hate this attitude i should n't have to delude myself and pretend like i did n't watch potus have a full on dementia moment on national television the guy is not fit for office and i think downplaying that fact only hurts our credibility the party ought to unite in calling for a bad candidate to step aside we are n't republicans and this is an excellent opportunity to remind undecided voters that we ground our beliefs in reality even when that reality is unfavorable
well the obvious option is harris if biden steps down she becomes the incumbent that 's literally why she 's the vp the problem is that harris would probably do worse than biden she 's a black woman and this is america not to mention that she has a terrible personality and a questionable record biden really screwed up when he chose her one of his many mistakes i actually think a new candidate would energize the base and voters who are less involved in politics or those who have lost enthusiasm a younger charismatic candidate would guarantee a win in november the novelty would itself be a selling point i 'm sure there are options out there but no one can step forward until biden steps aside and even then you have the harris problem she would also have to step aside and that would n't happen
i think when you compare a specific person with faults with blank slate ’ candidate the blank slate always seems better that ’s always the pitfall with these things not that i think we should totally shut down the discussion of the idea but we need to be realistic the name i ’ve heard floated the most is newsom i like him and he ’s extremely well spoken problem is he ’s the governor of california and people who are even moderately conservative often are n’t fans of cali so he might have trouble exciting the moderate working class vote ie swing voters which is a group biden does better with the other name i ’ve heard mentioned a lot is whitmer as governor or mi she might do better with that demographic although i think she would n’t have as much immediate name recognition beyond her being known as the target of a kidnapping plot i do n’t know if the sexism factor would be relevant amongst the groups she needs to win over regardless of what they do it should n’t be based on a kneejerk reaction from a bad debate result they need to give it a week assess things honestly and look at the realistic pros and cons of each option i think realistically it ’s probably late in the game to start up primary campaigns
we already have a replacement candidate kamala harris that is literally her job
newsom and whitmer are prepared to step in they just do n’t want to step on bidens feeble toes they are better matchups biden is a weak matchup especially now
i ’ve heard half a dozen names brought up you need someone under 60 who is n’t trump that wins every anti trump vote and undoes most of the republican work dragging him and his family away they do n’t have anywhere near as much cash as the dems do there are options yes this is very late in the day but this was his shot and biden absolutely spaffed it away
newsom watch him on hannity he went on fox news and debated ron desantis with hannity as a moderator and still looked great imagine what he would so solely against trump
hopefully i 've seen some comments along the lines of but trump is so bad why are we focusing on biden 's performance i think there is a lack of recognition about what the average r politics user values and what will move the needle with undecided voters or people who are deciding whether to vote at all are different whether it 's fair or not people value strength in a presidential candidate biden 's utterly frail appearance and inability to effectively stand up against trump appear weak and will affect how the people most likely to decide this election will vote
just about any democrat would be a more effective candidate right now there are no polls yet but that does n't mean we should wait for them biden 's utterly catastrophic performance in front of over 50 million viewers severely affected his candidacy whoever might replace biden would still get the vote of all folks already voting for biden and would be better equipped to win over voters who are concerned about biden 's age frailty and mental state
to be sure this is n't a decision the dnc can make it would have to be biden himself choosing stepping aside i think that he should make that choice in order to maximize the odds of defeating trump at to preserve his own legacy he 's been a great president but if his hubris to run again when frail results in trump being re elected it will harm the legacy of his presidency
they 're not gon na wait they need to sell their product and they need to strike while the iron is not news media just wants views clicks subscriptions above everything else
they used their eyes and are not in denial
they did n't need a day it was an utter disaster of a debate performance that played into biden 's perceived weaknesses of being too old to serve another term i say this as someone who voted for biden in 2020 and will vote for him again if he 's still on the ballot it was a catastrophic debate performance and there 's no need to wait for the calls to step aside
agree with other comments here the spin on biden ’s performance is confounding and completely detached from reality this debate did irreparable damage and made trump look like a viable candidate which is something that should have never happened any of the democrats waiting in the wings newsom pritzker whittmer etc would have smashed trump in that debate and would likely run away with the election that fact that the polling is this close speaks volumes and makes this look like 2016 all over again
even if he steps down it wo n’t be the day after and this should have been a private letter to the campaign and not published
did you read the editorial they call out trump the editorials in the nyt constantly call out trump the whole editorial was written because trump is the gop candidate and they want someone to beat him they do n't think biden can do that anymore
this is the same energy as ceasefire now tell hamas to surrender
they already go after trump daily but everyone who pays for the nyt already dislikes trump no one wants to pay for even more endless articles about how trump is bad i do n't subscribe to papers to read things i already know
who would you replace biden with i doubt it 's harris ca n't be newsom does anyone outside of michigan and reddit know who whitmer is whoever replaced biden would do it with months to go and the entire media establishment poking at their every fault there is also a segment of the population who will simply vote for the guy already in charge because they fear change so who can keep those timid voters while also appeasing people like you
90 % of the comments on this subreddit are people ’s opinions based on the headline
headlines matter and trust me when i say that newspapers know that there is a headline where nyt editors are asking biden to step down and there is not a headline where they have ever asked the same of trump
we canceled when the editor said that it was n’t the paper ’s job to support democracy
why did you even read it
they ’re a publicly trade company so yea they should be especially the more people do it
we are voting with our wallets against people that are okay with fascists trump is a fascist january 6th was a coup attempt
i get news from many sources a few others are paid i do n’t have to pay nyt if i strongly disagree with their editorial direction this is n’t a matter of news
i am 100 % fine with anti fascist propaganda
so make a suggestion which one person who wants the job is the best
i 'm not his biggest fan either but pete does n't have anywhere near that level of charisma the most important thing is making trump look like an idiot and a horrible option compared to the other and newsom can do that in spades
any high ranking democrat who can string two sentences together
yeah they manufactured this story and made biden look like a dying asshole in front of 50 million people in a contest he asked for blame the goddamn newspaper
is n't he going through the appeal process currently
there was though lots of people voted for one of the other candidates or chose undecided but more voted for biden
you would have thought that after 8 years and 2 prior election cycles of him doing the same thing the networks might have figured it out the networks know exactly how to handle these debates but their goal is to maximise ratings and maximise revenue drama makes for bad governing but good content it 's also worth remembering that the us 's major news channels rely on close elections to break even aside from getting more viewers the closer the election means more advertising spending by the campaigns and most of that spending goes straight back to the news channels the more the campaigns feel they have to advertise the more the networks can charge for ad space for the big channels a presidential election is their black friday the point in their four year accounting cycle where they can start to turn a profit based on all the political campaign dollars
you 're absolutely right trump 's calculus will be am i going to gain more from a 2nd one than i did from the first and the answer will be not unless biden visibly pisses himself and calls me jill
wo n’t he now be confident he can make biden look bad again in another debate
exactly these biden or bust people are delusional at this point
wholeheartedly agree whether or not he actually has dementia is irrelevant i do n’t think he does and think he ’s been a good president what matters is what the average citizen thinks and thursday was bad biden had to do one thing and it had nothing to do with trump he had to convince average undecided americans that he is fit for office he not only did n’t do that but rather made the perception exponentially worse the dementia argument is literally the only thing the other side has and they are maximizing it with the help of everyone who has eyeballs you take that away and i truly believe anyone would beat trump whitimer for one would come with michigan already in the bag
agree they have been assuring us that the criticism of his decline were overstated we all saw him unable to process information in the debate biden will not win this election i 'll vote against trump regardless but i suspect many wo n't the times editorial was well thought out
well yeah but she 's even less popular than biden and trump
i think there is a lack of recognition about what the average r politics user values and what will move the needle with undecided voters or people who are deciding whether to vote at all are different this exactly people are acting as if downvoting anything critical of biden will hide it from reality when people in swing states are more likely to get their opinions from joe rogan than any editiorial board
if only they used their ears
the new york times is a newspaper not a long time friend or donor it is outside of the role of the editorial board to privately contact a campaign to ask a candidate to step aside
the ny times is in competition with the comments sections of social media they ca n't do real informed work because that means they are not at the front of the gossip section in days before the internet the ny times would have not done this
i do n't know i 'd vote a tomato can over trump and hate that fuck but i 'm not the vote that is needed to swing the election biden just needed to show up and not show his age while debating to the degree he did i get the excuses a cold travel to europe twice last week but the guy is obviously older than last election cycle and while i feel he can most certainly do the job he is fucking old and ca nt talk like he could previously i ca n't imagine that his core supporters are that much different from me but there are a lot red voters out there that are super not thrilled by trump literally any other d could snag votes from the f these old guys crowd a private letter to the campaign is n't what is needed an honest discussion about how much of a disaster that was is
fully disagree after that debate this conversation needs to happen and it needs to happen now biden failed that debate it was his best opportunity and his job to prove to the nation that the fears about him being too old are wrong and he completely failed at that he called for this debate he basically set the rules so this is a complete unforced error on his part biden has forced the issue and for the good of the country we now have to have the debate about whether the best path to preventing trump from winning is with him as our candidate or someone else
he is wearing his mental health issues on his sleeve for all the world to see this is frontpage news across the world this is not a private issue he needs to be replaced he is not going to do it himself so he needs to be pressured
the last time that an incumbent president stepped aside at this stage in the race it was lbj being replaced by hubert humphreys the result of that race was richard fucking nixon
yes and the title should have been for both candidates to pull out does n’t that sound appropriate
these people commenting without having read it drive me crazy the whole piece is anti trump
literally anyone idk why people are acting like name recognition is an issue this is a presidential election in a 2 party system the replacement will have plenty of free coverage and everyone will quickly know who they are this is n't some senate race in nebraska idk what your point is about poking at their every fault that 's kind of the point of political journalism and they do it to everyone there is also a large segment of the population that will not vote for someone that does n't look physically and mentally fit for office a lot of people will look at trump and say well at least he 's cognitively there i do n't know in what world voters that would back biden because he 's already there would suddenly vote for trump or not vote because he gets replaced with someone not mentally deteriorating this is the only chance we have is to replace him you guys have lost your mind trying to convince us and regular people that the guy who should be in a nursing home is the correct choice for one the most important jobs in the world
i realise that but i would have thought a subscriber would have used their alleged subscription what 's the point of having a subscription if you only want to read the headlines
a lot of people seem to get mad when media outlets do n’t shill for their preferred political party
did you even read it i read it
where in that editorial did anyone state they are ok with trump the editorial attacks trump directly the whole point of the editorial is to give a chance to actually defeat trump you can disagree with the editorial all you want but acting like the nyt editorial board is siding with fascists is completely dishonest having two opinions on how to defeat fascism does not mean one opinion is fascist it means people have different opinions nothing more nothing less
you obviously did n't read the editorial if you think the nyt is in any way endorsing trump
i do n't think you 've paid attention to pete because addressing maga bullshit is literally what he does best and probably better than anyone
did n't newsom debate desantis and people called it a draw if he ca n't beat dull desantis does n't seem like he would do much better against trump
literally this it should not even be close
but they are pushing their agenda in the aftermath
yeah it matters but also he is a rapist and a fraud we have n’t even gotten to the stolen national secrets
that ’s his schtick like a job does n’t mean a thing appeals are granted on procedural grounds not likely in this case
i was listening when did we beat medicare
yeah does n’t take a lot of discussion to see what we all clearly saw
i do n't want to underscore the challenges of replacing a candidate at this point with that said there are a lot of people who are not satisfied with either candidate and would welcome someone else on the ticket and the hardcore partisans will continue to vote the way they were always going to vote i think that a stronger candidate on the democratic ticket increases the odds of beating trump
humphrey losing to nixon does not imply that lbj would have somehow won lbj was unpopular due to vietnam during the primaries and had low approval ratings hovering in the low 40s high 30s since late 1967 the argument that one data point which is hardly a comparable scenario and happened over 50 years ago is enough to make this decision on is absurd
the top post on this sub was an article titled undecided voters say they now support joe biden after debate it was based on a focus group of like twelve people this sub is for people who want to be lied to
i m not sure how anyone watching that debate could expect biden to be capable of making challenging foreign policy economic decisions for 4 more years who knows if he ’s even been making any of them lately
obviously they did not lol sigh
oh i cancelled my ny times subscription earlier because of the plethora of other “ both sides ” bullshit i was not happy with the “ no quarter ” editorial understand that no quarter means you do n’t take prisoners from the party that wants to have a dictator you do n’t platform fascists you do n’t need to try and understand their world view there are not good people on the tiki torch nazi side
he does do it well but he lacks charisma imo newsom also runs the fifth biggest economy in the world so he has the leadership credentials to boot
the context is important he was on fox news and the moderator was hannity who assited ron in bringing up totally distorted stats that would not happen in a debate with trump who is no where near as sharp as desantis and that 's saying something
fake news huh the left has started sounding like the right how wonderful
our side has already moved on from this and nobody wants to acknowledge reality and for the 94739485th time i will vote for biden ’s corpse over trump just because i say there ’s an issue with biden does n’t mean i want trump ffs fox news on the other hand will play this on loop clear up to the election so would i if i were them the damage from that 20 seconds ca n’t be overstated i ’ve spent the last couple days getting downvoted for having the nerve to accept what i saw with my own eyes and realize a candidate change is needed for us to have a shot at beating trump
you 're right we should change nominees s
but who i was talking to my neighbor about this just last night and she was pointing out that it would have to be somebody who already has universal name recognition relatively good popularity and no strikes against them because she was saying that she would love for michelle obama or kamala harris to take the reigns but she knows being a woman of color that unfortunately most people are still not ready for that so we ended the conversation not knowing who would be a good replacement
biden approval ratings are pretty bad too
i 'd be fine with either there 's probably 10 more democrats i 'd jump behind immediately literally put them on a big wheel and spin it and we 'd have a better chance at beating trump in ' 24 and i personally believe joe has had a fantastic presidency so far
i did n't say it was fake i was saying they are pushing their agenda to earn more money the explosive news cycle about biden stepping down and all the follow up about replacing him makes them more money
i agree he has as well i do n't think he makes that apparent to the in the middle voters though and that 's unfortunately the only thing that matters
i 'm not going to blame them for not being plugged in because it 's fucking exhausting
will the average undecided voter read the transcript
the transcript is a goldmine of just how fucking stupid and a lair trump is
i wish we had the post debate biden instead of the version we got that said i agreed with him when he said stuff
no one is going to read the transcript debates are a show and you either perform or not
trump was just lying non stop
“ lacked oopmh ” biden looked and sounded senial out there i ’m a liberal but holy shit stop trying to spin it there ’s no way anyone watching that can say biden should be president for another 4 years
the problem with this is that the country is n’t made up of a bunch of intellectuals and deeply politically involved people it ’s made up of people who read the headlines watch the big debates and make a decision based on what they feel at the time the average american is n’t going to sit down and go through the transcripts after they watched it on tv if your message is that your candidate actually did well but people just have to read and dig deeper to see it then you ’re grasping for straws maybe dems should stop trying to gaslight the american people and instead should focus on putting out a candidate that actually inspires confidence in their party i ’d hate to see trump to win in november
i feel like we keep getting gaslit about this it 's such a bad look let 's just look at two of biden answers in response to an easy question about abortion where trump lied so i credible obviously that he should have had plenty of points to make the fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported roe when it was decided supported roe and i was that ’s this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous and this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it we ’re in a state where in six weeks you do n’t even know whether you ’re pregnant or not but you can not see a doctor have your and have him decide on what your circumstances are whether you need help the idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying we ’re going to turn civil rights back to the states let each state have a different rule look there ’s so many young women who have been including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral the idea that she was murdered by by by an immigrant coming in and inaudible talk about that but here ’s the deal there ’s a lot of young women who are being raped by their by their in laws by their by their spouses brothers and sisters by just it ’s just it ’s just ridiculous and they can do nothing about it and they try to arrest them when they cross state lines parts of this are fine and parts of it are completely unintelligible first to me it says a lot that he did n't even use the word abortion at all nor did he mention a woman 's right to choose actually he kinda did the opposite the first paragraph is refuting what trump said about everybody wanting roe overturned and it 's the right thing to say the second paragraph says this and this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it we ’re in a state where in six weeks you do n’t even know whether you ’re pregnant or not but you can not see a doctor have your and have him decide on what your circumstances are whether you need help up until the last sentence this was going great but i have a big issue with the last bit the problem with banning abortion is n't that doctors ca n't decide what 's best for women it 's that women ca n't decide what 's best for themselves at 6 weeks women should have the right to terminate their pregnancy at will period that has been the democrats line for decades why did biden not say that here and the third paragraph is completely unintelligible look there ’s so many young women who have been including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral the idea that she was murdered by by by an immigrant coming in and inaudible talk about that i can try to interpret it after the fact but the transcript does n't make this any better it does n't even matter what his point was this is so unintelligible as is that it 's useless it 's wasted time i know people will show up to this comment and try to doctor this paragraph to make it look like it has a point but i do n't think you really can because it is completely garbled and the 4th paragraph is also a bit garbled but at least it makes a point though even reading it and not listening to it it 's hard to tell if his point is that women who are raped ca n't do anything about being raped which is true but not exactly relevant or ca n't do anything about their pregnancy if they get pregnant from rape which is most likely what he meant but he did n't manage to complete the thought this should have been a incredibly easy question i believe women have the right to choose when to have a abortion up to the third trimester at which point a doctor needs to be involved in the decision many women become pregnant because of rape and those women should not be forced to carry their rapists babies laws like those here in georgia prevent those women from doing so because they may not even know they are pregnant before the deadline has passed like that 's been the party line for decades biden absolutely knows how to say that so why did n't he i know people are going to say well it 's obvious what he meant when you see it written down but that does n't matter this is a live debate not an essay contest in the actual performance it looked like he was an old man who got completely lost on this topic a topic that should be astounding ly easy for him you can go back and try to pick the good parts out all you want but it does n't change the impression that everyone watching it live got but honestly i think the worst answer he gave was this there was no inflation when i became president you know why the economy was flat on its back 15 percent unemployment he decimated the economy absolutely decimated the economy that ’s why there was no inflation at the time he just straight up admitted he is the cause of inflation there is no other way to interpret this he wrongly said there was no inflation when he became president the rest of what he says is trying to justify why inflation is so bad now this is one of the biggest issues for americans right now for the last 4 years the democrats have been saying this is n't their fault that trump caused this inflation and that they 're working to bring it down look we can keep posting cope articles about how actually the transcripts make it better and do n't believe what you actually watched thursday and keep down voting people who point out ah it actually was as bad as it was and maybe the democrats need to face that and deal with it but that wo n't change the facts here the fact is that most americans are not on reddit they do n't care what r politics is saying they watched the debate and saw trump being his normal bloviating self and they saw biden looking half dead and they 're going to get 4 months more of seeing clips from that debate that make biden out to be a senile old man and they 're going to simply jot vote or vote third party biden can not rely on the popular vote to win he has to win in very specific states which he only just scraped by in in 2020 he will not win georgia with this debate performance he wo n't win arizona the democrats need to recognize the very real danger they are in there are down ballot races that are critical for them to win that completely fall apart for them if people are n't showing up to vote they can not afford low turnout in this election but that 's exactly what they 're going to get with biden
the felony conviction count tells a very different story the us media is such a joke that they 're trying to make it sound like trump is even a valid candidate rather than a convicted felon a rapist a fraud a pedophile and a genuine threat to national security who stole boxes and boxes of highly classified documents
there ’s a reason debates are n’t done by letter
do n’t listen to bs like this to make you feel better about biden 49 million people watched live and saw biden ’s train wreck of a performance he ’s a good man but it ’s time for him to step aside a late replacement will give the party energy and a chance at beating trump trump wins handily against biden because there is no enthusiasm for biden and turnout will be down trump ’s voters will be there biden ’s will stay home
no voters are going to read the transcripts what biden said and what he conveyed to the audience are two completely different things biden lost the debate plan and simple clinton said it best when he said voters prefer strong and wrong to weak and right
he lacked the ability to finish most sentences but one 's he did finish had policy and facts and shot down the lie trump said before that which if you were paying attention trumpy lied on every single question dodging most
they 're working so hard to spin what we watched
biden looking half dead and senile on stage definitely hurt his chances of winning against trump we ca n't try to downplay how badly he performed and how it gave more credence to concerns from voters about his health but we ca n't panic either x200b how biden acts over the next week will determine how damaging this ends up being if he spends the rest of the week campaigning with energy and vigour then his debate performance can be more easily chalked up to just him having a bad day
these headlines are sad asf
dude i watched it live this was more than a stutter you see that coming back from a family dinner and you have to explain to kids that grandpa 's mind is starting to go and to value all the time you have with them i think literally anyone else that takes his place will when by a large majority just because people want to see someone different than the two geriatrics we have now
stop gaslighting me i saw a person who is too old to run the country and handing trump the presidency
i knew from the beginning biden won on substance thanks the problem is the number of american people that do n't give a fuck about substance and just saw a sharp and angry businessman getting his points across while a confused and feeble old man at the other podium could barely keep up
it does n't matter the kind of people you need to convince are n't going to read transcripts or look into fact checking they will see a convincing liar and a confused old man and vote accordingly
here we go gaslighting us
people are n't fucking robots they have eyes and ears this cope is reaching unprecedented levels
okay that s great and all if we relied solely on printed news but there s this thing called the internet which has caused everyone ’s attention spans to decrease so that only optics matter now
thing is there are only 63 people that have read the transcript quite a few more watched the debate and even more heard about the debate broadcast
would i pick biden to back me up in a street fight no he ’s a cautious old man the kind of cautious old man who cares about people and will make moderate cautious policy choices that wo n’t get people too upset or too excited he ’s boring i want to live in boring times
this is a completely ridiculous argument biden s actual performance was so bad that americans across the country and people across the world were looking to each other wondering if the current president is even fit to serve and now people are writing damage control articles essentially saying “ no no but if you read the transcript he ’s only mildly incoherent as opposed to utterly incoherent he actually did good in the debate ” it ’s like they ’re trying to gaslight us into forgetting something we all just witnessed with our own eyes
i debated for years bidens voice was weak but he actually answered the questions and had plenty to point out in relation to them i mean if this was scored trump would score almost nothing because he answered just about nothing biden even had the wherewithal to hit on that stuff after he would respond to the prompts i thought the golf thing was a good little jab to add to the end of an answer it shows he can answer the question and also throw in a short response to make fun of trump after trump talked about golf for 2 minutes instead of answering a question about his cognitive ability i would have like to see joe do better but i ’m very happy with his performance compared to trump
like i explained to someone earlier energy trump gets an a biden gets an f message trump gets an f biden gets a b truthfulness trump f biden a the thing is everyone looked at this with energy being 50 % of the grade it ’s a legitimate concern for the left looking at a candidate that puts doubt in their minds that he can make it through the next 4 years let alone the next debate we ’re on the verge of a possible world war and we need neither a man whom projects insanity and capitulation nor one whom projects weakness and fragility biden is still the safer saner bet but how it will affect our reputation on geopolitical scale is yet to be seen
what you saw with your own eyeballs was wrong actually here ’s the real version
anyone trying to hand wave away what we saw during the debate is an idiot the cartoon bear sitting in a burning house we saw what we saw biden was a fucking zombie as trump threatened to burn the country down he stared into space his jaw slack unable to compose a coherent thought this is not a time for panic but it is cause for alarm we need to respond appropriately and demand joe drop out
you can put any headline you want on it it does n't change the fact that the transcript is also utter garbage holy fuck they 're literally counting on people seeing the headine and calling it good incredible framing though i 'll admit boiling down what happened to a lack of oomph is a strong play
keep pulling those cope strings maybe it will help
this is the denial stage i thought we were past that
yeah everyone knows biden knows what he 's talking about and trump is perpetually divorced from reality like it 's another past wife that 's exactly why republicans hate biden and love trump unfortunately televised debates are all about the superficial flash at the same time they probably do n't actually matter articulate trump is still saying crazy bullshit and will still appeal to the party of crazy bullshit disastrous biden is still better than trump and people who plan to vote for the best of the candidates we have will vote for him and cnn will continue to be insufferable
here comes all of the apologist trying to convince us not to believe our own eyes and ears for the love of god we need to defeat trump and biden can not do it
the copium in this sub is just hilarious
your impressions are wrong the transcripts are right
biden was absolutely appalling anyone trying to spin it any other way is either totally deluded or a trump troll it was a tv debate swing voters who decide this election are not going to sit and read a transcript biden failed at presenting as a legitimate presidential candidate against that orange shit stain it should have been a walk in the park get biden into retirement now or prepare for years in a fascist dictatorship
“ lacked oomph ” the gaslighting is in full swing
the transcript is similarly awful
i 'm wondering if all of this is to show he was n't on any enhancers as the gqp like to claim either way i would gladly take the coherent but mumbly over the incoherent and yelling
transcripts do n’t make a good tv or radio ad
biden in the transcript hrrgrgrgsibwjdbdjskavsh
i ca n't believe this is how bad our president really is how did he get this far along in the race
we have a choice between an elderly man who has proven he can do the job well or a lying rapist fraud who flat out lies every time he opens his mouth i will never vote for the 34 x convicted felon patriots throughout our history have died for democracy and freedom voting for a fascist dishonors their sacrifice
man stop gaslighting everyone on this i ’m pretty liberal but what i saw was two men completely unfit to lead us can we please get someone who will be around to see the effects of the policies they enact
enough with the gaslighting i should n’t have to read a transcript to feel good about the words he said reading the news feels like dating a psychopath all they do is tell me how i ’m actually wrong and that my reality is n’t true or valid now i second guess every article we know what we saw keep saying how we ’re actually wrong the apathy will firmly grasp us
does the transcript include him saying he finally defeated medicare
bullshit biden failed on the substance as well yes trump was horrible on substance but there were so many lay ups that joe missed it should have been easy to eviscerate trump did n’t happen not even in the transcript
he stabbed it with his steely knife but he just ca n’t cool the beast
a transcript that very few voters will ever read they tuned in and saw what they saw it ’s just a fact
most of what he said was untranscribable
do n't feel bad for the dnc at all they caused this shit show when they sabotaged sanders now we 're stuck with someone who should be in a nursing home
that 's great now we just need to get 50 million people to read the transcript
never watch debates always read transcripts with fact checking
lol what in both the video and transcript biden 's statements are incoherent
idk i was disappointed by president biden ’s presentation speaking style showmanship for sure but he had facts figures and data points in his responses in terms of what i want in a president i want both style and substance but i prioritize substance the argument and counter argument about biden having a team around cuts both ways president trump will also have a team but i feel more confident in president biden ’s ability to know the subject matter well enough to challenge what his “ people team ” tell him to forge a better path
he ’s fucking 81 years old should just go play bingo and chill we need new blood
biden needs to step down
let ’s let israel finish the job was enough proof trump knows nothing yes donald let ’s create even more terrorists your son in law friends netanyahu loves
nice try reddit no one in the world could understand his mumbling ass
the shill i mean the hill is hilarious we all saw the debate this damage control is not going to work if i 'm a democratic senator and my ass is on the line i 'm marching to the white house and demanding biden resign this is n't a game the dems can lose the presidency house and senate very easily
here is the i do n't see a tremendous difference i still ended up re listening to clips to make sure the transcript was cohesive i do actually believe that biden was given a stronger cold remedy than he was given ahead of his nc rally at the rally he had a more noticeable cough but was less ' sleep joe ' than what we saw on the debate stage i liked the debate format it appears to have tamed trump
transcripts mean nothing to those who watched the debate they 're just hoping they can change the narrative but i watched it with a 40 year old 50 year old and two 60 folks and all of us were stunned by the performance and it 's literally all i can think about how doomed we are if they do n't run someone else the damage has already been done now is the time to run someone else and build momentum
actually it does n't but it mercifully lacks visuals so that 's something
nobody who was saw the debate is going to go read those transcripts and have their mind changed biden looked old and fragile
maybe they could have a written debate next time
three things 1 it coulda been a potted plant debating trump and my vote would n’t change this year it ’s the one who is n’t a raving lunatic it sucks because what if biden really is too old and i ’m complicit in elder abuse but biden wants to do it so let ’s agree that maybe he ’s a victim of age discrimination instead and we should stop telling him what he is or is n’t capable of 2 far as i ’m concerned the man has dedicated his life to a country that took one son from him and provided a culture where his other son is struggling to do well he is clearly running because trump is an existential threat otherwise he ’d be spending his 80s in some other way probably in a different act of service to the nation or to his family i can respect him enough to throw him a vote 3 they talk about every one of these people being too old hillary fainted one time when she pushed too hard through a flu and suddenly she ’s on death ’s door except she ’s not ten years later how are we to believe them this time
this spin is crazy we all knew trump was going to lie and biden is the better statesman going into the debate it was agreed by all that biden had to disprove that he was too old for the role he failed terribly nothing else matters we need to move on from him
telling people what they ’re seeing and hearing is n’t reality is not a winning message the message can not be “ do n’t believe your eyes and ears ”
fairly high strength cope how many average americans are reading through the transcript
false or misleading biden claims at cnn debate only president in awhile who did n’t have “ any troops dying anywhere in the world ” 15 per shot cap on insulin in medicare 200 cap on overall drug spending in medicare border now has fewer crossings then when trump was in office unemployment was at 15 % when he took office trump wants to get rid of social security billionaires pay 8 2 % in taxes trump told americans to inject bleach during covid crisis border patrol endorsed him america has a thousand trillionaires he has the most support for veterans
as i 'm reading thru the comments the thought of reactions opinions from people in those ' focus groups ' when those same transcripts any biden or trump speech for that matter is read back aloud by oh say siri or alexa or even a real person note voice characterizations originated by are not allowed but those speeches might be interesting
yeah biden said the right stuff but also he did n’t if he had more mental faculties firing that night he would have been on the offensive more trump lied all night long a stronger debater would have challenged the things at every turn
have them debate in the morning a time when biden is fresh and trump has shown he ca n't even remain awake you 'd see a very different debate
biden lost the debate but i did n't see trump do anything to actually sway voters to his side we got below expectations biden but trump performed exactly as expected
i do worry that this is like that famous nixon debate though where tv viewers declared jfk the winner most of the electorate and radio viewers declared nixon the victory how you say something is stupidly more important than what you say worried this is some grade a copium
did it transcribe trump shitting his pants
this is pretty much why the univision focus group was so favorable to biden they were consuming the debate mostly through spanish subtitles
who cares will anybody read the transcript biden 's job was to debate and he failed
i doubt undecideds are going to be judging their vote on the transcript
there are perhaps two million people a year who try to enter america illegally if they each try it ten times trumpmath calls that twenty million people
i heard him say “ oomph ” many times in the debate
transcript or not they both did horrible like are these really our options
i ’m worried that biden ’s odd movements and faces may be the result of parkinson ’s medication this is no laughing matter he should be allowed to retire with dignity
it does n't matter what the transcript says i watched the whole thing live and it was excruciating i 've never seen anything like it in a debate biden is clearly too old and should not hold public office not now and definitely not when he 's older trump is also completely unfit to be president for other reasons but this fact does n't help biden the only solution for the democrats now is to make it clear to biden that it 's time to step down and then they should elect another candidate at the convention
biden fucked up in that debate and now he has to dig himself out of the hole no amount of analysis of the transcript is going to change that
on one hand biden could n’t speak on the other trump could n’t stop speaking
it 's more important to look good than to feel good
this is critical because every undecided voter will read the transcript
we ’d be able to right wipe out his debt we ’d be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do childcare elder care making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system making sure that we ’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what i ’ve been able to do with the covid excuse me with dealing with everything we have to do with look if we finally beat medicare
i do n’t think either of them won it simply came down to poor joe looking like someone had rousted him from his rocker at the nursing home and shined a bright light in his face is this seriously what our founding fathers wished for us
the mask fell off for a day and we are back to gaslighting lmao
televised debates are a marketing opportunity and biden failed to look like the more appealing choice to viewers in the middle this is n’t new we have known this to be true since the first televised debate in 1960
he really needs to step aside and choose a successor but all signs suggest he wo n’t do it it ’s selfish and prideful of him to refuse when he loses in november and sadly he will lose and we are stuck with trump everyone is going is look back to this moment and wish we did more to get someone else at the top of the ticket
asking voters to ignore the evidence of their eyes and ears is not a promising campaign strategy
yes he made some good points at times but they were articulated and delivered so poorly many did n’t even catch them any substance he had was completely overshadowed by the overall perception he stuttered more lost his train of thought and talked very quietly all of this can easily be construed as confused old man trump lied and said a lot of easily proven bullshit but people already know he ’s full of shit that did n’t surprise anybody he appeared more competent and confident to your average voter and appearances are everything here this is just the truth a very scary truth
is there anyone out there that recreates this with two actors reading it
maybe we go back to the 1800s and print debates exclusively in the newspaper
can they both just drop out at this point lol both are an embarrassment to our country
wild how this subreddit is trying to completely change the narrative of the debate and believe people to think this went well where are all the discussions on a new candidate
it does n’t matter it ’s all about the optics and it was fucking terrible we all know trump lied 100 % of the time but he absolutely won the debate by appearing younger stronger more energetic fuck the dnc for allowing it to get to this point they were complicit in the destruction of the country trump will bring
transcripts we talkin bout transcripts we talking bout transcripts
media is n't at all talking about trumps comment on black jobs they are coming over the border to take black jobs they did n't follow up with the question of sir what do you mean by blacks jobs what is a blacks job what a racist fuckhead
the left tries to turn this around with these stupid takes transcript my ass biden was swept with the floor
does this transcript correct biden 's constant fuckups like most of the transcripts coming out of his team do
“ everything is fine biden did good nothing to see here be sure to vote ”
i think what ’s important is the historically moderate voters will care what was said and ignore the bullshit lies trump was spewing he looked good in front of his loony supporters but not our great nation
yeah a bad debate performance is definitely worse than inciting an insurrection amirite
likely because transcripts ca n’t convey oomph or lack thereof
of course because he does n’t look geriatric in a transcript
we read what biden was too old to make sense out of here ’s our 10 takeaways
does n’t appear as though anyone else will be throwing their hat into the ring so it comes down to voting for the candidate that you back with their policies sick of the subject and the bitchfest it is what it is and none of your bitching is going to change it vote for a declared felon or vote for your value system
is the transcript on the ballot
what kind of copium are y all smoking here biden is cooked the transcript is n’t going to cover up his lies and cognitive decline i ’m sorry but y all need to hear it just because a lie is hard to understand does n’t make it any better than a lie easy to understand
the amount of projection by the dnc parroting shills is hilarious biden currently exhibits all the classic signs of stage four dementia he was stage three during the last election cycle if you voted for that stage three dementia senior in 2020 you should maybe consider sitting out voting from now forward as you just are n't capable of parsing facts adequately enough to make an adult decision
to be honest after watching many debates i do n’t recall another one where reading the transcript after was a thing
they wo n't maybe a meme might get to them spin this up in a stuck in the woods with a man or a bear type thing would you rather be stuck in a room with an old guy who talks slow or a fascist convicted felon that smells like shit filled diapers and has a history of raping people
nope we ’re in full spin mode
no but i saw a panel of undecided latino voters watching with a spanish translator and all of them saw biden as the winner by far the said it was disgusting that everything that came out of trump 's mouth was a lie and he answered every question about the border
this headline reads ” please do not believe the thing you experienced for yourself ” it ’s kind of the biden campaign platform at this point
i think everybody knows they wo n't these people are just coping they 'll do anything to try and make it seem like biden won
i 'm impressed it could be transcribed i could n't follow half of the conversation
you do nt need the transcript if you watched the debate and listened to what biden said it was in his words regardless of how it sounds why judge if a deaf person ran for president today would everyone belittle him her what about other speech impediments what matters is action and biden has performed exceptionally well as potus what more do you want in a candidate have you ever listened to a person with broken english they can construct a well thought out and intelligent perspective and yet sound irregular because they do nt have the cadence that you are used to it does nt mean they are incapable or incompetent it simply means they have to take more time to speak and some words may be missed so biden is old we already knew this going into the debate why are people so surprised by this i wanted him to bow out a year ago but not now its too late he did well and better than i could have done and better than you or 95 % of us voters could have he is nt obama and he is nt biden of 4 years ago he is still making the right decisions as potus and he has been the best president in my life time his only mistake is israel but i m going to live with that because more important issues take priority
will can i 'm not even being sarcastic the apparent weak will to read long form texts is thinly masking a legitimate lack of ability in many cases for one reason or another
who tf is undecided at this point those people are either lying or will simply not show up to vote
trumpers refused to read the transcript even when they were the ones screaming that we should read the transcript
he 's too damn old why are essentially octogenarians deciding what happens to the country
undecided voters are all idiots in this election so no they wo n't but most of them would n't have voted for biden in the first place since they have n't ever noticed anything for a decade or two
the average undecided voter will probably be turned off by all these excuse articles i could see the average undecided voter being swayed by i do n’t know a candidate who does n’t look like a lost grandpa in the mall babbling incoherently i ’m no trumper but i ca n’t support the campaign plan of run the super old guy and hope for the best we already know trump is going to lie cheat and steal but there ’s no evasive action being taken we are just going to double down on bidens super power is being old and confused it ’s like driving cross country and the check engine light turned on and we ’re just going to keep driving and hope for the best oh shit what ’s that sound i do n’t know let ’s turn the radio on so we do n’t hear it
republicans would be hurting over it if they could read
watching his nc campaign rally where was he last night wtf
that may be the case but the majority will never see anything other than 30 second clips on tiktok making biden look like a copse
he does have many lairs but is mostly a liar
but the transcript ca n’t be put into 5s clips and played again and again wish biden would just lean into it more yeah i ’ve never been a great public speaker everyone knows that but it made me a better listener yeah i ’m old now but time had taught me to slow down and make decisions that are the best solution for decades not the next election cycle or financial quarter
' lair ' the average high iq redditor
the debate watching was a good mine of how he lied i had to turn it off or i would have broken my tv screen i hate that the moderators allowed the lies
it also shows how much of a decrepit lying bag of bones biden is just because a lie is incoherent does n’t make it any better
side note is n't it amazing how quickly the reports of how badly he did on the debate went out and how quickly they were upvoted a day later were finally seeing a breakdown of it it 's almost as if some large group had a campaign ready to go edit i should have added yeah i think he did seem a little lackluster but reading the transcripts really shows the difference in quality should the democratic party have spent the last 4 years building up a younger representive yes but comparatively speaking between only these two options it 's fairly clear
post debate biden had a teleprompter in the morning while debate biden had no teleprompter at night anyone that has worked with the elderly could see biden was sundowning
to be honest i think trumps blatant lies broke him like he knew it would happen but did n’t think it would be so constant
teleprompter at least he can still read
i think we got the real version in the debate struggled to put thoughts and arguments together every other time biden speaks he ’s reading someone else ’s words off of a teleprompter he ’s not fit to serve and needs to step down this election is too important for his ego
you agreed with him that we finally beat medicare ' but but but the context ' it did n't make any sense in context either i watched it live seriously what was he trying to say because it actually sounded like he was saying he 'd expanded medicare to every single person that s what he seemed to be saying and that s nonsense open your eyes
this happened in the nl too our left leader was too friendly and looked ' old ' geert wilders was a bully and spew insults and had a member from the audience ask just the right question for him this tipped the scales hard but it was but a show and i hated it it does n't show who will be the best leader it only shows who can debate the best and you ca n't win a debate from a bully populist
yeah and frankly this headline is kinda of ridiculous if biden had oomph we would n't be trying to figure out what he said from transcripts
biden ’s team unfortunately lied about biden ’s condition and it does n’t play well against the trump ’s lies it ’s not good i am a big progressive and ca n’t believe what happened the other night
to be fair he also sprinkled quite a bit of fear mongering in between the lies
yup telling people that reading the transcripts is the best way to understand your candidate is n’t a winning strategy
the people who 'd be convinced by this were already voting biden hell or high water but to the people now considering abstaining or flocking to rfk the above does n't read as actually biden did well it reads as a panicked attempt at reframing a catastrophic turn of form
i mean what you 're saying reflects how people feel about trump to a tee except trump was never the tough guy the charming guy or the intellectual guy a lot of people felt these things about trump people went off and are still going off what they feel with regard to backing trump so what does that say about this mindset you 're trying to push it 's a flawed mindset and does n't promote critical thinking when it came to obama i remember both sides doing the same thing the same mindset you 're talking about a lot of dems wanted an alternative candidate the republicans hated his guts he had every box check marked off with regard to how he did his job and how he performed in general but people went by what they felt and still criticized him and at the end of both of his terms the guy did his job well biden will follow the same path dems will criticize him and republicans will hate his guts but he 's going to do his job well and 100x better than trump ever could
i literally had someone tell me biden is just as bad a candidate as trump because he has a speech impediment this country is going to hell in a handbasket
exactly politics is about optics and the optics last night were abysmal absolutely no chance a performance like that is gon na get the “ i ’d rather stay home ” people out to the polls in november and i doubt biden can make a good enough comeback from it to change the narrative in a meaningful way
it ’s not a problem debates have a negligible affect move along america there ’s nothing to see here just clickbait
this sub also is n't made up of intellectuals it 's made up of people who think biden does n't have cognitive difficulties after watching him be unable to complete sentences that 's not just anti intellectual that 's like sub 90 iq ability to process information
agreed this sub has been insane with the damage control since the debate it 's clear that we have a bad candidate and i think we need to pressure him to step aside as much as possible until the convention
i have a sneaking suspicion that many of these folks saying biden ’s performance was n’t that bad are coming from the right they know that having biden step aside would be the nail in the coffin for trump how bad do you have to be to get absolutely destroyed in a debate with trump yet here we are biden was that person the fact the polls were even tued going into the debate is insane almost anyone else besides biden would destroy trump on election night nobody loves biden they are just voting against trump imagine having a candidate people actually like
he lacked the ability to finish most sentences which unfortunately will back up all the right wing propaganda about biden that has been spreading since 2021 for once fox and random maga online wo n't even have to edit clips out of context for this
i ’m confused i watched the whole thing maybe my feelings are biased because i loathe trump but i do n’t get all these negative comments about the debate did i miss something
do n’t worry r politics has assured me that they still feel the same about trump and will vote for biden anyway that must mean that the average suburbanite or metro resident in pa mi ga wi and az feels exactly the same nope nothing to worry about here so pipe down toe the line and do n’t acknowledge what you see
the thing i ’m not seeing anybody respond with is that people on the left need to redouble our efforts if biden is struggling we all need to get out there and find ways to make a difference knock on doors fundraise talk to people find ways to make people aware of what ’s at stake we ca n’t just watch the house burn down and smugly say “ see i told them that it was n’t up to code ” people need to take action
anyone with a brain not most people on this sub know that this was an unprecedented disaster for biden
those people were n't watching the debate either so i 'll honestly be surprised if it has a big effect on them
yup this is gaslighting literally telling folks “ what you ’re seeing and hearing is n’t true ”
its not about attention span the transcript is awful too this is gaslighting i 'd expect from fox news not the left shameful
based on the politifact fact checking article i just read trump might not even deserve an f he literally lied on every single response an honestly impressive level of dishonesty might have to give him a z
truthfulness trump f biden a biden actually had a dozen or so pings on the fact checker mate that 's not a performance
the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears it was their final most essential command
yeah everyone knows biden knows what he 's talking about in what universe can you say this with a straight face after watching the debate this is exceptional levels of delusional on par with a trump supporter if not worse
basically how a transcript works and what it ’s for
yes but not ironically facts are real vibes are just vibes trump may have sounded confident but he was wrong about literally everything
i think it 's sad that we just seem to accept that people wo n't sit and read a transcript i understand it 's the reality but it 's a testament to how incredibly dumb americans are we are supposed to be the defenders of democracy the city upon a hill but at this point we 're more like a bunch of illiterate mutants living in the sewer we give democracy a bad name and we should be ashamed of ourselves and those of us who know it should be doing so much more to call out those who wo n't take the time to be responsible citizens
ca n't believe how far down this the transcript contains this make every single solitary person eligible for what i ’ve been able to do with the covid excuse me with dealing with everything we have to do with look if we finally beat medicare it 's ridiculous to even think the transcript matters but if someone does then it contains the above
it pretty accurately portrays what cnn wished biden had said or what he perhaps could have meant
maybe that requires us to put some effort in and pound social media with post after post with bidens statements we can either sit back and lose our freedoms or we can fight
i also think his team wo n't be in it for themselves
what makes you think biden does n't want israel to finish the job it 's been 8 months and he 's shown no sign of restraint
did that work when trump did j6 or got impeached twice the debate was terrible but the press is over playing how bad it was trump literally said he knew about putin ’s dream to conquer ukraine and did nothing why are n’t senators calling to remove trump as well every time a sitting president has a brokered convention that party loses bad calm down liberals and leftist are bed wetters if biden leaves he leaves if you believe in democrats vision for the future do everything you can to help them if you believe if trumps vision for himself help them
i agree with all of your points except i hate the debate format for the reason that it tamed trump i want america to see fully uncut trump again that 's what really reminds people how nuts he is
amen to this post your second point is especially erudite and illuminating
it ’s mental gymnastics “ my guy was the truth ” but looked old and senile and lied a lot christ were so fucked
that ’s what i think is lost on his supporters they talk like he ’s some wildcard but he is super predictable right down to his individual word use every time
you have that factoid backwards the radio audience thought nixon won the tv audience thought jfk won
how are you going to get that person on the ticket
sometimes voters get a six figure pension sometimes they do n’t
voters are dangerous there is no telling who such people may vote for is voting safe now
exactly this deserves discussion and is not a media conspiracy i ca n’t believe how many people here are telling me that my eyes were lying and i should be comfortable with a senile president in the most powerful role in the country i thought biden was coherent in 2020 and there is an uproar because we all collectively realized he has changed a lot world leaders are now realizing that biden had a terrible performance and trump is likely to be the next president for example ukraine immediately started discussing an end to the war right after that debate
there ca n’t be a conversation based on fantasy until another candidate appear then you talk
to be fair a lot of people went over the 2016 trump debate ones simply to confirm those were in fact the words that came out of his mouth and in that particular order but i do n't think that 's necessary anymore so it 's for sure more of a coping thing now
it ’s almost never a thing but useful in this specific case because accusations are flying of dementia and incoherency so yeah let ’s write down the actual words both guys said and read them and see who ’s incoherent with trump especially it ’s always been a thing though because his delivery is mesmerizing to a certain sort of moron and i mean i get how not even judging he ’s got a style and it works but actually write the words he says in any interview any rally any appearance and it ’s always a mess at best
nixon vs kennedy listeners thought nixon won watchers thought kennedy won nixon also had a cold
the undecided voters would say gee i dunno
exactly in quotes it ’s superior and meeting the moment is saying writing less while reaching the masses
yes but the spin is from the left everyone saw what they saw two nights ago everybody agrees it was an unmitigated disaster but now just a day or two later we 're pretending it was n't that bad i saw a guy who can not string multiple sentences together without flubbing his words or getting flustered i saw a guy who messed up numbers on multiple occasions and who inexplicably locks his face mid expression in a thousand yard stare btw this transcript it 's not accurate compare what it says biden you ’re going to see he ’s six foot five and only 225 pounds or 235 pounds with what biden actually said 1 23 35 you can see he is six foot five and only 223th pounds or twenty thirty five pounds well you said six four 200 and btw none of these three numbers he just verbalized are even the proper one moments later biden claims he has a 6 handicap and then seconds after trump calls him a liar says it 's 8 the entire debate was like this the transcript is a cover up for how horrific he actually looked on video
it 's so insulting they are telling us to ignore what we saw with our lying eyes and ears it truly feels insulting to me personally
100 % the dem to media food chain is spinning instead of discussing replacing him he will lose and we ’ll get trump and it ’ll be “ our fault ” for not voting hard enough or whatever
no let ’s not try and mitigate the damage of appearance for a bad debate let ’s just doom and give up the nation to a literal dictator wannabe who has a party ready to back him this time
maybe if there was a person who translated what biden said into english and i could have just listened to that it would n’t have seemed like such a clown show
translations might save biden since they would remove the whole corpse vibe
i have n't seen or heard a single liberal outlet declaring biden won he looked like shit he could barely get a sentence out but in fairness to him the few he did string together that were coherent were actually salient points and based in reality nothing trump said had any foundation in reality if biden dies tomorrow i 'll vote for whoever runs against trump i have not forgotten what his presidency was like nor the failed coup he ended it with i 'll take a good hearted old man in mental decline over a fascist any day
it 's less about did biden win the debate and more about does biden 's bad debate prove as so many people are saying that his brains are mush if biden 's brain were actually mush the transcripts would reflect that they do n't it 's not about saying noncommitted voters should actually read the transcripts and more about saying anyone who is deeply engaged and saying he 's actually unfit for the job for reasons of cognitive fitness should check the transcripts more for the step down crowd than for the undecideds it was a terrible debate but one terrible debate does not sink a candidacy see also the first obama romney debate
donny constantly lied and refused to answer questions on substance biden mopped the floor with him
i think it ’s more reducing the loss than winning
i think you ’ve completely misunderstood the post above biden did n’t “ win ” they ’re simply saying trumps was actual worse if you read the dacts
i mean biden might have looked bad but overtime donald trump opened his mouth out came a lie even when he was just breathing biden won this by default a bundle of sentient aspergus would have
biden ’s performance was so much worse than four years ago watch clips of him eight years ago and then try to tell yourself he ’s just dealing with a stutter he ’s always flubbed lines from time to time yes but he is a fraction of his former self and there is no recovery from old age would i still vote for him if was biden in a coma vs trump obviously the point is that candidate biden as a clearly fading old man is a terrible risk in november and we do n’t have the luxury of hoping for the best he must step aside
democrats are already hurting over this debate seeing with your eyes is more meaningful than reading nowadays biden looked bad trump “ did n’t ” that ’s all most people will see
they ’d be hurting if people looked at substance and not the presentation
as a republican i wish i knew what this comment said i 'd be so mad
reading from a teleprompter in front of a setting he ’s used to with positive supporters vs a debate he deeply studied and prepared for that went wrong i do n’t know maybe due to overpreparation the cold bad analysis of how trump would debate
it was also at 9 pm he 's old as fuck i 'm usually slurring my words around 930 and i 'm not even 40 yet
maybe tired from preparation i feel like that could be any of us who extensively prepared for a presentation or exam to the point of exhaustion overshooting the mark and not being well rested for the actual event have you ever studied hard for something missed questions that you actually know maybe he did n't sleep well the night before maybe he felt sick it does n't mean he does n't have knowledge and ability
sadly the debates are live performances and a large portion of the populace do not care about details and substance but is there for bluster
it 's almost as if some large group had a campaign ready to go even in pod save america 's post debate podcast the host were shell shocked at how bad the debate was and were bringing up the topic of biden possibly dropping out the debate performance was just bad no foreign state psyops teams were needed to push that narrative
dude anyone with eyes and ears saw it was a disaster it ’s not some conspiracy
this is venturing into stupid maga conspiracy nonsense biden had a historically terrible debate it ’s not doing anyone any favors acting like he did n’t
anyone who watched the debate and thinks biden performed well is either on the verge of oding on copium or just was n't paying attention he mumbled a lot and went off topic more than once the transcripts do n't really mean anything because the people who he needed to convince are n't going to go back and read the transcripts this weird conspiracy theory that biden in fact performed well and that the articles and post debate coverage were planned to make him look bad is ridiculous biden himself even acknowledged that he was n't at the top of his game and yes the articles and opinions came out fast why because they have professional writers that were writing the articles during the debate it 's not that deep
it is n't amazing anyone who saw it live would agree with how horrible it was this is n't a conspiracy i 'm getting 2016 vibes here sorry
i was listening to it on the radio while driving and it did n’t seem that bad compared to the rambling non sequitur mess trump was spewing
there was a moment about 5 minutes in when biden lost his train of thought mid senntence that felt like a big moment to me
that ’s because the debate really was as bad as everyone ’s snap reactions jesus i am starting to feel like we ’re being gaslit i ’m nervously awaiting actual polling to come out after that debacle most citizens do n’t give a fuck what is actually said in the debates they vote on vibes also i see a lot of people acting like we ’ve never seen biden and trump debate anymore like “ debates are an indication of how they will govern ” we ’ve seen both of these men govern we also see them both deteriorating before our eyes do n’t act like “ oh biden just is n’t good in person ” when he ’s been doing this shit for decades and was great in 2020 the fact is he does n’t have the mental alacrity to do this on the spot anymore and that is very worrying we need a new candidate
a day later were finally seeing a breakdown of it to speak against the grain this is how politics goes when you are a tribal bubble look at earlier years of the trump administration sometimes trump would do something awful that even conservatives could n't deny at first a lot of conservatives would be genuinely upset be like this is bad and so on and on this represents the first hand common sense response of people actually reacting to the event with their own brain but literally over the course of the day the talking points of the media or internet zealots or blogs or whatever starts to roll in and a new narrative starts to emerge and suddenly it 's like it was never a problem before the debate lots of left was was saying that biden did n't have an age problem and that biden was going to mop the floor and that it was classic republican projection trump is of course an incoherent old man and idiot during the debate everyone saw what the repubs said is true biden had trouble completing sentences mixed up his words literally said things that benefit trump this was a debate biden had voluntarily attended and spent a week preparing for at camp david if he is this bad for a debate he literally spent a week preparing for this is not a man many people would want being the key decision maker in a crisis situation or handling a comflict in the middle east infinitely preferable to trump obviously but a headless chicken would be preferable to trump everyone was like holy shit this is bad now it 's a day later the prepared talking points are starting to come through the cope everyone is like oh this is n't actually a problem and soon half the people here will be acting like nothing has changed
or perhaps this was n't grand conspiracy maybe he got obliterated live on air and people were shocked by how seemingly feeble he is perhaps things happen and the breakdown of things days lader is clearly an effort to damage control by the people supporting biden reddit is currently flooded with vague pro biden posts it 's perfectly logical that the campaign and politically engaged supporters would look for way to deal with this shitshow
i rewatched the full debate on the wsj youtube channel yesterday and also watched it live at the time it kind of seems as if his sound was muted on the original live broadcast he somehow came across much better when i watched it the second time
i think it ’s fairly clear depending on which camp you were in at the start maga is about voting for someone without using logic and reason and democrats are about not voting for the orange poopy man as a canadian i would feel bad for you all if i did n’t have my own problems at home granted canadian politics is still pretty boring by comparison
sounds like you did n't watch it live why do you need a breakdown if you did to spin what you saw and heard with your own eyes and ears come on reading the transcripts he still did n't make much sense and i agree that choice is clear between the two options but we have more than two options we can still choose another nominee at the convention we 've had plenty of conventions without a clear nominee going in and sometimes it went badly but other times they won
i keep telling everybody this shit was a republican trap those articles where prepared beforehand as was the social media response and the regular media response now i 'm 100 % sure of that i 'm semi sure that another nation helped with it as well or several they 'd attack biden for his age blame home a replacement cause some division in the party slam home some negativity cause chaos inside the party at best they get any new candidate and trump auto wins at worse the peel away some voters a massive amount of new r politics people flooded the channel and all of them had never even spoken here before with clearly setup burner accounts
most people will not be reading the transcripts
swapping biden at this point is nonsense and is absolutely target for amplification from an adversary it 's the best way to help trump if i was running a social media campaign to harm democrats i would 1 sow division within democrats 2 false equivalency 3 suppress turnout and that 's exactly the messaging
ding ding ding look i ’m not saying biden did n’t look old michael ian black tweeted something like “ well at least we know biden is n’t on amphetamines ” hilarious and true however the sheer volume tone of posts by “ biden voters ” was overwhelming i was in despair because i did n’t understand how people could turn on biden so quickly over his age in one night most soul crushing people giving in to trump because of biden ’s age but as you said last night the tide began to change and i saw that people were pushing back against the narrative the next day biden gave a great speech and was at waffle house dapping up people the internet then asked “ where was this joe ” all week the gop was pushing this biden on peds narrative it set us all up to expect this fiery dark brandon i think that was the point joe ’s objectively weak performance was a match made in hell for that narrative the onslaught of “ joe is old ” was always coming on social media by less than authentic voices but which how joe performed it definitely started an avalanche of authentic voices with it reddit and twitter are how journalists gauge how “ regular ” people are feeling both sites have been manipulated to change shape the public perception in the past by various enemies of the united states the other night we saw that create a reality that the nyt called for biden to step aside i ’m not saying joe is n’t old or infallible or did a good job thursday i am saying that the lead up and the online response after the debate was manufactured to change how people saw perceived reacted to the debate and it worked like gangbusters
to be very honest i rewatched the whole thing calmly and his actual words message are n’t even that bad he had a horrible delivery but if someone just listens i found it very obvious to follow biden ’s points to me it is clear that the strategy was call out trump ’s lies when he said them but instead of using all his time to fact check move on to talking about what his admin did and he did he cited policies they ’ve implemented changes they ’ve made initiatives started from a content point of view i think his debate strategy was actually good he focused more on why you should vote for him as opposed to why you should n’t vote for trump it is a shame that in most commenter ’s eyes his fumbly speech overshadows a pretty clear message bad performance but not as catastrophic as people are making it out to be
that ’s because his live performance was awful it was not artificially amplified people are and were very disappointed
sadly the transcript wo n't matter and the dem spin machine is too slow as always
yeah i 'm sure the nyt editorial board is in the tank for trump please get real these are the kind of baseless accusations i 'd expect from trump 's side
little lackluster is an understatement of the year trying to convince people not to believe their own eyes and ears when it comes to biden 's performance is the dumbest possible political strategy
the country is n't ready for a gay male president right now way too many homophobes on both sides buttigieg is next in line imo maybe next cycle
what ’s amazing is the levels of blue maga denial
i think the main thing that gets overlooked is that i do n’t need biden to make many independent snap decisions i do n’t want to elect a dictator who acts impulsively and rejects expert advice biden is a rational man who will work with others trump is a childish petulant narcissist
i never thought i 'd see democrats becoming just as or more delusional than trump supporters but here we are do n't believe your lying eyes and ears biden did great
it was a highly anticipated event and biden gave us the nightmare scenario that all dems have been fearing it is n't some big conspiracy
lebron james putting up 15 points is a little lackluster ’ this was closer to james scoring 30 points for the opposing team
i do n’t think this is some republican psy op i think most people were just horrified by biden ’s performance this is also the age of the internet where memes can get made and go viral one minute after an event happens
i also still do n’t know his stance on abortion like the only topic that matters here even with the transcript
article is pure copium the dems really outjerked themselves here
i may not vote for biden but i read the transcripts and thought it was obvious how much more intelligent biden is compared to trump there were some moments where biden was incoherent and struggled to maintain his train of thought but trump sounded like an angry 3rd grader i think part of the problem beyond optics is that democrats have high expectations for their candidates whereas republicans only care about winning no matter the cost they 'd nominate hitler if they thought it would help them win
it ’s not a mindset that i ’m trying to push it ’s just observing reality you ’re arguing from a place of what things should be like and i ’m arguing from a place of what things are actually like would the world be a better place if everyone thought critically did extensive research and made informed decisions yes 100 % i hope we see that someday unfortunately that ’s just not a realistic expectation at this point in time people are lazy they read headlines watch the news and maybe occasionally click on an article what a majority of people do n’t do especially in the context of this debate is go searching after a bad debate performance for how it ’s actually not a bad thing if the strategy that you ’re banking on is for people to just look deeper than what they see right in front of them then it ’s a losing one
he ’s highly unlikely to win on november 5th and when he loses we lose our democracy good to know you like the job he ’s doing now though i do too but i like democracy more knock off the mental gymnastics and run another candidate oh by the way biden is down in the 538 polls today why because he gave the worst debate in political history a debate that was his idea
trump is a great candidate and a terrible president biden is a terrible candidate and a great president we ’re voting on candidates in november it ’s more about vibes optics and appearances than anything else this is what the american public uses as a proxy to determine a good leader people do not have the time for nuanced politics and intellectual debates
i ’m the first guy to discredit this stupid format been saying that shit for years i get it these little 2 minute segments are too short to make a serious point for someone who wants to run the country we need long format but yeah biden fucked up that shit was uh it was well you know with all the things um we beat rough
just play we finally beat medicare on loop until the election and for the 7 people who have n't seen it yet go watch the clip if you 've only heard the quote it 's worse than you think
yes even the msnbc and cnn panels were in their own words panicking he looked like a doddering old man if you did n't see that i have no idea what debate you were watching
biden mumbled struggled to form complete sentences stuttered and misspoke numerous times he came across as old and losing his wits the overwhelming majority of people who watched it felt this way if you truly did n’t notice you ’re probably as blind to his mental decline as trump supporters are to his constant lying
go hang around some dementia patients for a day and you 'd be shocked with biden 's performance i 'm being serious
do n’t forget the enthusiasm of statements like “ i ’d vote for biden even if he was secretly a dead cat in a tube sock this whole time ” that appear on every single thread about the debate i ’m so positive that the mr idontreallyfollowpolitics in pa is gon na have that same sentiment when he comes across clips of biden on his social media feed
and we all know a subreddit is a proper representation of america
buddy there 's no metaphor to use here ok let 's say it straight biden is too old no one believes he will survive 4 more years we need a new candidate he 's not a house and there 's no point in knocking on doors for him when every person who watched the debate believes he 's a walking corpse call it doomer or whatever but he 's got ta go he 's going to tank the democrats down the ticket yes the debate was that bad please believe me when i say this is worse than nixon vs kennedy and the way the country responded after that we have 4 months get someone else in right now and let 's start the process of hyping them up because there 's no way anyones going to convince anyone else that biden is still a viable candidate in the real world
lying to the american public is n’t a winning message what do you want people to say what you ’re seeing and hearing from biden is n’t reality do n’t believe your eyes and ears the one thing everybody can do is to call their democratic representative and tell them you want a new presidential candidate put the pressure on biden to step aside otherwise this will be 2016 “ it ’s her turn ” all over again
we need a better candidate
there 's no way i 'm knocking on doors for biden i 'd look like a moron
no it is n't transcripts are small part of the available information they 're not for pretending the only thing that happened is specific words were said
unfortunately the debate was about winning people 's votes not being right
it does nt matter facts do n't win elections vibes do
but why would they there was a televised debate to watch biden does n't communicate to the country and other countries and to the rest of the government in transcript if he ca n't even remotely communicate effectively then what are we doing here
i think it 's really sad that people would have to read a transcript of the president because that president 's cognitive and physical health are so bad his speech is n't intelligible i think it 's really sad that you think the people that do n't want to read the transcript are the problem i think it 's sad and pathetic and nightmarish that you 're sitting here berating people when a man with fucking dementia so bad he can't be understood is president what is wrong with you why are you this fucking pathetic ugh i feel disgusting and pathetic just talking to you like some of the sad cuck energy rubbed off on me disgusting
the bar is so low it might as well not exist anymore it 's shocking how much cope is going around watch any presidential debate since 1960 and they make this seem like a sad excuse for supposedly the most powerful democracy in the world embarrassing both candidates
do you remember trump 's response to the question about his plans for making childcare more affordable it made about as much sense as what biden said about whatever it was he was trying to say in that quote i think he just started rambling about veterans as if they asked him about veterans but wtf does a veteran have to do with affordable childcare
bro the pro trump people do n't give a shit about any of that lmao when are you guys going to learn trying to shame trump supporters and republicans is not going to work trump literally is a felon and has literal audio of himself saying he 's grabbing chicks by their vaginas and dude is polling to win his second presidency biden is a shit candidate and an easy victory he should n't be in a position to run
this is such an obvious cope it makes me do that soul deep cringe to watch people have such little self respect and debase themselves so much to protect a man whose brain is failing and literally everyone else in the world can see that it 's like a humiliation kink
you are correct lemme fix that larger point stands though
i always think of david sedaris ’ essay about undecided voters “ i think of being on an airplane the flight attendant comes down the aisle with her food cart and eventually parks it beside my seat can i interest you in the chicken ’ she asks or would you prefer the platter of crap with bits of broken glass in it ’ to be undecided in this election is to pause for a moment and then ask how the chicken is cooked ”
i have n’t rewatched anything yet but i remember trump calling him on the 6 and biden saying it was an 8 but he got it down to a 6 the only reason this sticks with me is because of how fucking asinine it was to watch two old white men who want to be the leader of our country argue about fucking golf to end a presidential debate
that 's not spin from the left that 's spin from dem leadership and the media all of whom are not the left
obama ’s backing tells you that the dnc is dead set i ’m surprised that the nyt board was n’t just carrying their voice this sub however is
the problem is nobody polls better against trump no rising democrat stars that can pull in moderates and independents
please no serious person that actually cares about our democracy is entertaining the idea of doing something that would almost certainly let project 2025 win just because biden had one poor showing hid admiration achievements speak for themselves
i think the amount of people with trump amnesisa are more than the media lets on
biden was obviously sick he showed up anyway i had that sore throat infection thing a few months ago it took me 3 months to get my voice back it kept going out mid sentence biden did better than me just being able to speak for that long
if substance mattered trump would never have been president
presidential debates for better or worse are 90 % about perception and 10 % about substance
what substance all biden did was lie and attack trump with debunked claims oh and forget about what he was talking about several times
hillary clinton was polled as the winner of their debates just like trump was polled as the winner in this debate john fetterman gave a disastrous debate performance when his first words were “ good night ” instead of good evening tell me how did that work out for the both of them you can argue that debate performance in the long run does n’t matter i voted for biden in 2020 and i was concerned by his performance the other night but i ’ve come around democrats are just reactive instead of proactive but i ’ll tell you this the fact that so many calls especially from nyt came out and encouraged biden to drop out and not the goddamn convicted felon with 34 felony counts tells you all you need to know about the state of media and reactionary attitudes in this country
not from the us but i watched the whole debate biden did look old but he was coherent and answered questions trump just straight out deflect every question trump is only 3 year '' younger '' than biden if i were to chose between an old man that chooses his words carefully and an old angry man that spews lies the choice is easy i really do n't understand why the media has portrayed the debate a disaster for biden
trump looked insane and biden old
the main problem is the media and spooked liberals having a nuclear meltdown it ’s not the end of the world the public ’s memory lasts until the next big story you guys are changing the public ’s perception with the reaction more than the debate ever could
you say that and yet undecideds are leaning more towards biden after the debate
what trump could n't answer a single question as it was asked he lied sharted lied some more and rambled i find this narrative that biden walked out of that debate looking bad as disingenuous at best and a full on russian and chinese propaganda propaganda at worst trump did n't even do the bare minimum required to have a serious debate ni articles talking about how he utterly failed to be present in the debate he just rambled on with bs talking points meant for faux news
yes not like the average trump supporter can read
not according to the polls the ones that are coming out that were n't kneejerk polls of 4 16 people immediately post debate are now mostly showing a biden lead 538 's even updated their predictions to show a 5 % lead for biden
simply not true everyone is tired of the convicted felon and rapist and his lies lies and more lies followed up by lies about lies that are about lying about all the lies plus add in january 6th and his bragging about roe v wade and that twice impeached bone spurs having insurrectionist does n't stand a chance other than going to jail
how did trump not look bad
president camacho agrees this is why bringing a gun and firing in the air to get attention is very presidential
same thing with songs nobody listens to the lyrics if trump and the gop wins it ’s probably the nail in the coffin for democracy in america
trump looked like he was bat shit crazy and anyone with an ounce of intelligence knew he was lying every other sentence
so optics are more than policy
all i wanted to see was biden looking good so yeah
the media was always going to claim biden did worse than trump regardless of what actually happened it ’s literally what they ’ve been doing for the past 8 years fondling trumps balls at every turn
well if the problem is bad analysis of how trump would debate then he needs to fire the people who prepped him because it was quite obvious trump would be up to his usual gish gallop
how many beers in are you by 9 30 just kidding i ’m also no spring chicken and i get suddenly exhausted around 10 pm each night my older mother on other hand takes some time release adhd meds and she ’s full of energy and could talk all night at 10 i ’m guessing that ’s what trump was on
i do n't want you to be president either then
and yet he is supposed to be president clearly his is unfit
some bands are just better in the studio
look if trump wins i 'm considering moving so do n't take this the wrong way but did you see the same debate i did its more like when biden could string a sentence together coherently and clearly it was true do not pretend like he did n't claim he defeated medicaid that was an inexcusable outing
in my mind i see it like how job interviews are bad at telling if an employee is actually good at a job in the same vein debates are nt great indicators if someone would be good at running the country now biden for some reason did himself zero favors with that performance in reassuring americans he is up for the job as president for another 4 years but i m not sure a debate is even the best way to measure that in the first place not fully defending biden i 'd rather have someone younger and i would be fully on board with someone else taking it from here
the debates are clearly performative but it seems like a lot of undecideds are leaning more towards biden after the debate
exactly if the ex obama staffers say joe should step aside for the good of the country it ’s not some vast anti biden conspiracy these guys are democrats the only foreign psyop posts i see lately are trying to get joe to stay in
came here to say this total shitshow dems are caught with their pants down imo dems should be ashamed for continuing to put him forth in his state and he should have thought of what 's best for his own party and bowed out they would n't be scrambling now sidenote two party system sucks and is totally broken
for real i could drop the hardest truthbombs in human history if i look like i just had a stroke while doing so no one 's gon na think that i 'm fit for one of the most important jobs on the planet
some people are so focused on the things he tried to say and not how horribly he communicated those things and looked in general like if you know enough about dem messaging to know what answers he meant about medicare about taxes etc etc it would sound great but most people heard him accidently say he defeated medicare and trillionaires are n't paying enough and that s when he was n't just standing there with his mouth agape looking at the ground
we ’re deep into maga conspiracy nonsense at this point this is ridiculous spin
and a lot of it was n't what he said it was his facial expression when he was n't speaking
most of what he said was n't even transcribable
this copium response is the worst kind of gaslighting no it really was that bad no circling the wagons is not the right play here we need to acknowledge the problem so we can fix it not bury our heads in the sand this election is fucking done unless something changes
i 'm not from the us and watched the debate i think biden did well he responded to questions trump just lied with confidence i think biden is just held to higher standards than trump
it was just so painful to watch because trumps so unreptantly and obviously full of shit a jr high debate student could have wiped the floor with him yet we watched biden kinda stumble and ramble around that s what made it painful for me trump was such an easy opponent
i wholeheartedly agree for someone with a stutter the trip ups were minor
that 's not even what ruined it for me he finished his sentence by saying he defeated medicaid
there ’s a lot of gaslighting and copium going on especially on reddit go over to whitepeopletwitter and you ’ll see a lot of hand waving away the debate chronically online people trying to convince other chronically online people that the average voter thinks just like them this is going to bite people in the ass hard when there ’s a repeat of 2016
yeah fuck this shit this is fox news type of propaganda spin and it ’s unacceptable i refuse to be fucking gaslit on this
to be clear the centrists thought he would wipe the floor to the left this was a very predictable exchange
thank you for saying this people are obviously in denial and need to snap out of it quick or we 're going to sleepwalk straight into another trump presidency
exactly this it happened with every major trump flub or scandal i 'm not falling for 10 000 bot accounts pretending it was n't that bad i know what i saw
biden got better as the debate went on he was definitely at his worst at the start and did improve a bit still an absolute disaster for him though in terms of the content yes some of the points he got across were valid but he was still stumbling over getting them out supposedly he had a cold that could have been it i mean i 'm nowhere near his age but i 've had moments when i 'm sick i would n't be able to stand up there and be coherent while trump repeatedly lied and did n't answer the questions he did come across a lot mentally sharper and just plain awake and aware of his surroundings polling suggests it has n't hurt biden too badly presumably people who were going to vote for him still will and even if the guy is dropping off he 's got a team around him i 'd trust more than trump but honestly any non copium interpretation of this debate it was absolutely terrible for biden i 've never seen him that bad
lmao yeah the republicans were definitely behind nyt newsweek msnbc etc all calling for biden to drop out
while that may be true i watched i ’ve always voted blue no matter who that debate ruined my night did n’t even watch the whole thing it looked like biden was about to be admitted to a home he could n’t talk trump even made fun of him i cringed when he was like i do n’t even think joe knew what he said right there literally ruined my night as it only takes a small percentage of votes that looked fucking horrible transcript aside it really did
i would n't go so far as to say it was a conspiracy i can say confidently that his live performance was very hard to watch and the criticisms from all sides were justified it 's very interesting how the combination of his speech impediment at times with regular pauses really works against him goes to show what we value as a species if we cared to actually listen he was mostly fair tho a few times i was legitimately confused what he was saying medicaid quote for example trump was highly energetic but my god it was like watching a declog on a sewer main in real time just a tidal wave of shit i could n't even track all the nonsense coming out but he had energy connected sentences stronger speech patterns sadly humans are very bad at real time discernment if someone is saying something confidently does n't slow down and goes from thing to thing we ca n't fucking stop them even if every other word is wrong we ca n't correct them it 's not natural for us i just hope our proclivities as a highly socialized species do n't end us one day
mmm now let 's add a spicy comment that will not get the attention it deserves there is russian money flooding into a number of major media organizations as we speak through less than reputable channels time the new york times cnn and various others all have compromised actors on staff can i prove it no am i confident given the timing beyond a shadow of a doubt the bot activation was perfectly timed the articles seem almost prewritten the goal is to shake voter confidence in biden and so far it appears to be working splendidly russia is winning in real time
the cnn coverage post debate was pretty telling somehow it was all about biden doing poorly even trump ’s lying was somehow biden ’s fault
i think he at least got that thru clearly he wants the same standard as roe vs wade though he was less clear when he tried to spell out what that meant do it relies on people to remember exactly what was the standard
all he has to say is i support a women 's right to choose that 's it it 's the number one argument of abortion rights he never even said that simple line
i may not vote for biden are you kidding me i 'd vote for biden 's last bowel movement over trump at least it would n't be as big a piece of shit
the problem is what the debate revealed about the two men trump was revealed to be a dangerous lunatic which we already knew biden was revealed to be incoherent and struggling to stay on topic which shocked many of us it 's precisely because the republicans would nominate someone as horrible as trump that we need a candidate who can win maybe that 's biden but after last night i 'm having a hard time seeing it
538 does n't do polling they 're an aggregator and the polls released since the debate likely would have been actually conducted before the debate biden may be down in the latest batch but it has nothing to do with the debate the debate performance should be reflected in polls coming out next week source listened to a 538 podcast where they discussed polling timelines
yes i had pre debate acknowledged i 'd be voting for biden but now i find it urgent that they run another candidate when the debate goes this poorly the performance and the fallout is going to cause substantial damage i do n't think he will beat trump handedly now which is horrifying
the format makes no sense if the guy who did n't actually even attempt to debate comes out on top it 's a fucking pageant at best
yea lets do a 12 hour format where they sit down have 5 mins to form an answer and 10 mins to speak with advisors on stage ready to stand in and speak on their behalf like give us an actual fucking briefing please with moderation i wanna see how these teams will handle big problems and i 'm sure we 'd all be surprised to see just how closely we align on a lot of things when the actual people who get things done chime in fuck even remove the speaking portion and allow them to give written responses that can allow for rebuttal like i do n't care if someone is a good speaker i want the brain
do n't forget when he turned the abortion question into something about an illegal immigrant hurting a young woman no that 's not hyperbolic it 's literally what he did and it 's worse than you think as well
one side has facts and the other is nothng but lies there 's no question about it
americans wo n't even watch movies with subtitles and this guy is like no do n't watch the video of someone speaking the same native language as you you need to read this transcript because due to the extremely obvious cognitive issues you can see he has in the video his speech is often completely unintelligible and thinks that 's a totally 100 % normal thing the dems are so fucking cooked with him as the nominee
does it say somewhere in the transcript that biden constantly looked like it would be elder abuse to give him the job because that seems like the most salient takeaway of that night
just remember when we ’re living in a full on autocracy that it ’s 100 % the dnc ’s fault we could have had a primary they could still change course now and they wo n’t
the nyt has n't carried thier voice in a while and probably still salty biden did an interview on howard stern instead of with them a month ago
no doubt but idiots feel the need to make electing head of state nothing more than a sporting event
it ’s quite clear it ’s not just for debates since we got a goddam game show host from 2016 2020
i think if you really want to evaluate the root cause it ’s because if there ’s one thing conservatives in general are good at it is rallying behind their guy look up ronald reagan and the 11th commandment american liberals on the other hand are self critical often to a fault and that extends to vocal opinions about joe biden it ’s very effective self sabotage in a political system dominated by two parties do i think there are many valid reasons to criticize joe biden absolutely sure but he ’s the guy and anything that is n’t 100 % support improves the odds of a convicted felon and rapist being president again and that seems to be lost on many
we were all hoping for state of the union biden was n't his best moment but i 'm expecting the rapid news cycle to move on from this pretty quickly
it 's not just the media it 's his followers every single person is aware that the presentation mattered more than substance tonight the undecided apathetic are absolute fools they are going to be swayed on criteria that only fools care about biden needed to look and sound like the absolute best version of himself that we 've ever seen to sway those people he did not
the media has a vested interest in keeping political conflict alive if the media did what it 's supposed to do trump would n't have even made it to the white house the first time but trump brings in ratings and ratings make money before the debate trump was lagging the media had to do something to keep the money flowing if politics became boring again they 'd lose their cash cow so they 're giving him a boost on the other side of the coin biden is boring professional courteous decent knowledgeable and boring a president needs to be boring we should n't be on the edge of our seats wondering if the president is going to go off the rails shit in his hand and throw it at his political opponent but again the media wants money and boring presidents do n't make money so the media as a whole is going to do everything in their power to belittle biden and boost trump they love money they want money they 're willing to throw democracy in the dumpster so they can make a buck
because so many media members are buddies with politicians who all want their chance to claw biden out of the way and make a name for themselves on the national stage the media personalities are living in their stupid little dc bubble they ’re all force feeding each other the same catastrophic shit over and over again am i thrilled with everything biden does no but with the world in the brink of climate and war catastrophe i ’m super reassured by him and his experience trump crapped lies all over the stage and i ’m supposed to call him the winner because biden had a scratchy voice
the media makes more money when trump is a headliner
coherent lmao i think you were watching a debate from 2020
while mostly coherent the early incoherent quote leading up to “ we beat medicare ” will be played on loop
i love biden but he did terrible he needed to be able to call out trump of some of the obvious made up lies he was telling right there on the spot and counter him biden also was not good at all in defending abortion which should have been something so prepared for that he should have had no problems it just looked bad there 's no way i would vote for trump and i know he lied but it was a bad showing i wanted to see trump called out on his lies
it ’s absolutely crazy to act like this was n’t a disaster for biden his answers were mumbled and incoherent he lost his train of thought mid sentence multiple times he started an answer on abortion his strongest point and redirected it to immigration his weakest look i ’d vote for a dirty trash can over donald trump and i ’m sure biden still has a pretty decent chance but last night joe biden just showed the world that all of the concern over his age is completely valid donald trump is only 3 years younger than him and on stage next to him he looked decades younger
they saw the first 20 minutes and thought that ’s how it was the whole debate because first impressions are what ultimately count to many and are not patient enough to see the whole thing imho trump was trump in the second half which obviously did n’t help him seal the deal and biden stopped mumbling as much or stuttering in pain meanwhile but the damage was done earlier in their eyes
why the media has portrayed the debate a disaster for biden almost all of our usa media is owned by a nazi sympathizer
the choice is easy yup and half our stupid country has been lobotomized
what about when biden got lost during questions and had to be stopped by moderators also looking absolutely clueless on camera did n’t help biden
well the debate was kind of a disaster but biden performed well at his rally in nc the next day
the white house has tried to tell the public that biden has been energetic behind the scenes for the last few years that debate shows he 's old and feeble there is no way he is coherent enough to be president until 2028
that 's exactly what i see to as an american and it 's maddening to see so much bullshit well trumps a madman but wow the insanity gives him such energy one of these men has already proved to be unable to be trusted around highly sensitive and secret documents that alone should decide this election and i feel very little hope for this country that it seemingly has n't it 's a scary time
he was not coherent for a good 30 minutes i had to leave the house
completely agreed i just do n't see what is going on here was biden a powerhouse at the debate no but he sure as hell was n't as bad as what people are making it sound i think this is very clearly people sowing the seeds of doubt on biden to make him appear weak and boost trump 's support and so many people are falling for it hook line and sinker as an outsider looking in this has been painful to watch
because republican operatives have been painting him as an old dude with failing mental capacities so people are being conditioned to think that is possible for any moment of weakness they also were prepared to say biden was on drugs if he came out strong either way they get to control the narrative
trump is insane and they both are too old
sorry we were n’t briefed ahead of time to our marching orders “ if biden appears alarmingly incoherent pretend nothings wrong and do n’t comment or talk about it ”
that was a small group of latino voters who watched the debate and then talked to a newsweek reporter not even a poll but what matters is not undecided or swing voters nationwide but turnout in the six swing states arizona georgia michigan nevada pennsylvania and wisconsin look at biden ’s figures in those states in five of them he is lower than the d senator up for re election he is a drag on d turnout where it matters
given their penchant for revisionist history i really do question if they can read without demagogue blinders
if only unless trump is in jail on election day he will get 70 million votes hopefully biden will get many more but trump is going to pull a lot of votes
the number of people on here claiming confidently that trump would be too scared to even show up to the debate hopefully biden 's team is n't full of redditors
i would n't want me to be president either i 'd have a stroke from all the stress least biden is n't trump i 'd vote for a fucking racoon over trump i still believe in good christian morals of which trump has none
true but also in the case of presidential jobs go these debates do nothing to actually demonstrate ability to do the actual job there really is n’t any version of a live concert to see how these guys do vs a studio they are going to always be in the studio and we know that trump is a terrible studio band already and biden has been a pretty good studio band so far
if by a lot ’ you mean five sure
same i am shocked at this spin we expect it from rs but we need to show we can do better
people vote based on vibes and rhetoric he could n't deliver his rhetoric and had the vibes of a corpse
the i ca n't believe i 'm running against this orange buffoon spewing bullshit face
but that ’s the thing it looks bad at first glance but he was clearly listening the fact people get hung up on a fucking face is sad as hell i do n’t think he did great but rewatching it he really did n’t do horrifically bad in content just a terrible delivery of decent messages points
breaking casual viewers saw that how dumb do we think people are i asked a few of my totally nonpolitical friends to watch the debate after grumbling a few actually did so every one of them said biden looked bad but answered questions and trump was full of shit and avoided questions the debate did not help donald trump and did not hurt joe biden what hurts joe biden is focusing on this ridiculous idea of replacing him against the wishes of the primary voters rather than focusing on joe biden 's accomplishments and the dangers of donald trump and the republican supreme court republicans are very happy right now
indeed the vast conspiracy even reached the old obama comms guys who are friends with biden at crooked media seriously people smoking some major copium biden was that bad he does need to step aside for someone younger and the real boy actions i ’ve been seeing lately are all trying to get him to stay in the race now same low effort posts that were saying “ genocide joe ” a week ago are saying “ we love our president we still support you ”
trump just vomited lie after lie he ’s lower than the belly of a snake disgusting
i also think the way biden was speaking would 've been less criticised if they did n't keep the close up shots on both of them at all times it was the way he looked while trump was speaking mixed with his speech impediment that got people concerned
it was very hard to watch donald trump lying at lightning speed over the soft spoken joe biden who mentioned many very specific facts about policies albiet with a few moments of distraction by donald 's incessant lies but donald trump received few criticisms from all sides
wait til you hear that journalists write articles about things as they 're happening
same shit on twitter x but wanna hear the crazy part i do n’t have many followers or friends never do i get likes but when i posted about an issue with a video game that same day i all of a sudden got a bunch of likes and shares of that post and every single one of them shared far right posts wtf
dude reddit comments went down near on globally after the debate too many bits xd
it was clear to me that biden spent too much time preparing and not enough time resting his voice was shot because he spent too much time talking but by the time the debate here his adrenaline wore off and he was shot debates are stupid now because the way the news covers them like a performance and not the actual things the candidates said there is almost no substance policy in what they cover spin it after it is over it ’s covered specifically to be click bait because trump was more measured in his dumb fascist lunacy he somehow won everyone can see he is a raving lunatic that would push his own mother in front of a bus to get elected
no the debate performance is reflected in the polls coming out now “ is biden capable of doing the job yes 33 % no 66 % is trump 50 50 ” seriously that ’s the game unless the candidate changes
damn then next week will be a blood bath
and that 's just it donald trump should be beaten handedly i think that we have this assumption that the american people are extremely apathetic they are and that apathy is what 's causing so many non republicans to support trump i do n't believe it is the problem is biden has low approval ratings and voters do not feel like they have good options they do n't view trump as somebody who could wreck democracy it 's the job of a democratic candidate to inform the public about how much of a threat trump is to remind the public about trump 's poor covid performance to remind the public that trump is responsible for bans on abortion etc etc etc and that is not something biden did during debate and that is something he 's failing to do in general
i would say the ommission of the truth is not far from the lie and using these edited transcripts to assess debate performance is omitting a lot of the truth
your response to my specific question made almost exactly as much sense as trump 's response to the question of affordable childcare bravo sir
why do so many people insist on acting like thr dnc is this all power nebulous thing that has direct control over everyone should biden have committed to only serving one term yes is it the dncs fault thr media landscape is horrible the republicans are horrible and half the american population has the intelligence of a brick biden is the incumbent president and frankly he 's done a very good job as president also people like newsom said they were n't running so the alternatives were few and themselves nothing inspiring i can see why the dnc were fine continuing with biden
that 's such silly baby logic so in this magical world of yours when is the right responsible for their own actions biden is old and a lot of things but trump has always been a vindictive lying con artist and he tasted real power and needs to avoid even the slightest punishment for his actions did bidrn raise trump this way did obama force him at gun point to ignore covid while he lined his pockets dems can have bad candidates without justifying a neo fascist muppet baby
maybe give some credit to the party actually running as autocratic maniacs
it ’s unheard of to primary a sitting president we had a primary it happened in 2020 most states did vote despite the pandemic biden was the result he had two strong challengers and while lots of polls suggest voters prefer “ generic democrat ” in this election over biden those leads disappear the moment you name a name any name so yeah it ’s a bunch of idiots saying “ anyone else but no not him not him either ” the single biggest advantage a candidate can have is being the incumbent if biden can win as the incumbent whatever alternative democrat you name had no chance
just read the transcript in the most charitable way possible in his rally voice and imagining he did n’t have an alzheimer ’s episode look on his face and you ’ll see he won if you do n’t you ’re a meany and a doo doo head and it will be your fault that he loses in november
it 's because dems want their president to be as good as possible and the cult wants exactly the opposite
this is n’t about liberals or conservatives those votes are set
in total i think he did fine the fact that he sumbled a couple of times while discussing actual policies while trump was going out of his way to not answer question and just lied should be a point towards biden for women voters the way trump responded to the abortion question should give pause '' everyone was happy that we killed it it should be up to the states and democrats are killing babies '' i 'm from a former communist country that banned abortion the first thing that was done was to repeal that decree it should not be up to the state it should be a discussion between a woman and a doctor
the double standard is downright insulting
biden was n’t at his best well i guess we ’ll vote for a the fascist convicted felon who attempted a coup s
but he was on point on discussing policies trump lust lied and lied not from the us but voting for trump is basically a nail in the coffin no one takes him seriosly and he is in love with putin
he answered the question and was clear on policies trump just lied and deflected all the questions
i personally was more of the camp of i will believe it when i see he actually shows up for the debate so personally was on the fence about him even showing with that said again there is only one tactic trump has and that 's gish gallop
give me well meaning corpse vibes from someone who 's been fighting to make our country better since before i was even born over a blatant and proven liar rapist convicted felon and traitor
i had that same dumb stuck mouth agape face listening to trump sure it was funny looking but was anyone listening to the shit spewing from the other guy at the time
yep and no one is talking about it no one
usually that ’s true like every single other time usually it is actual politicians talking about vague platform points and mudslinging to obfuscate how much they ’ve avoided doing what they were elected to do when it should be about how well the issues have been presented and dealt with but this one really was a pageant because trump does n’t care about typical political barb exchanging he ’ll just stand behind you and act weird and say you should be in prison and they ’ll say he won and biden is currently having to constantly battle down every attack on his age and appearance so the only job he had was to not look as old as he is instead biden looked older than he is so old that donald being stuck behind the podium with a microphone he is n’t in control of almost looked better to the audience than his usual shtick the optics matter here because they mattered going in we should not have to be collectively responsible for diagnosing a man from our armchairs but his public appearances have been shaky enough prior to the debate that we were already asking the question his answer was not reassuring
could n’t agree more i have seen some of the smartest people i know over prepare for a pitch and when it comes time to it just blow it as they try and say everything that ’s in their head i ’m not saying that this was n’t a moment where we needed the president to crush it because it was and that was a huge fail however this is also a completely unrealistic test because do you know how many people are there to prep and prepare information for a president each day there is n’t a world leader ceo etc that does n’t work off notes or support structure from the people around him your ability to discern what ’s important is key and yes before you say it communicate it in a clear manner which president biden failed to do here this was a fail but how he recovers from this fail is equally as important
it does n't matter who won biden came across as an incapable old man and it breaks my heart this was the one time he needed to show the country that he was still in good shape still mentally fit to be president and he sounded like he was n't quite sure what was going on trump was exactly the dumb fascist we expected but he seemed like he was in control of his dumb fascist statements pivoting at every point to what he wanted to talk about biden kept wandering off course pivoting away from his strengths bringing up trump 's talking points unprompted i fear what this means for our country
when trump said i do n't know what he was talking about at the end there i do n't think he knew what he was talking about i knew it was over literally almost any democratic candidate could have handled the debate better also the democratic party and the older crowds hillary loved to say get over yourselves you have to vote biden so why are they so unwilling to let biden go and run someone else even after the disaster we saw the other night why ca n't they suck it up and vote blue no matter who it 's really scary to me thinking about biden vs trump
i 'm starting to feel like maybe lots of stuff does n't make sense to you
it ’s also because party loyalty is n’t instilled by the democratic party as a core party value there is no team first mentality for better and for worse i think in general it ought to be that way but i ’m not sure it ’s viable in the present day field of american politics
the last line should be the official rallying cry of the dems say this enough times and you will peel off a good number of republican women
who just stood up there spouting lies
yes that ’s how swing voters will vote what will you do about that
i would vote for biden ’s corpse to keep trump out of office
you and i are not the voter biden had to convince to vote for him at the debate
the user of r politics are not the people who need convincing
imagine how you are going to feel when biden 's stubbornness results in a 2nd trump term and 1 3 more supreme court picks he could cement the conservative majority for a generation
no one who is criticizing biden ’s performance in this sub is going to vote for someone else or abstain we are rightfully concerned about the low information swing voters who will decide this election ie the stupid people of which it only was a margin of 40 000 votes last time
bc i have eyes saw the debate
yep i do n't know what he was talking about i do n't think he knew what he was talking about that was the take away statement from this debate i think biden did a great job as president i think he 'd continue to do so if he was re elected but that debate was the end of a political career i agree with everything you 're saying what 's upsetting is there are potential candidates who poll higher than trump now before they are even candidates just press the staples easy button tm and choose another candidate trump is actually an extremely vulnerable and poor presidential candidate he just needs an opponent who can expose that
that 's because to them it has never been vote blue no matter who that is what they say to get us to fall into line it 's really vote for who we tell you to vote for or you somehow hate democracy
i have to find another source for how things are actually going than this place it is so strange here
i hope it happens man i really do all of these supreme court rulings are bumming me out a lot
when abortion was the topic and biden accidentally started talking about illegal immigration i could not believe it yes please steer away from the question that best supports your candidacy and instead talk about the one that least supports it great idea
this is bumming me out all over again i watched with my parents 60 and fully expected them to be like ehhh quit whining biden is our guy but they were just as flabbergasted as me sirens are going off will the democratic party put out the fire or just turn off the alarm and hope this place does n't burn down
my takeaway is that cnn wants to be in the entertainment business and not news they want a piece of fox 's business it creates a naked credibility problem for all their reporting where before they had some benefit of doubt
the fact that trump just kept spewing lies unimpeded and was never fact checked on his fucking nonsense tells you everything you need to know about what cnn 's journalistic values are
all in a desperate attempt to appear impartial which had zero impact because all the anti cnn people called them biased after the debate anyway even though they asked super tame questions and never corrected anyone they were also saying biden has an earpiece when he clearly did n’t i get they are stuck in a hard spot but there was definitely more room to push back there
i think it ’s beyond time to actively boycott cnn
cnn sucks i have n't referred to them as a news source for decades
pretty much all debates are useless regardless of the news network or hosts nothing useful comes from them except controversy for media exploitation the most recent one appears to be different in terms of candidate condition though it will be interesting to find out what really happened before the debate because something did happen
that makes sense cnn has been presenting fact free news for years
if only there was a representative from the opposing party present who could accurately and concisely correct the lies there should really be two sides present in a national contest like this
turns out the best defense against fact checking is just to lie about everything
they have a pretty strong right wing faction in their ownership
what the electoral college has done to this country is a disgrace it ’s absolutely unacceptable we should all be ashamed of ourselves the electoral college lost the first debate it ’s a failed idea
the problem is n't just cnn it 's the rest of the nation nbsp they 're showing us a debate as a contest of projecting strength rather than a contest of ideas because we 're a largely ignorant society that prioritizes the strongman over democracy this sort of bullshit has toppled other nations in history and it might actually be our turn to fall destroyed from within by the extremists edit that would be the fascist republican party at present who want absolute power over the rest of us
i heard daniel dale was going to be fact checking i guess this was in some venue i did n't pick up on
does anyone think the late tim russert would have let trump run all over him and bamboozle the viewing audience
this was n't a fact free debate one candidate did not have any facts
the biden campaign agreed to this his campaign insisted on a lot of rules like no audience mic being muted etc which they got sorry do n’t blame cnn for the total biden meltdown
is it too much to ask that i ’d like a president who is perfectly capable of fighting his own fights and calling out his opponents lies in a debate you know without needing help from the moderators am i alone here
idk i think it ’s up to your opponent to fact check cnn giving the illusion even if somewhat justifiable that their partisan would have only added to the narrative that biden is weak and feeble we ’re not thinking about the voters we actually need to win
it ’s not the moderators ’ job to fact check biden should have fact checked trump a debate is between two people and there was someone on stage who could have fact checked trump but he failed to do so
it ’s so ridiculous to blame the network the moderators the media the voters “ why are you saying biden is old trump lied ” here ’s a fact any dem who can put together a sentence away from a teleprompter would ’ve squashed trump it ’s the democratic party ’s fault period
joe biden had every chance to challenge trump on facts yet he does n’t have the mental capacity too cnn conducted fact checks and represented them shortly after the debate to insert consistent fact checks which are largely subjective would ruin the debate
the moderators were impartial and fair they asked questions and monitored time it ’s not the job of the moderators to fact check that ’s what the other people on the debate stage are supposed to do you do n’t want biased moderators to try and mask a candidate ’s knowledge and ability do you really want fox news to decide what a fact is
i hear complaints here about trumps lies but not biden ’s neither should be allowed to get away with it
i ’ve watched cnn for awhile and with trumps town hall and this debate it ’s clear they ’re being malicious for the sake of ratings zero backbone from dana bash and jake tapper let trump ramble on about complete bullshit and then have the audacity to host a post debate smearfest and have the likes of scott jennings spouting more bullshit being unchecked just so they can have a “ both sides ” perspective literally selling out our democracy for ratings
i honestly do n't think they would have had the time to fact check trump the entire time just let them spill the beans and then it would give them coverage to work on explaining to viewers what were lies and what was truth the only problem is that some of the people who tuned into the debate wo n't be tuning into the reviews of the debate
this all corp media the fourth estate is for profit and bows to investors corporations and special interests fox caters to an audience msnbc to another demographic cnn since their buyout says they are both siding things but obviously want churn up controversy for ratings
truth does n’t make money people want money what did you expect
the dems put it on cnn the dems struck down live fact checking and the dems got rid of an audience not to mention joe biden could n’t but a sentence together long enough to lie but he somehow managed to still be the least trustworthy person on the stage
i only get conservative stuff in my feeds can you link me to someone fact checking his lies
i do n't think that 's true i 've seen praise from conservatives for cnn 's impartiality
i 've been on a total cnn boycott since they did the trump town hall last year i thought it was a disgraceful and shameful step towards normalizing him and it made me sick he should 've been arrested on january 7th and impeached on january 8th
i was just out of college when the league of women voters resigned from sponsoring the presidential debates as i recall both sides had requested some rules they could not abide by they rejected the idea that the parties themselves could produce objective debates they were right presidential debates since then imo have been mostly useless edit curious about what you think might have happened before the debate
then there would be no debate it would be biden correcting trump the entire time biden did himself few favors but cnn showed what they are
cnn is way far left
it is up to the moderator to follow up
i agree the debate was n’t the place for them to put their thumb on the scale but both tapper and bash have given their unvarnished opinion on trump many times over the years and it is n’t positive i doubt trump would have agreed to the debate if they had not indicated they would be more impartial
you seem to be under the bizarre impression that cnn hosting a trash debate and biden giving a terrible performance are mutually exclusive they 're not
yep they ’ve underestimated the rot of the gop since the hilary disaster both parties can go to hell for hurting the country
true but as usual trump lied more than biden biden 's biggest lie was border patrol as they 're all in on fascism not with him but trump lied so much that you ca n't keep track otoh
biden had 1 lie border patrol endorsement trump had 1 truth right to try act the simple fact is how can anyone trust a leader who does nothing but lie about everything
i 'm still mad about that town hall months ago
which shows how silly they are before when they were freaking out thst the felon melon was gon na suck rigged commie news network riiiigggggeed now that the network is fine because it let their liar lie without challenge to be clear biden also dropped the ball but i do think fact checking should be a thing from the moderators both bidens no soldiers died and trumps abortion happens post birth especially should 've been called out
must be tracking on different online circles then i have n’t seen a single comment to that effect i ’m in some pretty cesspooly places though i guess
i think you may be onto something there but at least bush and clinton gave a debate some effort zingers became more important than most of the debate
it would be biden correcting trump the entire time and that 's not debating in your view biden could 've wrecked trump on multiple topics most notably abortion but he fumbled there 's no sense pretending it was somehow the moderators ' fault what does that even accomplish besides making biden partisans momentarily feel better for a reason the broader electorate could n't care less about
nonsense they 're a wannabee fox news elie and dana take whatever spin is commanded from on high and they keep hiring a trumper to balance out the conversation and that person is consistently a smoothbrain that bald guy as the latest example
used to be left leaning but not anymore
i do n’t disagree under normal circumstances but if you followed up every time trump lied it would ’ve just been a debate between trump and the moderators with biden giving that god awful stare it ’s part of the beast that is trump biden should ’ve instead just laid out his vision to the undecided or threw some actual policy punches but he unfortunately lacks the capacity too
you ’re not getting it it ’s not about what we want or trump wants or biden wants it ’s about winning it ’s about changing the narrative that biden is weak and feeble would the left have loved it absolutely but that would ’ve not played well at all with the undecided who were already seeing their concerns manifest before their very eyes
you all are only saying it ’s a trash debate because biden was horrible if a person who can speak without a teleprompter was on that stage none of you would be saying it ’s the network ’s fault
trump gish galloped he at no point actually said anything to answer a single question
yeah it 's really just devolved to a bit of a circus at this point
you ’re not getting it it ’s not about what we want or trump wants or biden wants it ’s about winning this statement does n’t make a lot of sense by winning i assume you mean biden or another d winning the election so that is about what we want
being horrible but factual should n’t be seen as a loss when the other guy just spewed lies and would n’t actually answer the questions being asked though the mods just stood there and accepted the most random answers to fairly straight forward questions and yet somehow that guy is being held as a “ winner ”
luckily biden let everyone know that he beat medicare
trump was awful lying and off topic any person who can put together a sentence would ’ve crushed him it ’s not the network ’s job to debate on behalf of biden
some republican lawmakers including florida governor ron desantis say that the now public consumption of marijuana is a nuisance to people who do n’t like the smell and a quality of life issue for fucks sake republicans love grasping at fucking straws
i do n't like the smell of bullshit so we should ban the gop as well quality of life and all that
while the smoke their cigars i would take cannibis over cigars and cigarettes any day
have they even smelled their presidential candidate
i do n’t like smelling bad breath body odor or cigarette smoke either republicans usually have all three but here we are
i do n’t like the way republicans smell but i have to put up with it
everything republicans say is nonsense ca n’t be reasoned with
meanwhile magats cool with smelling like a 3 4 empty can of keystone turned dip cup being used as an ashtray with a dash of anime convention level bo
cool so we ’re banning nicotine products and combustion engines i hate the smell of natural gas adulterants let ’s talk about stoves
hahaha i love how they ’re offended by this but take campaign donations from big tobacco and say “ snowflake ” as they blow their cigar plume at people
no problem going maskless and exposing people to a deadly virus via exhalation but exposing people to a smell they might find unpleasant via exhalation is a bridge too far
i ’m all for legalization but would support a ban on smoking vaping anything in public
oh so it ’s an environmental reason interesting they have n’t given a shit about the environment until now fuck these fucking motherfuckers
so funny i ’m old enough to remember cigarette smoking on airplanes restaurants and dr waiting rooms
i oppose diesel for the same reason
how can people who swim in bullshit have a problem with the smell of weed how can they even smell weed
i smoke cigars and smell is absolutely a reason to limit the use of something i make sure i smoke where it does n't bother anyone i 'm fine with not smoking in public parks that 's not to say republicans are n't being unreasonable here there 's no reason you ca n't just limit weed to places where cigars and cigarettes are limited to but all the maladjusted redditors commenting that smell does n't matter here are ignorant it 's important to have places where you can just get a breath of fresh air you 're just not going to get an appreciation for that from people who have n't gone outside to touch grass in a year
i ’m all for legalization but when i ’m in my sealed car using air conditioning and other cars ’ weed smell comes through that s damn annoying
i do n’t like the way old people smell but i do n’t call to fucking outlaw them
i mean fair enough you ca n't ban tobacco because of the smoke smell but allow cannabis
“ what about beer breath ” “ no comment ”
and kansas smells like cow shit but you know what they say smells like money to me
let 's continue to lock people up cause we do n't like the smell of what they smoke btw did you see my huge truck that exhausts huge clouds of black smoke especially when i rev it when i 'm at a stop light oh you do n't like when i do that fuck your feelings this is my freedom republicans in a nutshell
time for ol’ buttfucker tim to be a killjoy but before i do a disclaimer i do n’t have anything against people using the weed while i do n’t partake anymore ol’ tim has a storied history of jazz cigarette use that aside weed fucking stinks like enough that i do consider weed smoke a legitimate nuisance in some circumstances i ’m not saying that mj users are n’t for the most part reasonable respectful responsible people but my experience is that there are more than enough inconsiderate or willfully obtuse users out there because of that i do think government has legitimate business restricting and regulating use what do i mean as someone who has lived in small apartment complexes coming home most nights to your whole building including your own apartment reeking like skunk ass sucks it sucks even more feeling like you need to move because diplomacy has failed and your landlord does n’t have the appetite to do anything about it it also sucks to be at the park with your family and some skeezy dick decides that nearby and now is the time and place to get high despite local laws saying it is a no no could you call the police sure they ’ll get right on that in 4 hours after the person is long gone
tell the gop that since scotus killed the epa 's good neighbor pollution rules they should stop being snowflakes
i think ron desantis is a rotten human being i think they ’re looking for any way to maintain the drug as illegal for a prison pipeline i happily voted for candidates who supported the legalization in illinois and was glad it made it through that said i ca n’t drive by a neighborhood without smelling it i commonly will drive by cars that reek of it because people will smoke up and pick up keys call me sensitive but i do n’t want to experience that skunky smell all over my town and i do n’t want people thinking they can hot box their car and put others in danger legalization creates a permission structure and people have n’t caught on yet the actual dangers of it because so many people hammer home the “ it ’s just a plant it does n’t have effects on your help in fact it ’s good for you ” messaging i had hoped more people would have converted to edibles and vape pens but i guess there ’s plenty of hunger for flower and i ’m stuck putting up with it
so legalize gummies they 're gon na be real mad when they find out how bad cigarettes stink
i heard that jt actually cleans the air around republicans because it makes them go away
after living in la for 4 years i have to admit the smell is horrible and while i agree to legalization i do think there needs to be a strict enforcement to the smell it just plain sucked in la and somewhere in florida where its muggy the smell lingers and becomes stale and nasty florida has many plants and animal poop that lingers around
it 's better than the smell of hookers big macs and alcohol coming from them
i ’m not crazy about the smell but cigarettes and most cigars are worse
i do n’t like the smell of cigarettes and those are still legal
great idea we should ban all gas guzzling cars on account of the smell rolling coal and gas stations stink we should ban ointments and oils they give me a migraine no more lotions we should ban perfume and hairspray my nostrils are not your pheromone playground we should ban dogs and cats and birds they all have a smell and we can smell it on you burn pits have to go i can smell them for miles and miles factory exhausts are all smell we should ban factories pollutants smell we should probably ban those things fracking is making the tap water smell we should get rid of that as well manure from landscaped golf courses absolutely stinks around here right now it should be illegal to mulch golf courses which are just focus pits of odor
sorry but this is one area where they are right i do n't give two shits what you do at your home but i 'm honestly pretty sick of parks parking lots beaches shopping centers and literally every other place smelling like weed it is a nuisance it is far more potent a smell than cigarettes which i also ca n't stand and would be happy to see outlawed in public as well and it stays around longer
seriously that shit stinks i agree with the no 's on this
a valid excuse i d say if you wanna smoke weed do it in your basement not in my face
you can legalise cannabis without legalising smoking it cannabis is legal in the uk with a prescription but smoking it is still illegal it has to be eaten or vaped for health reasons but it also means there is less smell
what about the smell of their huge ass trucks
meanwhile non cigarette smokers love that smell
just make up anything by blowing smoke to raise money for your new pac group to fight amendment 3 it 's the end of the world if desantis does not get his way sound familiar
but they need a cigar room
can we do the same for cigarettes then or the factory polluting the air
weed the old the fat all highly illegal
let ’s get rid of alcohol then hate that boozed up smell
this weed smell is interfering with my rolling coal enjoyment
do n't like it then maybe do n't stick your nose so high
i ’ll concede as a weed user that it is indeed very smelly it does not follow that smelling bad is a reason to outlaw something
bad smells should be illegal they going to start worrying about miasma next
to be fair abs i am very thc friendly new york city and queens reek of pot every where you go lol it ’s good it ’s legal but i get how people who do n’t like it maybe do n’t want the entire city to reek
gop to ban skunks and body oder next
yea ban axe body spray first and i might think you 're not a bunch of liars
so are we making cigarettes and cigars illegal i do n’t understand
if they care so much about smells then why not make cigarettes illegal
and yet cigars are legal
i fkr one like the smell it smells loke a good time about to happen
i fucking hate republicans conservatives but have to admit you ca n’t go 1 2 a block here ontario canada without being accosted by the strong smell of skunk weed and the poor people who live near the greenhouses you drive past one at 120 km h on the highway with your windows closed and ac on and can still barely breathe the stench is so bad weed growers should work on making the weed less smelly not stronger which is what they actually seem to be doing weed did n’t smell this strong 20 30 years ago
that 's not even the weirdest one i have heard in mn the gop argued about all the poor out of work drug dogs and what would happen to them dems jokingly put in an amendment that each of them would adopt one of those dogs but obviously withdrew it before they voted
yet they gutted regulatory agencies seems like the dea is useless now
yeah i hear this argument all the time and i ’m just thinking you catch a wiff of pot and you lose your shit if that ’s the case why have n’t you banned cow and horse manure or that turkey farm that just reeks during the summer and through the winter there are so many smells out there that are annoying but the smell of cannabis you pick up once in a while is n’t a good enough reason to not legalize it arguing on that is what a toddler does
yet we have to smell their disgusting cigars
the kettle calling the pot black
i agree that the smell not a pot smoker anymore can get annoying but that is not a good reason at all to not legalize it get an air purifier or pass laws like we did with cigarettes and make designated spots for smoking
strangely enough smell complaints is one of my primary reasons for opposing conservatives
“ ew it smells bad ” felony possession charge
at least they are using facts the way something smells vs using complete fiction abortion after birth which does n't happen and is n't a thing to justify their position
cigs are way worse i smoked them for over a decade
one could say the same for corporate pig and chicken farm and the way they pollute downstream and make everything stink for miles they are perfectly good with
i complain about the smell when it 's seeping into my apartment from an adjacent apartment simply because i work for the feds and it would not be good if that scent followed me around however if it were legalized i would not care one bit it 's no different than the smell of cigarettes as far as how much people dislike it and no one is being detained for the pack of kools rolled up in their sleeve
fucking snowflakes pretty rich coming from the same crowd that has no problem with noxious diesel fumes coming from their oversized douchewagons
i mean if we 're now making things illegal because they smell bad trump has to be buried in a concrete bunker
diesel and gasoline smell too so does tobacco so does factory farming or even regular farming any of those illegal
minnesota legalized well closer to decriminalize possession a year ago and honestly i thought i would see a huge difference but not really anything different to speak of
ffs as if nicotine smells better
unless you make the same argument for criminalizing tobacco it ca n't be taken seriously
apparently so does trump and the complaints come from them as well so should we
by that logic cigarettes should n’t be legal either i ’d rather smell weed than cigarettes
what if i love the smell of the sticky icky
earlier this month mike a 52 year old maintenance worker sat on a bench at herbert von king park in brooklyn smoking a blunt “ i ’ve been doing it for so long i do n’t even smoke to get high ” said mike a brooklyn native who has smoked since he was about 11 years old and declined to give his last name potheads really are insufferable
since recreational pot was legalized in mo st louis reeks of it but it also reeks from the mississippi the ab brewery diesel exhaust the storm sewers and the horrible perfume some gal was wearing on the bar patio last night it could have gagged a maggot so what 's a little pot thrown into the mix
by that logic burger king should be illegal
this is very true republicans will use any excuse to stop marijuana legalization they do n’t want it legalized on their watch yet planning department red necks are all in for alcohol but what happens when they ban it is the chinese and mexican mafias move into fill the void thus no taxes are paid
i do n’t like dumpster smells or the trash truck that comes by on a hot day desantis will certainly have a cure for this
if you hate the smell of cannabis you ’re going to abhor the smell of cigarettes and vomit induced by alcohol poisoning
meanwhile ron sniffs trump 's diaper daily
then outlaw perfume cigarettes smelly food farting in public makes complete sense do n't it s
hey but when its toxic and noxious fumes nbd snowflake
meanwhile florida has an entire tourism industry built around producing and smoking cigars and everyone loves the smell of cigars and vape pens and edibles smell bad
real reason is cops love the smell of cannabis sniff sniff smells like i have probable cause to detain and search you does n't matter if they smell it or not but it 's such an easy thing for them to lie about to detain you
i mean i do n't like the smell of cannabis actually i freakin ' hate it but i still think it should be legal
good now do the same thing with cigarettes say what you want about weed but i 've never had a pothead patient come in reeking of baked in smoke so badly we gag and have to break out medical deodorizers to finish a fucking pcp exam heavy cigarette smokers positively reek
he is a woke straw or star started a whole new pac group just to fight amendment 3 that smell woke was the political version of a flash in the pan i got banned from the florida reddit post for not being pro growth enough for the real estate moderators update have you heard desantis use the word woke since his iowa presidential primary defeat
i do n’t like the smell of cigarettes but you do n’t see me out there trying to criminalize that toxic crap some people need to just mind their own
meanwhile they 're not going to do a damn thing about actual air quality co2 and industrial pollution
they had no issue with cigs
by that logic cigarettes should be in the same ballpark
no need to worry there are millions of high people contemplating this very issue and have been working to perfect this for years one day a random stoner will come out of their home with a scent less weed for the professional connoisseur who enjoys a good toke without the hassle of the man smelling him have faith my weed brethren all is not lost yet
you know i ’m all for the legalization of marijuana but it does stink you can smell it on people for a while too it ’s just not a subtle smell
but we can roll coal yeehaw
already legal cigarettes make a much worse smell goodness gracious
i ’d rather smell weed smoke than any form of tobacco smoke
what about all the assholes and creatures that come out at night drinking and being belligerent they have n’t banned alcohol for that
they just love crying about something bored with ignorance delusion and privilege so crying is the only thing that keeps em in the spotlight
then they should outlaw trash too oh wait that would n't be fair to twump voters
i mean did n't stop us from smoking cigarettes for a century any smoking smells unless it 's liquid vapor i agree that public marijuana consumption is a nuisance as much as i agree that cig smoking is a nuisance even more so if we compare blunts to cigars we should n't be smoking these things in public also alcohol consumption smell and should n't be public either basically this nuisance can be regulated it does n't prevent legalization
ban all cigars then no make them illegal
what ’s funny is they were the ones calling people snowflakes
smell of cannabis makes me dizzy i have allergy for it
i do n’t like desantis but i agree on this weed stinks and i do n’t want to smell it everywhere i go it comes off as really ghetto gummies are the way to go all of the benefits of weed without the funky smell
canadian here i have never smelled marijuana from someone else i have had to have two apartments due to cigarette smell though and my current place i frequently need to close windows because of cigarette smoke that said as a pot smoker i would trade weed for a cigarette ban if we are so worried about smells
same and their big diesel trucks “ rolling coal ”
i do n't smoke at all and would agree that cigarettes are easily the worst but i do n't mind the smell of cigars i do n't like the smell of weed either and get slightly annoyed when my neighbor smokes and i can smell it in my apartment but that 's a me and the building itself issue and febreze exists
and cars but cars are much more useful your car is useless to me as my weed is to you
how about none of the above they all reek
law suit to banning smoking based on this
rather take neither both smell terrible when it lingers around and turns stale
this is only an answer someone who smokes weed would say weed smell is way more potent and stays around waaaaaaay longer than tobacco smoke i do n’t smoke anything at all but if had to stand next to someone smoking tobacco or weed i pick the cigar guy every time
yes i do n’t want anyone going to jail for smoking weed in their homes or at an establishment that caters to it but i do n’t want to be assaulted with the smell of a dead skunk burning in a dumpster whenever i go anywhere outside in a downtown area
i agree this is the way
my wife rarely smokes weed but when she does she immediately takes a shower as she ca n’t stand the smell no way she ’d smoke in public the edibles that are low in thc are her choice
do n’t come to ny our law is rightfully anywhere you can smoke tobacco you can smoke cannabis when something is legal to do there should be no stigmas about where and when it can be done sure there are always going to be assholes who push the line and go too far but those fools do that with literally everything
and they were right to ban this
if they want to talk about the smell there is a small refinery near me and it reeks like rotten eggs and roadkill had a baby whenever i drive past it i have to roll up my windows and close all my air vents in the car for 10 minutes or i know i ’m not gon na get that smell out of my car for another few days
i smoke more weed than anybody but i 'm considerate about it like i am everything i do
hey only western kansas smells like that
manure from landscaped golf courses absolutely stinks around here right now it should be illegal to mulch golf courses which are just focus pits of odor our 's has the sharp smell of chemicals for hours after they spray every other day we live around a lot of water and it 's pretty much sand under them they have to dump excessive amounts of fertilizer to keep up straight up smells like cancer lol
i feel that way with cigarette smoke and alcohol beer cans in the street ’s cigarette butts and cigar buts everywhere
should we also make microwaving fish and not wearing deodorant a felony crime with schedule 1 penalties
are those the only 2 options
i do n't want to smell your shit breath as i 'm passing by so please outlaw breathing in public stupid people
you really want people to go to jail for making a smell you do n’t like that ’s pretty bad man
personally i do n't mind the smoke of tobacco but really dislike the smell of cannabis and i smoke neither if it matters but yeah this is a good reason for me to ask people not to smoke cannabis in my home not a good reason to imprison people for smoking cannabis
best post of the day
ron desantis has his head so far up trump ’s ass the only thing he can smell is putin ’s penis
underrated comment of the year
when i was at baylor back in the 1990s a student received a ticket from campus pd for public flatulence the incident ended up getting a bit of weird national attention but from what i recall the officer was just trying to avoid giving the kid a public intoxication citation which could have credited some bigger problems for him since the administration strenuously frowned on the consumption of alcohol by students
just outlaw air bro who needs it anyway
as an autistic person with smell based sensory issues this but unironically well semi unironically i would n't want it to actually be illegal
it ’s really not equatable i wish it was
i would argue that overuse of perfumes and body sprays can cause physical harm to others most places already regulate smoking to outside only and away from entrances so why can somebody bath in obnoxious perfumes and sit inside a public building or on mass transit and gas everyone around them with their foul chemical concoction i say this as somebody who has chronic migraines and that shit can take a migraine from 0 to 100 real quick at the very least going out in public smelling like the perfume counter at jcpenney should be a social fo paux just as much if not more than microwaving fish in the lunch room as for weed smell treat it the same as smoking cigarettes and its fine
gasoline exhaust smells way worse and has really negative health effects but sure let ’s ban a plant
same ca n't stand the smell but i 'll vote to legalize it 8 days a week regardless of how i feel about the smell a plant that has shown medical benefits should n't be illegal
i remember those bad old days in the late 90s when i 'd come home from hanging out with friends and bars and clubs and take a fucking shower before going to bed so i would n't wake up smelling completely of cigarette smoke
i 'm sure big tobacco has long been a big gop donor
yea vape pens they do n't stink
i think weed vapes are the answer to this i carry one on me or in my truck for use at my destinations do n't smoke and drive all day everyday no smell from the device itself and since the vapor is much lighter and does n't carry the tar resin that stinks and sticks to everything it does n't linger
and do n't worry once scentless cannabis is available the man will find something else to be outraged about and will keep trying to take marijuana away from the people it 's never about what they 're complaining about it 's always about control they 'll stoop to any level to ban stuff that people enjoy
good news trulieve has already invented shitty weed
that smell might not be the lingering smoke it might be the weed they 're holding
are you bragging or complaining
i do n't like bullets in the air but republicans keep telling us we have to just tolerate them
we live in a free country though liberty and freedom and all that repugnicans only whine about it when they want to take others freedom and liberty away why do n't they care about these noxious toxic things car exhaust contains harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons cigarette smoke a pervasive and toxic smell with harmful chemicals garbage and landfills decomposing waste produces foul odors industrial emissions factories and plants emit various pollutants with strong odors sewage and wastewater treatment plants emit unpleasant odors from waste processing gas stations the smell of gasoline and diesel fuel public restrooms often have strong unpleasant odors certain foods cooking foods like fish garlic and cabbage can produce strong smells construction sites asphalt tar and other materials have strong odors farm odors manure and other agricultural smells public transport buses and subways can have a mixture of various unpleasant smells cleaning chemicals strong smells from bleach ammonia and other cleaners perfumes and colognes strong fragrances can be overwhelming and unpleasant to some
the smell of flower is amazing i get why people do n't like smoke but the smell of the plant itself is incredible
i do nt enjoy the smell either but it 's no worse than cigarette smoke
it smells ghetto talk about a dog whistle
i do n't like the smell of cigarettes but if someone is smoking near me i might smell it i do n't like the smell of cow manure but if i pass by a farm i might smell it there 's a chemical plant near my house that smells like burning glue for an hour a day i do n't know what kind of bubble you want to live in but sorry you 're gon na smell unpleasant things sometimes in your life it smells ghetto fuck outta here with your nimby bullshit
i wish they would pass it for gummies i also support other people 's want to smoke it regardless if it smells or not cigars already smell terrible
while complaining about gas prices and the diesel “ is running out ” sheesh
if my smoking bothered anyone then i would just hope they ask me to change where i do it i 'm flexible i do n't want my neighbors to be unhappy
i kind of like the smell of cigars cigarettes smell like dirty stale ashtrays though i have a neighbor who keeps smoking cigarettes in their apartment and the whole stairway smells like shit i kinda smell weed sometimes but at least that goes away
actually cigarettes second hand is a know cancer causing source
weed smell goes away cigs stay forever
same comparing weed to other obnoxious smells like cigarettes or cigars is disingenuous it reeks and is 10 times stronger times square is a great example no one ever complained that it smelled like cigarettes but exit a taxi tonight and you are hit with an inescapable cloud of pot i ’m liberal progressive and fully support legalization with a ban in public places
fair enough how about goddard to garden city i 'll give you kc and wichita
agreed people are slobs i play golf and you would n't believe the number of people who spit sunflower seeds everywhere
just prohibit it and make it a 25 ticket or something there are options other than go to jail
that ’s fair and respectable that being said there are other means of consuming cannabis that these lawmakers are clearly omitting
oof you 're not wrong
do n't go giving the gop any ideas now
to be entirely clear i totally agree with you and am just making a point but fumes from burning poison ivy can maim or kill you that ’s just a plant too
ugh restaurants in the 90s with a smoking father were an endurance test
yep i have vaped standing next to a cop when it was illegal flower still has a better effect
edibles we ’ve already passed your accurate prediction
no it ’s the smoke can smell it on their breath too if you have a conversation
it seems like they ’re merely stating their personal experience
your liberty extends until it infringes on someone else ’s liberty this thread is a bunch of pot heads ignoring the obvious when they smoke in public they reek and it annoys the fuck out of non smokers and yes weed is waaaaaaay worse than even cigarettes for smell i ’m for legalization of weed but living in a weed legal state i also support fines for public smoking
you have some good points i would like weed legalized but not in public kind of like alcohol and cigarettes if you are at home or in a bar or in someone ’s house fine driving or operating machinery like restrictions for alcohol no not in public places like cigarettes i ’d be ok with that
i think we are on the same page about legalization i do n’t think people should be put in jail for years over marijuana i also do n’t think it should be everywhere smelling up the place either i think laws along the lines of alcohol and cigarettes would be fine and acceptable
it 's not worse for you
i said what i said
it does not it lingers for a very long time people that smoke may not smell it but people that do n’t smoke can smell it for a very long time also if you are just around people that smoke it gets on you too
well most of the project2025 people and putting online for all to read already if these are some of the worst ones already imagine what 's between those lines
flower has cbd many of the vape tanks do n't have any cbd and are only thc
i ’m saying not everyone feels good around cannabis cannabis made me nauseous since i was a kid i ca n’t work in a hemp farm or a dispensary or be around someone who ’s carrying a bag of weed
cigarette smoke is wayyyy worse for you than pot smoke just a simple fact of life
it is not worse than cigarettes one smells like a plant and one smells like a fucking chemical factory
cigarette smokers smell worse than weed smokers
what is next eradicate all the skunks out there because they smell like weed too lol the term potheads is bullshit you know cheech and chong were acting right that is n't how people who smoke weed actually act no one even knows if i smoked weed the smell of weed might be unpleasant to some it does n't necessarily infringe on their liberty more than any other common public smell
you can smoke cigs in public places outdoors what are you on about
yeah i do n't want to smell it in restaurants or bars just like i do n't want cigarette smoke give it similar rules for public use and be done
the cannabis advocacy community would likely support this and mostly want a reasonable live and let live outcome if someone has to be high at a dennys instead of stinking up the bathroom use edibles before arriving weed 's legal now enthusiasts need to be fucking adults about it
joints and blunts stink people that smoke like that are obnoxious sometimes if i hit a bong you 're not going to smell it on me
public smoking laws are needed not bans
i hate weed and especially tobacco smoke including vapes i always have edibles are much better
smoking anything is terrible for your lungs
word which is why they are banned and there are approximately 600 ingredients in cigarettes when burned cigarettes create more than 7 000 chemicals at least 69 of these chemicals are known to cause cancer and many are toxic weed is considered medical and cigs will never be
if there was a skunk wandering around down town vegas i ’d call animal control then wonder how the fuck it got out in the middle of the desert nothing is as pungent and strong as weed no perfume or cigarette comes close potheads refuse to acknowledge this they ’re as bad as the incels who do n’t bathe and claim they smell fine
i do n’t like cigarettes either i very rarely come into contact with cigarettes it ’s not like it used to be back before they started limiting smoking in the 90s i do n’t think treating weed like cigarettes is for instances like driving is ok but at home or bars and restaurants that allow smoking is fine i think the rules for weed should be somewhere between cigarettes and alcohol
it should be the combination of smoking and alcohol restrictions going to bars after they banned smoking indoors was sooooo much nicer there was something awful about going out and coming home reeking of cigarettes and blowing out black snot i 'm still going to vape in public because any hint of smell anyone might get is super muted i 'm going to smoke weed in my yard regardless hell on my front porch though i have a cemetery that borders 2 sides of my house and the house on the other side is always wafting cigarette smoke into my house so at most my further neighbors might get a faint wiff
edibles do not have the same effect as smoking it they might as well be two different drugs in that respect
pot has no tar i know people who have smoked pot for 60 years and have the exact same lungs as when they were teenagers who is michael phelps
lol there are approximately 600 ingredients in cigarettes when burned cigarettes create more than 7 000 chemicals at least 69 of these chemicals are known to cause cancer and many are toxic
but the parking garage at the airport does n’t smell like cigarettes it smells like smashed dead skunks left to rot i do n’t smoke anything but the simple objective fact is weed is far more smelly than tobacco products if you want to be high in public have an edible like an adult
that 's so naive you do know the eating and edible is not the same as smoking different process in breaking down through combustion vs digestion the result can be an edible making you unpredictable high because potency is really hard to control and the high last for hours some people also react badly to it as it can be way more intense so smoking becomes there only option also i hate the smell of gasoline but right now cars are necessary as we do n't have adequate public transit or ev established yes this infringes on my health far more especially as an asthmatic weed can actually be a bronchodilator when smoked meaning it can literally help people breath fumes from gasoline or cigarettes have 0 benefits and stink not only that but the fumes from cigarettes will embed themselves in fabrics and wall paint etc it 's a big reason you ca n't smoke in a hotel but that does n't happen with weed smoke sure it 'll sink for a bit but it 'll blow away and air out unless your smoking thc vape then the smell is usually flavored like vapes so it does n't smell like skunk and lasts a few seconds before the smell dissipates it 's funny telling a people who consume potheads and calling them names for refusing to understand your dislike for the smell no we understand you dislike it but compared to all the other smells that are actually harmful and we dislike you ignore which is incredible hypocritical and your uneducated in the science behind cannabis combustion smoke thc vap pens dry herb vapor vs cigarette smoke
i wonder if it 's because trump ignored all the questions and spent his time blaming other people for his failures
trump did n’t add anyone he just reminded america that he ’s an unhinged hysterical fraud
i mean biden performed “ poorly ” but trump came out and showed he ’s still “ trump ” not sure many folks are crazy about voting for a guy whom claims without proof that the dems are allowing for late term and “ post term ” abortions trump presented nothing new for undecideds than what they have already seen that does n’t even mention the litany of crimes he is currently indicted for i think most folks are just waking up to the bite of the shit sandwich we are going to have to take this time around and are grumpy about it the dems could toss a literal flaming pile of dog shit on the stage and it ’d still get my vote because it ’s not going to try and destroy our democracy
tbh i think biden helped himself a bit today when he acknowledged his age and that he did poorly during the debate self awareness about such things is good
the best thing about joe biden is that he was president for 4 years and i rarely thought about him
i rather vote for someone who may stumble stammer and look old while trying to debate rather than someone who lied for the entire debate but that ’s me i ’m decided but i ’m guessing if undecided voters made the switch to biden even after last night maybe they are being pragmatic and smart
a group of undecided latino voters said they would vote for president joe biden after watching his thursday night debate with former president donald trump while this is still positive the title is intentionally misleading biden was winning the latino vote regardless 90 % of trumps points were about how hispanic immigrants were trying to destroy the country
i am going to wait for the next polling just because
do i think the debate went badly for biden sure but i also think that almost everyone has already made up their minds i think the truth of the matter is that biden is an 81 year old man who is doing the hardest most demanding job on the planet sometimes he just does n't have the zest that we 're used to seeing in the office but it does n't mean he just sits in the oval office drooling into his oatmeal biden at his nc rally right after the debate was like his old self he was loud forceful joked with crowd did n't stumble or stutter but you 'll never see that on the news because it does n't help ratings if i were running the biden campaign right now i would be scheduling a series of townhalls where the biden in nc today can speak directly to the people that 's always been his strength and it would allow people to say ok he sucked at the debate but he 's killing it with these forums so it must have been a weird fluke
newsweek is trash the headline suggests voters at large have expressed that opinion but the article is about a particular group of latino voters i ’d like to take the headline at face value because it ’s reassuring but newsweek is being deceptive as usual in order to profit from clicks
as someone voting for biden there ’s no fuckin way this must be an onion article
i have a theory about a pity vote and the slower person in the debate benefitting from that role in the reagan mondale debates in 1984 reagan was barely clinging to complex thoughts and grammatical coherence he was cognitively present but with effort he also seemed to be someone who had never been verbally nimble in his best days u s voters do n't like to pick on the cognitive underdog because they are generally poorly informed insecure about their own school record and easily intimidated by big words rightly or not they identify with the less articulate person in a debate plus more charitably we tend to feel that passing judgment on the slower person in an exchange is just bad manners i think reagan benefitted from this both in debates and in his public appearances more generally his values are okay he 's a decent guy he 's trying same for george w bush john fetterman and in 2016 donald trump in the 2016 debates trump was the dummy rather than the whiny liar as the dummy trump was not burdened by the brand of the malevolent whining self serving hypocrite which now sticks to him because people had not yet seen him in action for 4 years last night biden was the dummy the reagan he 's far from sharp but he means well and he 's trying trump he 's both stupid and evil bleah
he may not have been great or even good but he did n't just spend the whole time lying and whining like the other guy
donald trump is still donald trump and people remember that people remember charlottesville people remember roe being overturned people remember january 6th people remember the incompetent covid response i know that people were hoping that biden would knock trump 's dick in the dirt but he did n't have to nobody 's opinion was changed based on last night
still voting for biden over trump
the fact that any minorities support trump boggles my mind as a white person who hears racist shit said around me let me say this to minorities they are using you you ai n’t invited to the afterparty
even some democrats have called for the party to reconsider its options including andrew yang who ran against biden for the nomination in 2020 because yang was the portrait of clarity and and sanity during his campaign sure
this sub is an atrocious source of information
wait this article is actually garbage i thought they did some polling but it literally was just some small handful of people they had watching the debate that ’s a crazy misleading headline
voting blue no matter who nothing would hurt america more than idiot trump and his tinfoil hat gop sheep getting back into power vote blue in every race up and down the ballot never give up
this is basically a study done asking a a roomful of people that could have very easily been cherry picked this is pure copium and not even scientifically relevant copium
people need to remember that if you vote in biden or trump you are n’t just voting for the president you are voting for the entire group of people that come with them i would much rather have a democratic entourage than a republican one our democracy depends on it
if you click the link you 'll see this was 12 non random hispanic voters not a survey of undecided voters no idea why this is the top post on r politics but it seems like the people on here do n't want to deal with reality
dems really gon na put blinders on just to lose this election huh
if you read the article this was an informal group of some latino voters i ’m not gon na sit here and act happy about the debate because 6 voters have changed their minds
trump basically told people that things they saw with their own eyes never actually happened i did n't say that really there 's video proof from your rally on jan 6th where you told them to march to the capital and fight like hell i never slept with a pornstar um did n't the courts prove that beyond any doubt
i am 100 % a democrat and i do n't believe this this is spin to try and quiet all the noise the scotus decisions released today are just one more reminder of the seriousness of this election bring in a new quarterback
trump just did a stump speech in sections without answering any questions
god i hope this is true and that it turns out not to be so bad because trump came off as untrustworthy and that 's far worse than stumbling on your words
but trump had the best h2o and the best numbers
this is the first time i 'm commenting on the debate i did n't watch it but i 'll be voting for biden even if i were the only person to
the fact that these latino voters were undecided in the first place is a joke trump 's racism for the past 8 years was n't enough for them to vote biden
i ’d rather vote for dogshit than trump
biden fumbled last night but he spoke the truth and got his points across trump just lied and got deranged
headline should read undecided voters say donald trump 's 4 years in office were worse than watching 90 minutes of last night 's debate
biden is good at some things bad at others he 's great at getting major bills passed probably the best legislative record since lbj he 's also great at hiring people his administration has been remarkably stable his foreign policy moves have been remarkably successful the untold story of his presidency so far among many others he 's terrible at using the bully pulpit to lead the country and generally a terrible communicator which means he ca nt create unity in the country that s bad and its why trump has a chance he also will rely on staff maybe too much in a potential second term since he is slowed down by age altogether he 's a decent flawed choice for president that deserves reelection i wo n't be upset if he steps down but i will rally for him until the moment that happens
it ’s because they watched it on univision voices were dubbed
now that ’s a cope lol
really i mean i ’m glad to hear that but really
it drove me nuts when he was talking about jan 6 and went on about how he offered troops to nancy pelosi and she turned them down so he ca n't be blamed for what happened nancy pelosi is not the commander in chief it drove me more nuts when joe did n't go after him for it
immigrants abortion immigrants inflation immigrants democracy immigrants national debt immigrants dammit
i wish the moderators had pushed back on that a bit infinitely more at the very start he asks can i respond to that and they say no sir we 're asking a different question and i 'm like good excellent keep him on topic but then almost every subsequent question he 'd just pivot to completely unrelated talking points and rare was the occasion where the moderators would admonish him did he ever even try to address how his insane deportation operations would work or did the mods just let it go
trump was handed an easy putt to win last night with joe 's performance but still insisted on pulling out a driver and smashing it into the parking lot with his ramblings full of lies and nonsense
millions and millions of murderers and rapists
i think it 's because when you compare the feedback from the debate there is a clear difference between the two of them neither is great but trump came off as insane
this was not the slam dunk the media portrays it as but this particle article also discusses latinos two things to note about their audience 1 this audience was people who did not have english as their first language and were watching with captions in spanish that made them more substance oriented actually reading the discussion 2 trump turned this voters off by calling them rapists and murderers who were stealing ' black jobs ' racial minorities are of course much more likely to care about the abhorrent racism of trump than the white elites running the newspapers
he only ' won ' the debate because biden shit the bed trump sounded confident and strong compared to biden but if you listened to his words they were just bile and lies banging the same ' american sucks now ' drum most people would take the old dude over the slightly younger crazy man
i could n’t get over that i ’m 32 the first time i remember hearing about elections was george w bush vs al gore in 2000 ever since then i ’d catch news of future elections on tv in passing it was n’t until obama ’s first campaigns that i paid actual attention they always seemed to be a level of decorum these are older rich fancy people and they ’re not gon na outright lie to our faces or sit there like kindergartners going “ na uh that ’s a lie it ’s your fault you did it it was n’t me it ’s all you ” but bruhhhhhhh wtf has the last 8 years been wtf the us has always been a shit show but obama knew how to put lipstick on a pig and pass it off but last night bro how did we get here
and telling people how terrible america is i for one am fond of my nation i ’m sure there ’s lots of others who would agree
biden stumbled to answer questions trump only answered questions about immigration regardless of what the question was actually about
he literally called low paying positions black jobs and people are complaining about biden
i 'm voting for biden regardless but seeing trump do his bullshit last night makes me not want to hear that shit again for 4 more years it was exhausting hearing all the media coverage on him daily even trying to tune it out you still hear it from people at work
from the article one man said he would vote for biden because trump sounded like a crazy liar ” the man being interviewed also said trump said the same thing time after time and was not answering questions or saying how he would fix things ”
i agree but unfortunately the media including supposed center left outlets are all yelling about how biden needs to step aside barely a whisper about trump 's rate of 1 lie every 75 seconds and that 's only counting the first time he told a given lie not the repeats
in the most recent times siena poll carried out by the new york times and the siena college research institute 45 percent of hispanic people said they would vote for biden and 44 percent said trump in the 2020 election trump received 32 percent of the latino vote up from the 28 percent he received in 2016 bro he ’s even amongst hispanics
i spent this entire day feeling gaslit by all these stories about what an alleged disaster biden 's debate performance was maybe it would have been in a sane election not vs trump though
there are a few who do believe him my bio dad 100 % believes that not only do blue states allow post birth abortions they do so to basically any age with the parent 's permission further he thinks that new york is a dystopian hell hole where black people can drive down the street and spray the sidewalks with full automatic fire killing literally hundreds each daily and the police just shrug and no nothing because no da or judge will sentence them i asked him how many people he thinks die in new york each day to this and he said literally thousands so yeah vote because people like him are
“ the democrat party aborted you when you were two years old there ’s twenty illegal immigrants in your house right now with fentanyl guns who want to steal your tax cuts my tax cuts the biggest tax cuts in history putin who ’s a very bad guy but he listens to me i told him “ no ukraine no israel ” but joe biden who ’s a palestinian from china he wants a lockdown and open borders all the experts are saying it all of them can you believe it ”
i read that he did n’t flat out say he ’d accept the election results is that true it ’s bizarre that the question is even asked
honestly the first half i thought trump did a decent job of not being classic trump it was relatively quiet and answering questions and not name calling etc that did n’t last long though lol
definitely better than forgetting you banged a pornstar who you compared to your daughter
his speech today was insanely good
i think you could tell he was pissed off about the reaction one bad performance and everyone is calling for him to be removed plus his audience today fucking loved him and he was even working the crowd that and with funding going up since the debate i think his demise was over exaggerated
definitely that and even if he did poorly everything he said was good just not presented well
may we live in boring times
yes make politics boring again they just need to get on with governing and running the country the shitshow of the trump years and the absolute circus of the republicans in the senate in these past few years benefits absolutely no one
yup i do n't have to watch the news every day to see what the fucking idiot trump did to our country now or to embarrass us guess that 's why cnn is on trump 's side and allowed his lies
exactly no tweets no 23 7 news article
i was so frustrated biden gave statistics and trump would just go nuh huh i was better 150 historians ranked you as the worst president trump nuh huh i am the greatest president ever
you are an informed voter normal people might only watch this debate as their only insight into who to vote for other than whatever they see on social media as in see propaganda as the saying goes imagine how stupid the average person is then remember you got 49 % of people dumber than they are trump wins by voter apathy which is exactly what biden helped do last night
you would be surprised how many latino people support trump especially in states like florida
in the most recent times siena poll carried out by the new york times and the siena college research institute 45 percent of hispanic people said they would vote for biden and 44 percent said trump this is n't a very comfortable lead
yeah this is a small group from a specific demographic and trying to use it to portray the average voter a more diverse nyt panel i was reading about was all over the place on their reactions to the debate this is not an accurate sample of anything other than to say well at least these people saw thru trump ’s bs
biden is barely winning the latino vote make of that what you will
it 's not even a poll it 's a dozen people interviewed in a room on tv newsweek is ridiculous with their titles without context you 'd think this was some 1200 sample size pollster data
yeah this headline is bs
but i also think that almost everyone has already made up their minds most have made up their minds who they would vote for between the two but a lot of people still hvae to make up their minds on election day whether they 're going to get off their ass and actually cast their vote
yep and i 'd let the gang come and make the occasional answers as well do joint town halls with kamala gavin pete and yes even bernie have jill answer at least one question every town hall as well show people this is a team that works together
it ’s not just the president it ’s the staff that come along and trumps going to bring out the absolute worst and the court just reminded us of that today
almost is the operative word swing voters are a real thing and they got their name for a reason
it also seems to be 14 random latino undecided voters so who knows whether it 's representative or not edit check 35 m which shows most being undecided still
newsweek is trash 100 % agree saw a post in another sub about a year ago citing a poll from newsweek that said approximately 40 % of high school kids identified as trans now as someone with a statistics background the alarms went off and i went into detail as to why the poll should be ignored but yeah newsweek will print anything for clicks
headline undecided voters say they now support joe biden after debate first line a group of undecided latino voters said they would vote for president joe biden it was a focus group on univision this entire article is based on a tweet sharing a clip of that focus group the tweet was from a biden senior advisor did n't newsweek used to be ok journalism at some point
the article says “ a group of undecided latino voters ” said they will vote for biden it ’s not a poll it ’s not a survey it ’s literally like 10 latino voters in a room and newsweek spins this as “ undecided voters say ” and of course reddit eats it up because they need a copium injection stat
yeah people are delusional this was a disaster for biden if this was not the case these presidents would not feel the obligation to tweet
i live in a mixed politics area of ca south orange county and this is not the response i ’ve received by some of my independent centrist friends if anything it did the opposite i ’m still voting biden but truly hoping he steps down and lets another candidate run
same did we watch the same debate no one won last night especially the american people
i have a theory about a pity vote and the slower person in the debate benefitting from that role i have a theory that anyone still undecided probably ca n't tell the difference between incoherent stammering and a complex policy position when things get confusing they just blank out
reagan did n't benefit from that debate reagan was already a shoe in to win that debate was a disaster for him yet mondale 's polling rose to something like 8 points behind reagan he never had a chance of winning because reagan was an incumbent running on a recovered economy after the savings and loan crisis
it 's the grandpa effect the contrast between understandably slower old man vs raving lunatic is siding with your sweet grandfather and not your crazy 9 11 conspiracy uncle
trump tried to say that charlotteville was falsely reported last night and it was n't full of nazi sympathizers folks are so caught up with bidens performance that they are n't talking about the absolutely insane lies trump gave last night straight up bullshit spewing from his mouth
they are more christian than most demographics and the gop has tied itself to that religion enough to affect them
do n't forget there 's deep racism in minorities which is very commonly brought through their background and in many times severe ignorance they will vote against their own interests as long as he 's a christian man or a conservative like in the good old days before the commies back home in the 60s 70s and 80s source racist hispanic family members black and middle eastern friends
how the fuck are they going to cite yang here when bro literally left and made his own political party
yang was just about the first one to drop out and endorse biden in 2020 so he could have a consulting gig with cnn dude is just an opportunistic parasite who says whatever he thinks will further his career regardless of how hypocritical the next statement out of his mouth will be
newsweek being allowed at all is just proof the mod team does n’t give a shit about politics news or authenticity
this place is designed to push a narrative
that 's because information is n't the goal of the sub lol r politics literally only exists as a propaganda platform
this place is reaching the donald levels of delusion never thought i would see it from the other side very depressing
we had like a 12 hour period where people were finally starting to realize and openly admit that biden is not the right choice but less than 24 hours later and were heading back to our regularly scheduled program amazing
as george costanza once said it ’s not a lie if you believe it
honestly how funny would that be if that s what won him the election
the people that knew those were lies are n't undecided
not to mention that the speaker of the house is not the person in charge of security she could n't have accepted that offer even if he 'd actually made it
that was trump 's way of baiting biden and that time biden did n't bite
she 's also literally on video with either the sec of defense or the chief of staff to trump i forget asking pleading really for the national guard to be sent this is n't an ambiguous point at all
he also said fight like hell in his speech he incited that shit for months in various forms of media and direct quotes very easy to pick some highlights and dates and paint that little portrait in a debate
trump what are my feelings on abortion there ’s a blood thirsty immigrant family waiting under your bed with covid and nine machetes right fucking now and joe biden with the worst administration in the history of this country put them there not a single machete wielding covid immigrant was under your bed under my administration cnn thank you president trump
“ after birth abortions they ’re going to put those babies aside and decide what to do with them later ” what in the ever lovin fuckin christ
and joe had and easy af answer on immigration too biden admin supported the bipartisan bill that would have strengthened processes to better catch these illegal killers and rapists but trump said no dont pass it i mean how cut and dry can it possibly be but biden had a helluva time getting that point across just as much as trump hammered the immigration lies smh
immigrants taking black and latino jobs what ’s a black or latino job racist fuck he is
honestly if someone does n’t see him as facist after last night they ’re the problem
even worse they would ask the question again and give him even more air time to talk about other unrelated stuff
cnn is owned by a conservative now so really unsurprising this happened they let him skirt 3 really important questions about the creation of a state of israel palestine i forget which denouncing j6 and abortion i believe
“ may i suggest answering the questions ” plink “ you have selected whinging dumbass ”
i simply ca n’t believe we ’re aborting babies after birth it ’s 2024
morons always sound confident that 's not a good way to measure competence
i too can sound confident in a debate if i ignore the questions and just recite some random talking points that may or may not be true
i have nothing but contempt for anyone who thinks lying openly brazenly shamelessly and confidently is winning a debate
i felt sorry for biden and it increased my resolve a president does n’t have to make snap decisions he can take five minutes to think and word his decisions in such a way that maximizes the benefit if he has less than five minutes to make a decision that ’s probably nuclear annihilation and we already have protocols in place for that he probably just has to signal the ok so i ’m happy that biden is president dude is fighting actual fascism at his age and whether or not he ’s right to have put himself in that situation in the first place that ’s over so i ’m donating getting involved generally taking this more seriously every bit helps and i do n’t want democracy to end because an old guy had a bad debate
we got here because billionaires created a hundred problems to detract our attention from the fact that they were taking over democracy an inch at a time
yeah that 's the thing biden had a higher degree of difficulty because he was actually trying to respond to what the moderator said
on the what will you do to slow the climate crisis question trump 's response began with something about police officers confused hillary clinton and joe biden on the superpredators comment ranted about historically black colleges praised tim scott ended with illegal immigrants are taking jobs if anyone in your orbit gave that response when the topic is climate change you immediately want their brain examined but for some reason the guy who understands we need to take action before we hit the 1 5c tipping point was n't sharp is the takeaway of the debate
ca n’t believe this is n’t called out more he called em black and hispanic jobs and he said that illegal immigrants are stealing their jobs but yeah biden was sick and tired so apparently trump is better
media pundits whose job is to attract clicks and retweets are complaining about biden cnn can fucking eat my hairy ass
i could n’t believe he did n’t get called out for that
when he said that i wished biden had asked him to “ please give examples of black jobs ”
it gave me a level of anxiety i have not experienced for several years
do n't forget a vote for biden is also a vote against project 2025
i turned it on just as he was going on about how some states wants to legalize abortion post birth and turned it back off he 's just telling blatant lies to rile up his base facts do n't matter it 's exhausting
a thing i hope people realize with voting for biden is that the worst thing they can happen is simply needing to be replaced by his vp that 's it i trust that biden could do that if unable to perform his duties i trust the vp to lead the country well enough until 2028 trump is another story he would only ever want to go down with the ship and would never step down his narcissism would never allow it and he needs the presidency to protect and enrich himself he fully intends to lead the country into uncharted and destructive waters and i only expect his vp to do the same biden 's situation is not ideal but our choices are n't between two ideal or even reasonable options people have to stop characterizing this election as if it were otherwise it 's a vote on setting the direction for america and not simply for someone to sit in the oval office and look pretty
all he does is lie without any specifics ever everything he did was the best thing ever and everything biden does is the worst thing ever it ’s exhausting hearing him constantly spew that fucking rubbish
i still have a viscerally negative reaction to hearing trump speak no idea what it is but i ca n't listen to him for any length of time
i just ca n't believe how he or anyone else for that matter can continue to say the left wants babies aborted even after they are born literally murder and still be taken seriously the mental gymnastics it must take to think that any sane person wants that is mind boggling
totally agree i did n’t watch the debate i ’m not american it ’s still giving me anxiety just hearing about it
same here i felt assaulted by bs
trump 's rate of 1 lie every 75 seconds that seems generous
1 every 75 seconds must be the average over course of night when he was actually talking he was spewing between 10 20 lies a minute from what i heard
obviously because reporting on trumps lies is reporting the sky is blue
not to mention his excellent performance in nc
they love the drama that trump brings to the table
latino and hispanic are not interchangeable terms they often overlap but they 're not the same that said latino voters are very incumbent preferred swing y voters anecdotally families who have been in the us for a few generations seem to trend republican
catholics they are accustomed to having leaders that rape and lie
have you considered aborting him
to be honest i did step outside today and get gunned down by automatic fire here in manhattan i ’m writing this from the street where i ’m currently bleeding out the ambulance has n’t gotten to me yet because there are so many illegal immigrants stealing jobs that traffic is completely halted tell my mom that
bio dad 100 % believes that not only do blue states allow post birth abortions they do so to basically any age with the parent 's permission a post birth abortion is called the death penalty does he have a problem with the death penalty because it 's red states who support that not blue blue states are the lily livered softies who do n't kill people remember per capita it 's not blue
i ’ve always said i ’m pro choice up to age 12 but apparently i need to tell people now that i ’m actively doing a bit
i feel you and it is amazing how strong the fox news influence is on older people i literally live in nyc and my bio dad literally visits me and sees our young children playing with the other kids in our neighborhood he has even called it idyllic then he goes home watches fox news and then tells me i need to leave the city because it 's not safe what about your time in my neighborhood oh that 's just your neighborhood the rest of it is n't safe what if the rest of the city is like my neighborhood no i just saw on the news ok please vote
i ’m sorry to hear this about your father both my bio dad and adoptive dad are were the same way not sure about your situation but neither of mine bother ed to travel outside their rural towns much and spend spent their days in front of the tv consuming the conservative media narrative i remember being 12 and discussing the possibility of someone like trump taking power with my adoptive dad a stanch conservative and he was adamant at the time that it could never happen in the system we created due to how one has to negotiate to wield the power they are given but here we are
it 's something you 're sold when you 're raised in a right wing bubble i know because i was raised in such a bubble i had the focus on the family bullshit crammed down my throat from an early age right down to the brio subscription and wooden spoon ptsd yes all that crazy shit you hear about what the right says about abortion is 100 % what my husband and i believed until our mid 20s when we got married and went out into the world on our own thankfully we escaped out respective bubbles other family members did n't
i feel this my mother swallowed the red pill decades ago but i was truly shocked when she abandoned all reason for trump looking back i think the harshest thing i ’ve ever said to her was “ mom i just do n’t get it i ’ve always considered you an intelligent well read and just in general a strong independent woman who has always known a scam when she sees one i now have my doubts ” we get along wonderfully we just agreed right there that we ’d not discuss it again and we ’ve not since 2016 but at least with her it was more her and her husband leaning into the idea that he ’s going to look out for american businesses and just cut the bullshit and get things done all that stuff about him being a criminal and a traitor well that ’s just all radical left bullshit according to them right on agree to disagree everyone please fucking vote
my bio dad 100 % believes that not only do blue states allow post birth abortions if my parent said that to me the conversation would n't survive the next sentence which would be a demand that they define post birth abortion
no offense but i think your bio dad has lost touch with reality
if you mean trump he said he would “ accept the results but only as long as it is a free and fair election ” thing is with trump anything but a “ win ” means it was “ rigged and unfair ”
he did n't last time why would he this time it 's not bizarre it was asked but it 's a fucking disgrace that it has to be
correct he said he ’d accept them if he thought it was fair so basically a no i ’ve never seen him admit something that goes against him was fair everything is always rigged ’
the question was asked because trump attempted a coup last time he lost an election
yeah he actually dodged it twice the moderators repeated the question for him he started to say it but then he pivoted over to some crazy bullshit about how amazing america was on jan 6th
he 's never answered yes to that question 2016 it 's i 'll accept if i win 2020 it 's we 'll see
i honestly was a little shocked at how well trump self refrained and composed himself during the debate it was probably the weeks on end he spent in his criminal trial not being allowed to speak that helped him prepare the most in this regard
as soon as biden called him a loser he went full rally mode and never looked back
he 's thinking back like wait was that actually not ivanka i was on so much cocaine i ca n't remember
denying he had sex with a porn star probably hurt him while trump lies a lot c'm on we all know he did it we 've known for a while now even his supporters know and have said they just did n't care but how do you reconcile a lie that big when it 's basically public knowledge at this point had trump just dismissed it as unimportant or hell even acknowledged it it probably would have played better denial though i think that was one lie a bit too big to go down but here 's the thing even if you sided with trump over stormy daniels if he lies and you know he 's lied you 've now established in a lot of people 's minds that he 's lied about it just knowing he 's lied and lied blatantly and nonchalantly about it what else has he lied about and people just did n't pay attention simply because he was confident enough to be convincing obviously for non trump supporters we 've been calling this out but facts did n't even matter if people believe people are lying about trump lying they can just ignore it they can ignore fact checks because it comes from the liberal media and could be biased but when there was a huge public trial where it 's been firmly established he 's made the payments how do you reconcile that with him saying bald faced that he did n't do it funny enough it might have been the bridge too far for a lot of people also while biden performed poorly trump did n't look great either the lies saying biden was going to kill babies after they were born hurling insults rather than focusing on policy he really did n't come off great
got a link by chance i must have missed it
just watching it now he sounds completely different than he did last night what a good night 's sleep can do for a head cold eh
if biden wins the election that speech will be the moment the gets played over and over and over again it will have been the biden moment of the campaign
obviously biden had a crap performance but the catastrophizing has been prepostrous with all the shit that 's going to hit the fan in between now and the election i doubt anyone will even remember this debate by then i 'm personally of the opinion that nothing really matters much until after trump 's sentencing on the 11th
just remember that most of the people that decided to vote for trump were always going to vote for him there 's been multiple posts on r conservative from flipped liberals whose post histories are pure conservative nonsense
“ you ’re like the worst ever in the history of ever by the way there are 25 million south americans killing 25 millions babies every day when they are n’t stealing black jobs ”
hit the nail on the head we are headed for another 2016
there are still a few things still at play here one is that trump is going to be sentenced next month for his new york conviction that will undoubtedly make headlines and considering how much the judge hates trump ’s guts there ’s a very strong chance he ’ll face real consequences the other thing is that trump ’s base skews older and that ’s a demographic that has been continually whittled down from covid and other age related issues finally trump is just scary the whole gop is but trump is an especially aggressive crazy mother fucker and everyone outside of magaworld knows it these things alone will drive a percentage of voters into biden ’s camp finally give it a few days for people to cool off dem voters tend to be skittish they we get anxious and forgive me fatalistic over a politician ’s performance at the best of times but last night has everyone breaking out into hives more than normal so the race is hardly won but it ’s not like trump has it in the bag either
cubans and puerto ricans are surprisingly racist against central and south americans cubans are also hella catholic and big on anti abortion
i hear from my hispanic family that lives in fl that venezuelans love trump like wtf ppl what a lot of hispanics do n’t realize is that when he denigrates mexicans he is talking about all hispanics not just mexicans it drives me nuts to hear hispanic ppl supporting that asshole biden could ’ve fallen asleep at the debate and i ’d still vote for him fuck that orange pos
and it ’s not even a large sample size if you think about it at least the size that ’ll matter in november there are plenty of hispanics who are conservative leaning and the hispanic population is growing closer to 50 % every 5 years or so let ’s hope things sway before november
100 % this is just newsweek showing it 's hand and pushing it 's own narrative
yeah the debate hurt biden but it ’s not like trumps skyrocketing through the polls making misleading titles like this will result in more damage than good
people always underestimate the conservative population with latinos and blacks
this is n't just a politics thing but i love entire articles written around a single tweet lmao
i never believe headlines from newsweek new republic or business insider click bait headlines all of them
this is something a large portion of the comments are conveniently ignoring a lot of coping going on around these parts i will be surprised if the polls do n’t take a hit but i would love to be wrong
people here are really eating it up too lol
just to make it worse a group of undecided latino voters said they would vote for president joe biden is followed shortly after by but some latino voters said otherwise why are we so endlessly taken in by such utterly shit content it 's so abundantly clear that most top level comments have n't read the article to see how shit and vague it is it 's just so stupid and unnecessary and exhausting
and here it is right at the top of r politics good lord this sub is like a bad sitcom
yeah this post is pure copium no way that performance help biden
that 's true most of the online chatter i 've seen outside of reddit is that people thought the whole thing was a mess including trump maybe a lot of people do sit this one out or vote 3rd party idk it 's hard to say at this point
yeah there are tons of things team biden can do to do damage control and restore confidence but they have to take back the narrative and get him out there at their own events
include whitmer in a pinch she ’s the only backup candidate capable of winning mi wi and pa
this sub will cope until election day and then blame progressives for the outcome lol
i hate this theory but it would explain things a bit how anyone could be undecided is beyond me
i thought democrats acknowledged reality it ’s really sad to see that is not the case here
bruh even uninformed voters know americans are not doing post birth abortions maybe if you count racists lynching people for their skin color as post birth abortions then yeah fuck the racists too
he went a bit too far even for him though i had to turn it off after a few minutes because i could n't stand the moderators letting him do it
biden 's presentation was abysmal but once you figured out what he was getting at it all made sense trump was spewing actual nonsense obviously the perception of biden is the bigger issue but he did technically win the actual debate
cnn sir you still have 38 seconds the question was about abortion trump absolutely and listen nobody has cared more about the black population than i have and they have benefited the most under me than under any other president since lincoln but under biden their jobs are being replaced by immigrants immigrants are taking black jobs like you know trash collection and such cnn thank you president trump
why did they keep calling him president he is n’t one has n’t been one in 4 years and has n’t been elected one wtf the disrespect to the actual sitting president that ’s standing right tf there
he claimed many times that a lot of abortions were performed after birth which you know is called murder
this is directly related to the governor of virgina i believe he was discussing palliative care for newborns who were born with life ending and soon to be fatal deformities and issues but it sounds better to say after birth abortions than finding a solution to end suffering
so after looking into it the original quote was almost certainly about infant hospice in the cases where a late term abortion was attempted due to severe fetal defects and the baby was born alive the quote also mentions infant resuscitation if that 's what the parents choose yes infant hospice is a thing it 's tragic and you 're going to need more of it if you ban abortion
it ’s better than putting them back in
is that a real quote
this is what blew my mind so many conservatives have no idea trump had mike johnson kill that bill in congress so trump could run on immigration it amazes me how little so many voters actually know about what is going on biden had the opportunity to drive some truths home but seemed too exhausted to be effective last night i could n't even understand what biden was saying half of the time
“ we now return to cnns 2 hour live trump rally ”
he also completely ducked questions regarding the cost of childcare which is something that many average americans are facing this fat orange thing can not possibly lead he brags about taking a cognitive test given to people with dementia
and he pulled the same shit regarding honoring the election results kept wandering off topic and then basically said only if i say they 're fair
i get this reference and i love it
unfortunately the average american responds uncritically to the loudest voice in the room
the new except this time we do n't have people like smedley butler
i ’m not american and i was surprised how bad the press was for biden immediately following the debate i watched it and at least he largely stayed on topic and answered questions with facts he could provide numbers to he ’s not charismatic or quick witted and he came off old and frail but he did answer most questions a big problem imo was that he let himself down to trump ’s level at times instead of staying on topic so parts of the debate were really at toddler level and he does n’t have the charisma to get away with stooping to that level trump carries himself in an overconfident manner but he did not actually answer any questions he did n’t say anything of substance or truth and frequently spoke in hyperbole it ’s like in interviews where not the person with the best answers gets the job but the person who ’s best at talking confidently even if what they say is utter bs
i ’m going to be one of those guys this biden pushback is in no way normal things just do n’t swing that hard over night biden has done things that people mocked did n’t like before this is something else it feels like a campaign almost who was saying “ man biden should drop out giving the presidency to trump ” before yesterday now it ’s every other fucking comment and you would think by how bad people are taking it like biden has never done anything right in the last 4 years here ’s the way i see it a it is true everyone has bad days b bad days are probably worse at his age c yes this probably means he ’s a bit too old d trump is almost as old and can not be healthier i just do n’t believe it he ’s just had 20 years building this character and learning to cover it up f just because trump said things louder and more clearly does not mean what he said gets a little pass he quiet literally did n’t answer one question straight on always either dodging or going into his favorite topics e people need to just chill for a day this is not the end if i had to guess this will have very little to do with how the election goes this is fucking june we sometimes do n’t even know who the candidate is yet there is still a long long election to go
it 's blowing up more in the black corners of the internet than in mainstream publications
and he almost said that they ’ll be after the white jobs next
do people not remember that donald trump has already been the president he had a disastrous presidency where he heaped praise on our enemies botched a pandemic response and blatantly committed treason and insurrection
ca n’t believe they ignored this no general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country afghanistan where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated and by the way we left people behind too we left american citizens behind when putin saw that he said you know what i think we ’re going to go in and maybe take my this was his dream i talked to him about it his dream the difference is he never would have invaded ukraine never trump straight up admitted he is a traitor
i could n’t watch it because it gave me so much anxiety and i hate his voice and it ’s not really anxiety for me i ’m past childbearing years it ’s for my daughters my granddaughters my nieces etc i ’m scared for all of y’ all
he has literally given the whole world anxiety it probably can be measured because his whole strategy is to sow chaos and he does it well
i thought i was the only one
yo same i was straight up worried my dad was watching and giving himself an actual heart attack
same was shaking i ca n’t handle another 4 years of trump
right closest to a panic attack that i 've been in 30 years
more than four years of daily coverage of his ramblings as media pundits did everything they could to spin his word salad into some kind of cogent meaningful sane statement day after day after day it was exhausting
i 'm trans in texas my boomer in laws who absolutely are n't voting for trump or any republican at this point wanted to watch the debate i 'm on the far end of the room trying to not hear it and i ended up having to just go outside it was so distressing my 25 year old kid noticed and came out to check on me i can not handle that fucker i 'm only in this shit hole state for family and because moving would absolutely wreck us but if he wins i wo n't have a chance
i had to turn it off i was getting so infuriated and my anxiety was going nuts because of him vote blue
this needs to be said more and much louder
i need to see what all the hubbub is about on this
actually most republicans support abortion post birth and claim a second amendment right to carry the implements necessary for the procedure with them at all times
exactly i 'd feel much better with a president harris than a supreme leader trump
lol this i was listening to the debate and being like ok he just said 5 things he did were the best and 5 things biden did were the worst without providing any particular substance behind those claims
and he has 19 people telling him how he never said something that obviously triggered him during the debate
same just the sound of his voice is abhorrent to me
they 're referring to deformed non viable fetuses that briefly survive leaving the womb anti abortion people claim everything possible must be done to save them even if they are missing vital organs and ca n't possibly survive off life support example
and as usual the media spin was “ biden bad ” so sick and tired of corporate media ’s bias toward trump glad the polls are showing the debate was n’t the campaign ender all the doomers have been angsting on about
probably still includes the time his mic was muted too
at the nc rally biden sounded downright normal and articulate he still had a little cough but delivered his address quite passionately and forcefully
and the increase in clicks on ' biden must step aside ' versus ' biden shows poor performance in debate '
i mean its a mercy at that point
the ol' 200th trimester abortion lmao
he ’d need parental permission so it ’d be tough
are you by any chance on 5th avenue might be trump that shot you
when it 's a bit that south park did too i feel like it 's not needed but people are idiots lol
they were raised in an era where the news was held accountable literally watching the news used to be an important thing that adults needed to do to stay informed as a generation they are completely and totally unprepared for a world in which the people on the news straight up look them in the eye through their television sets and tell them things that are n't true it would be like if for us someone got a hold of our online fingerprint all our ip addresses and just straight up served us a fake internet every website we visited was suddenly a phished version of it every search engine only showed us biased sites that said ridiculous things and no matter whether er looked on our phones or our laptops every website just told us some shit like shoes were killing us we 'd eventually believe it
dude trump even claimed fraud when he won in 2016 not even winning is good enough it needs to be a historic win like when putin gets 97 % of the vote
do n’t forget that he dodged answering the question twice before giving the “ i will if it ’s fair ” answer which is the same thing he did in 2020
after being asked 2 3 times prior to answer the question
the whole goddamn framing of this election is bizarre folks acting like it ’s another “ regular ” election cycle with “ regular ” candidates the support even though it is in the minority of the entire population that the convicted felon draws is what really disappoints though
yep if “ he ” thinks it ’s fair so absurd
yeah it ’s bizarre that the question is asked to a presidential candidate because you ’d think someone that previously refused to accept the results of a presidential election and incited a coup would not be in a position to be asked the question ever again
how low has the bar been set for us to consider last night to be self restrained and composed not necessarily disagreeing just stepping back to take a look at how far we 've come
did he forget post birth abortions do n't exist as well
i think some of it was on cnn with their microphones idk how they could n’t just isolate his lapel mic instead of the podium or increase the gain on either but i ’m sure he got some b12 shots too lol
only an hour ago probably just as you were writing that comment the entire new york times editorial board posted for him to drop out
in all fairness the catastrophizing has been going on for months
i disagree that it was catastrophizing biden badly needs to allay fears about his age and capacity and there 's very little he could have done worse to address it he looked exactly the way right wing media has been trying to portray him the fact he went out and had a fiery energetic speech afterwards that will be seen by a fraction of the viewers that saw him shit the bed at the debate is beyond confusing
just check the accounts of people spamming trump shit they are all conservatives literally posting in christian subreddits dank memes conservative and libertarian subs
omg when trump said that immigrants are stealing black jobs i was so hoping that biden would come back with what exactly is a black job that was one of the many softballs thrown at biden but hopefully enough people listened and are able to notice these things themselves
cuban americans are also super triggered by the word communism
to be fair this post is based off 14 people and it 's at the top of r all so that times sienna poll probably has far more merit
i love when a headline is like “ person slammed for thing ” and the “ slamming ” is from 3 randos with like 100 followers combined
it reaffirms their beliefs it ’s why this post was so heavily upvoted and reached the very top of the front page of reddit within 3 hours that and bots people need it to be true that ’s the problem with reddit ’s upvote system headlines get upvoted not because they speak truths which can be uncomfortable truths but because people upvote what validates their worldview
the chatter i 've seen has been that younger leftists who were critical of biden before were reluctantly reminded that trump was the opposition again and that even if they hated the 2 old men arguing they finally reluctantly said they 'd support biden they hated the debate performance but they knew what 's at stake if they did n't vote this was people who claimed otherwise just a few months ago i think the reality has hit them now that trump really is going to be on the ballot and that letting him win is a massive threat to their way of life
we ai n't even bout to stress we got
the one that got me is “ scholars all over the world wanted states to have the right to abortions in there hands ” no no they did n’t and i ’m gon na be so honest i honestly do n’t think biden did a bad job it was n’t great or really a good job but i feel like i too at the ripe age of 23 going against trump i ’d be just as flabbergasted and tripping over my self making sure i do everything right because the guy literally 3 feet from me is just spouting nonsense and complete bs and there ’s nothing you can do to stop half the country from believing it i ’d actually probably have a meltdown followed by an aneurism
i think people would look at biden as their own grandfather and trump as that crazy uncle that only shows up at family reunions that everyone despises but put up with because you know it would just break mom 's heart if he was nt invited when he does show up he tags along his unruly kids his wife who does nt keep secret how much she hates him but only puts up with his shit because she knows she wo nt get jack in a divorce has no prospects or skills and makes no qualms about it when talking with the women and he just can not stop going on and on about his high school days like it matters i know i did
definitely take a look at his speech he just made earlier today in nc he had energy and looked refreshed biden was clearly under the weather and off his game yesterday and i hope we all can look at the bigger picture here edit link to speech
the dems could at least pick a vp that people like in case biden dies never heard anybody have much feelings about harris
you say that but i literally overheard two coworkers talking about the debate this morning by and one was had to explain that no one is killing healthy babies after they ’re born
they apparently just put the baby on the counter and apparently it just dies
you can be the most uninformed person on the planet and understand that murdering a baby after it ’s born is not legal in this country trump is a joke
i would n’t be so sure of that i went to a very very conservative evangelical high school and they believed that shit in the early 2000s they will believe whatever reinforces their world view no matter how batshit crazy it sounds to the rest of us
did he actually say that immigrants are taking black jobs edit lmao wow of course he did
i was waiting for that line after he said black jobs like can you elaborate sir
that 's some good stuff lol 's have n't had a good chuckle in a while
i noticed dana called him former president and called biden president then i went to bed because i could n't stomach watching that orange monster lying so much
it sounds legitimately annoying but it 's just been american precedent since the founding to continue referring to all people who have been president as president even after leaving office
and to my understanding at least is still illegal in blue states somebody correct me if i ’m wrong
just like allowing people to make plans for end of life care became death panels the lies never stop
former governor of virginia abortion who was a paediatric neurologist two days earlier on january 30 northam had made controversial comments about abortion during a wtop interview about the repeal act where he stated that if a severely deformed or otherwise non viable fetus was born after an unsuccessful abortion attempt the infant would be resuscitated if that 's what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother conservative politicians and media figures characterized northam 's comments as promoting infanticide he was speaking as a doctor and of course conservative media completely mischaracterised his statements fetuses with life threatening deformities are aborted all the time many babies die soon after birth the republicans try to paint it as all babies are healthy and all pregnancies are successful which is nonsense
we already need more of it tx infant mortality up by 12 % post heartbeat ban
i do n’t know if i got it word for word but that ’s what he said
not only did trump straight up say that but he kept repeating it too apparently that 's what folks are getting up to in virginia these days
more or less he 's referencing a from the governor ralph northam who said the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that 's what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother the last part about and then was taken by many to be that he was imply that they 'd decide to kill the child after it was born
dems are so incompetent at messaging most conservatives do n't even know that this bill was presented they need to have every congressperson going to every press outlet demanding action explanations from republicans scream that border security is important from every megaphone that you can reach just like the rs do pick out like 3 strong takeaways from the bill x billion for border security supported by a b c and incorporates the republican plan and repeat them so often that it is unavoidable question specific republicans you said yesterday that we are putting america in jeopardy so why are you stopping us from getting this funding for border security call them out when they do their immigrant scare tactics reverse it on them basically do what jon stewart did with the medical support for veterans own the news cycle do a full court press get the soundbites buttigieg is like the only democrat that knows how to do this and it is like republican playbook 101 it 's embarrassing how poorly the party uses the modern media to get their message out
he is clearly tired from all the campaigning while trump sat his fat ass in court for weeks biden has some sort of upper respiratory infection he looked like he was on cold n flu tablets whereas trump was on adderal firing up with complete lies and answers totally unrelated to the questions
because he does n't care he also nodded and smiled every time biden mentioned something shitty he did like oh yeah i remember that good times
i think this is more of a human thing than an american thing maybe not the world over but i think people are generally attracted to self assuredness because our own sense of self assuredness is in short supply
american media does n't give a shit about substance they care about style that 's why trump got so much airtime in 2016 while clinton 's detailed policy proposals got absolutely nothing
the issue is that trump supporters have been hammering away at the biden is senile thing for months now and he just looked senile in an unedited unbiased format trump is senile too of course but the angry loud kind of senility makes it harder to see that
yes biden ' i may not be a great orator but i listen to my circle of experts and we can handle the job ' trump i suck the fascist shit directly out of putins asshole im'grints libs everybody shit yer pants post debate analysis drones on and on about how bad this is for biden lol
why surprised of course there was going to be a massive astroturf spike following the debate most of what you saw was prob prewritten before the debate even happened
the press hates bidenthey love trump because he gets them good ratings
good that 's some racist shit he was spewing all evening beside the fact that legal and illegal immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than us born citizens his claims were just insane
he probably thinks white collar means white
insanity how people have n’t grabbed onto that line of thinking more he was legitimately seconds away from saying “ and then they ’re going to come for white jobs next ” it ’s unfortunate because i do n’t think enough people sat and listened to what was said last night in its entirety if you ’re still on the fence after hearing trump talk last night i do n’t know what will convince someone otherwise
he did this twice during the debate “ they ’re taking black jobs hispanic jobs and wait until what happens next ” or something along those lines
yes this was the craziest thing he said during the debate my husband looked over at me and said “ did he just fucking say what i think he just said ” but it just gets lost in the rest of the crazy shit that flies out of his mouth
everyone is ignoring the fact that the date of our withdrawal was set while trump was commander in chief as a poison pill to set up the next administration
uugh i still want someone to pushback on afghanistan it was such a shitshow because trump designed it that way all the plans were set before he left office and we could n't stay in afghanistan forever
it ’s not just those females who may become pregnant in the future who have a lot to fear from another trump term he will go full on autocratic finish destroying the environment the economy and our social safety nets and institute project 2025 every thinking american should be scared
as a woman who also ca n't get pregnant it impacts us too our doctors will stop practicing medicine which means we wo n't be able to get cancer tests treatments etc etc like yes abortion is healthcare and women of childbearing age are in the most immediate danger and it 's important to vote to keep them safe thank you and if you have women in your life who think it does n't matter to them and thus wo n't vote because they are n't able to get pregnant make sure to remind them that it impacts absolutely everyone because no one has a right to medical privacy anymore and it impacts everyone who has had a uterus because welp those parts can all get cancer and you can get endometrial cancer even after having a uterus removed
abortion is n't just a woman 's issue men especially decent men i e men who do n't abandon someone just because they got pregnant suffer from unwanted pregnancies everyone should be concerned about this stuff i 'm not saying what about the menz i 'm saying this should be treated as a mainstream issue abortion rights are human rights abortion restrictions impacts us all i worry about both my kids in their 20s one is considering sterilization over this issue i advised her not to panic and reminded her about iuds etc but i would absolutely support her choice if she wanted surgery
i woke up the day after the election and checked the results i swore that i was having a nightmare and i 'm canadian
and lower taxes for billionaires those poor billionaires
it probably can be measured it very much can and he was bragging about the meaurement that whole i got other nato countries to pay bit they started throwing money into defense because the nation that really wanted to be world police suddenly went insane and said they would nt protect anyone anymore and wanted to be the suck ass of putin it 's like bragging i got my kid to start driving because i took my hands off the wheel on the highway and they had to lunge for it to stop us dying
people do nt get to moan about supreme court decisions if they do nt vote for biden and trump wins simple as that
do look into it and spread word to your friends and family they 're already starting it just today the supreme court overturned chevron essentially giving all regulatory power to federal judges from now on anyone can sue over a regulation and a federal judge can overturn it this could mean less restrictions on pollutants less restrictions on airplane safety less restrictions on guns less restrictions on food safety absolutely disastrous ruling the only way to combat this now is to have congress pass laws with extremely specific wording on what gets regulated even then a judge could overturn it and boy did trump stack the lower courts with maga judges
john oliver talks about it in this video if you like his humor or you can read this breakdown
just look at infant mortality rates in texas after effectively banning abortion it has risen 8 % in less than 2 years since roe was overturned
not sure if it 's bots or trolls huge uptick in anti biden comments since last night
they grew up during the era of the fairness doctrine it definitely was n't perfect but it did not allow the complete fabrication of reality that happens nowadays our generation that grew up with the internet learned that 100 % of the people online are only interested in scamming and or molesting us we have some antibodies in being a bit skeptical in the media we consume
he claimed fraud during the republican primaries before he was elected lol he has claimed fraud in every election he 's participated in
and even then saying as long as it is a free and fair election is peak trumpian we all know that means if i lose it was n't free and fair and i fucking hate when conservatives tell me he say he would accept it and i am twisting his words conservatives really do think we can not see through their double speak
the rise of donald trump has practically guaranteed that dark times will continue for decades and for many that is the rest of time there are only two ways out 1 repeated landslides against republicans until they moderate or 2 a crash like we have not seen here since the civil war
definitely but the cult was always going to stick to their mango messiah they 're too far gone but the fact that the media is treating him as anything other than the clear and present danger he is is fucking tragic though when you realize they 're overwhelmingly run by rich people who like republican economic policies make the rich richer fuck the poor and that rage clicks generate more revenue it all makes sense i just hope that we can pull this off and that it somehow is the beginning of a shift in how the nation handles things people have got to see what 's going on we ca n't keep going like this then again maybe it 's time for america as we know it to come to an end but that 's a terrifying prospect
where was this guy yesterday
yo what the actual fuck happened last night how is this the same guy he is at least twice as lucid and 10x more coherent
where the fuck was this energy last night he would have destroyed trump wtf joe either way it ’s good to know he still has it last night i was worried he would even make it to november
jesus those youtube comments sometimes i forget that half of the people living in this country are conspiratorial morons
what in the actual fuck this makes last night performance at the debate even more bizarre he looks ok in this video
yeah but that s the effect of gish galloping and falling for it when trump throws out 12 outlandish remarks in his 90 seconds and you have 90 seconds respond to what he said plus answer your question that would be difficult even if you were nt 80 with a stutter which is something that typically worsens the quicker you speak or get flustered
seriously i kept wondering “ is nobody gon na ask about that ” lol so weird
mostly this my cuban family supports that nutter butter orange troll and it ’s all out of fear of communism makes me sick
this is it right here
i mean the post could be based off 2 people and it would still be this upvoted people upvote based on the headline not the actual content
consumers are mad tweet with 1 like and it 's a porn bot
yeah this sub is almost unusable now nothing but clickbait sensationalist articles from newsweek tnr slate etc
bruh for someone as sociopathicly dishonest as donald my jaw dropped when he pushed the idea that everyone from both sides wanted the decision of abortion handed to the states like does literally anyone believe that why the fuck would roe be such a dividing topic if everyone agreed
yeah acting like overturning roe vs wade was universally thought of as the right thing to do was a bridge too far even for trump
if the 2nd debate happens i fully expect biden to go with something similar to everything that man says is a lie here 's the facts and just ignore whatever trump said whatever trump says ignore the specifics an paint it with a broad stroke that its lies and garbage and not worth listening to or remembering
honestly he sounded tired he had probably been up since 6 am and they had the debate so damn late meanwhile trump took a nap on the plane did two rails of addies off of a stewardesses tits and was ready to go loved the part about illegals killing and raping 100 000 people
yup biden struggled because he actually attempted to make a coherent point and not spout off the first thing that came to his mind trump has never been burdened by the truth
biden needed to reduce the policy and statistic talk a bit stay angry lower himself just a bit to trump 's level and stay in the moment biden 's strongest moments were when he was angry and responding directly to trump like when he talked about veterans his weakest moments were when he tried to cram 20 minutes of policy discussion into a 2 minute response because he 'd struggle to find the correct words in time and stutter he also needs an audience his campaign thought the lack of audience and muted mics would hurt trump more than biden but they miscalculated greatly biden thrives on crowd energy and muting trump just made him seem more reasonable because he could n't lash out like a child constantly biden gave a speech at a campaign event directly after the debate and he was louder more energized and stuttered less he gave another speech today and said he knows he does n't walk talk or debate like he used to but he knows how to tell the truth that 's the biden we needed last night his campaign 's best bet would be to schedule a second and final debate as close to the election as possible to give people time to forget his performance in this debate and for the spin to do its job it 'll then be up to him to crush it in the final debate to leave a good impression in undecided voters ' minds just before they head to the polls
it ’s impossible to debate a sociopath it ’s impossible to moderate a sociopath if we ’re saying biden ’s too old what ’s jake tapper ’s excuse when your opponent is n’t beholden to truth logic or reality debating is just pointless
it 's really difficult to debate with someone who does n't care what anybody asks or challenges does n't care what 's true or not true just says whatever he thinks will get the audience on his side i have worked with people like that they are n't technically lying because they do n't have the concept that something might be true and something might be false only ' what narrative is to my advantage '
so many of these conservative states will not allow the people to vote on abortion rights because they know they would pass trump just kept lying that now the people get to decide i wish biden had mentioned that those states refuse to allow it
i would have ripped him like a stand up comic working the crowd i would be merciless ladies and gentlemen trump just shit his pants on live tv you 're gon na have to take my word for it since you ca n't smell through the tv but i 'm standing next to him and it smells like a mix of pond scum vomit and the mcdonald 's dollar menu
y’know grandpa has good things to say every now and then uncle gets into fights and makes everybody uncomfortable at thanksgiving
sure but will they want their own grandfather running the show or their crazy uncle that ’s the delimma and the fact it ’s questionable is the scary part
exactly biden all horse from a cold they said how much antihistamine and cold medicine did he take just to make it to the stage that throws me off my game and i 'm 63
looking at the bigger picture requires an element of intelligence which i think still maintains critical mass in the u s if not we are doomed
wow that ’s like night and day maybe having these debates late at night is a mistake
she was very popular among southern black voters they were super quiet about it but i did n't meet a single one who liked trump they loved kamala
nobody is killing unhealthy babies after they 're born either that idea and the ' you never fired anyone even after afghanistan ' were so easy to rebut and make trump look stupid how 's this the afghanistan withdrawal was like most things a very complicated affair you knew this before your security clearance was revoked was it perfect no am i happy with everything that happened no but if you fire every employee who makes a mistake then you end up with people afraid to do anything that 's how you end up bankrupting two casinos along with all your failed businesses did i do ok
that line is emblematic of why biden struggles in these debates the way you debate trump is just ask him to explain wtf he just said all biden had to do in response is ask umm what exactly is a black job and then let trump jump on that rake but giving your opponent more time to speak is anathema to the last 50 years of debate logic
yeah this is a non issue it 's just normal protocol they 'd use the same title for a former president of a different country as well
it is also my understanding that murder is in fact illegal
quite legal in red states though see e g stand your ground laws
i forgot about the death panels i think about some kid lying awake at night in some red state having heard all about it and no explanation all worried that obama was going to deem his grandma too old or too sick for care and have her deathed
it was really fucking close something that atrocious should not be allowed to be said full stop
he said it easily three or four times the former governor of virginia said they would take the babies after they were born and they were going to put them aside and decide what to do with them later ' it was one of his mantras next to millions of them are coming up across the border and they 're coming out of prisons and they 're coming out of mental institutions and they 're killing everybody it was like a playlist of his worst hits on repeat
and to add the context for those too lazy to click the link he was talking about babies that were delivered with severe defects that were ultimately not going to survive it 's more of a pulling the plug discussion no one is killing healthy babies that is infanticide and as every fact checking website ever has pointed out is absolutely illegal in every state
trump ’s a buffoon there ’s no doubt about that but biden rambled lost his train of thought several times and just looks too old and feeble to take on the hardest job in the world i ’ll still vote for him because he ’s not trump but it ’s a pretty sorry state of affairs when we have to choose one of these two men
also cnn has historically been a leftwing news but was recently boughout by a rightwing billionaire now they are essentially tim pool pretending to be leftwing
american media does n't give a shit about substance they care about style they enable narcissists narcissism is the language capitalists and authoritarians speak fluently and the currency whose value they innately understand
and magas idea of winning the debate is trump hurling a bunch of personal attacks and lying through his teeth the entire time basically being an asshole which is exactly why they like him so much the people who were watching the debate to get a sense of where each party was aligned found out that trump is the same narcissistic jerk he ’s always been and joe is old but honest
definitely helps with the white supremacist vote tho
his claims were just insane i mean he is a felon
all forms of crime with violent being the biggest discrepancy as in they do less violent crime in the us than anyone by a larger margin
that 's certainly the way he 'd like it to be
blue collar jobs for smurfs only
but it just gets lost in the rest of the crazy shit that flies out of his mouth just like when he was president it was a constant deluge of diarrhea from his mouth that absolutely made it hard to just focus on one insane thing because it was all insane
my jaw dropped in the same exact way biden 's did when that came out of trump 's mouth it was unfuckingbeleivable yes he admitted to being a traitor on the global stage while there are so many people suffering in the ukraine even the russian soldiers they 're suffering too and trump fucking brags about that shit what a soulless weasel
i do n't know how you can parse that
we 're also ignoring the fact that russia invaded ukraine in 2014
well interesting enough the horrible chevron decision made today will make it so trump has far less unchecked power the conservative courts will ultimately be likely to rule in his favor but those interested in retaining democracy might be able to delay the worst of his goals 4 years not saying i want to find out and the decision is a very bad one in the long run but it could be temporarily beneficial should trump end up winning vomit
to add to what you 're saying it 'll be more than just the pool of doctors drying up there is a lot of medical research related to fertility hormone treatments etc that will be on the block and researchers and companies alike will shy away from touching four years of the gop burning the place down plus whatever comes after that as they cement power is going to be an absolute travesty for women of all ages
husbands and boyfriends are also affected when something goes wrong in a pregnancy imagine having to consider the loss of your wife girlfriend because she needs an abortion but ca n’t easily get one they either have to go to a different state in some cases or like in texas wait until she ’s on the brink of death before a doctor is allowed to act people who claim to be pro life do n’t think about parents who wanted a baby and then sit on the floor crying with each other because something went wrong these people had nurseries decorated names picked out and in their minds imagined a whole new life hopes and dreams are shattered abortion is healthcare and it is necessary to have access to all
i flew to denver on that 2016 election day hilary was winning pretty comfortably when we took off trump was in the lead when we landed i am still not totally convinced that our plane did nt fly through some kind of wormhole into this hellscape reality
boeing ceo dreamt of this day
yup it used to be that is a fetus was unviable the parents would often elect to have an abortion now they ca n't make that choice and have to go through birth for a child that wo n't live very long
it ’s literal psy ops they ’re all 1 week old accounts too lol
the consequences of trump putting three justices on the supreme court will fuck this country for at least a generation
it is time for america as we know it to come to an end but not by imploding into a fascistic hell hole it ’s time to show we can step up to the plate and choose to pursue our better nature to realize the promises of an idolized democracy many of us carry in our heads about this country it is never too late
he was asleep biden is in his mid 80s if you think 9 00 p m is when he wants to start a debate you are incorrect you are seeing him when the sun is out and he has had a good night 's rest i 'm not even 40 and i get tired by 9 00 p m
people are saying he was sick hoarse voice noticeable cough aloof etc
might have been on meds for his cold he still has a cough during this speech
he was fucking sick last night seriously the worst possible time he could 've been sick edit have republicans accused it of being a deepfake yet also holy shit youtube 's comments are infected with magats and probably russian commenters
but also how do you even debate someone who lies about everything and refuses to answer questions
why is the background blurry its ai jfc
keep in mind a lot of those commenters are n’t americans but russians
look his cold went away yes that is how colds work and even if i did n't think it was a cold am i supposed to believe that he took performance enhancing drugs for the speech in the video but not for the debate like what even is the implication supposed to be
and the crazy part is trump just decided to not answer some of his questions so he could double down on previous questions and no one called him out for that
especially when the actual content shows hispanic s upport is now essentially even between the two candidates in carried out by the new york times and the siena college research institute 45 percent of hispanic people said they would vote for biden and 44 percent said trump
oh yea the second i heard it i paused it and watched yt on my phone took a 5 min break it ’s so infuriating i remember as a kid mitt romney lost the entire campaign or election or whatever because he left his dog in his crate strapped to the roof of a moving vehicle al gore got backlash for checks notes accidentally sighing audibly cause he was tired during his and bushes debate
it 's only been refuted by literally every election where it 's been on the ballot
also the part about democrats killing babies after they are born like no just no that is not a thing that happens this debate should have had real time fact checking and it was terrible that it did n't
how about his claim that democrats support abortions “ after birth ”
the only problem with that is as others pointed out trump is too confident look at the debate transcript looks like biden won on paper gave actual responses to questions yet the audio version sounds like trump edged out and won because simply he is louder and is n’t stumbling over words and this is just relegated to biden v trump but this is an overall example of how the right are just more vocal
i do n't think facts will somehow work against people who are already ignoring facts better response might be to just feed and encourage trump 's ego and let him bury himself as his lies get more extreme i think even people who follow him will at some point have to realize how ridiculous it 's getting even if it 's just a small percentage of his voters someone else mentioned the mitt romney please continue governor moment but i do n't think trump would be smart enough to catch those moments biden 's entire debate could just be repeating and reinforcing the points where trump does n't realize he 's alienating his own voters trump has already given plenty of ammo against himself via his twitter and whatnot so biden just needs to bring up any of that and let trump go full alex jones no doubt trump will find plenty of ways to contradict and bury himself
loved the part about illegals killing and raping 100 000 people or the part about doctors and a former governor of virginia what literally taking newborn babies and murdering them in a late term abortion in reality late term abortions are insanely rare and really only occur when the life of the mother or fetus is at stake like if there 's a severe abnormality or deformity that will result in the imminent death of the fetus shortly after birth they 're heartbreaking decisions that traumatize hopeful parents and rob joy from entire families trump 's mischaracterizations of such horrible but medically necessary events is disgusting and will only result in untold suffering and the deaths of new mothers
even if you try to be moderate idk if this is cope or not but i swear trump was on adderall his pupils were dilated and he was definitely acting a whole lot different
i believe he has a cold which is n't a great excuse but he got up there and did it for better or worse whatever happened it needs to not happen again otoh donny man boobs lied more than he ever has and the moderators stuck to the rules yippee thanks guys they did keep trying to make tubby actually answer the f ing question they had asked but farty mcbronzer did n't even pretend to try to answer the questions i wish biden had taken care to mention that trump cheats at golf
i just saw a video on abcnews of biden at a rally in raleigh the cold thing seems to be true since he was coughing and maybe that explains medicine head slowness i 'm half his age and i do n't think clearly on sudafed and mucinex in that video joe is so fired up like where the hell was that guy the night before
i 'm pretty sure trump is on addy ca nt believe he was n't drug tested by his po its something at 53 years old i have never heard of a convicted felon getting out of a pee test
and the man has a stutter and stutters pop up when you 're frustrated
would they want their grandpa biden who has their high powered career woman aunt harris helping him find a good lawyer to make a fair will or the crazy uncle sorry great uncle lest we forget he is only 4 years younger that has surrounded himself with the frat boy cousins trying to convince him to invest in crypto
i took allergy meds and slept for three hours today i ’m 34
i 'm decades younger than biden and just got absolutely wrecked by a summer cold myself
when did he get to atlanta street closures started late wednesday so he might have stayed overnight here our air has been terrible the past few days thankfully the rain helped yesterday but tons of us did n't sleep well wednesday night either
yeah idk what the plan was having this run till 11pm in dc time that is terrible even i would have trouble maintaining a solid performance at those times without some drugs which trump is definitely not opposed to using but i 'm sure biden is very against
it ’s harder to figure it out of the cuff and 80 years old but does n’t mean he is mentally unfit for office he ’s doing a great job working for the ppl i initially overreacted too from the debate and then i watched the nc speech today and realised i ’m not voting for a masterdebater i ’m voting for someone i trust to lead the country and do the right thing
i so wish biden would have used his next two minutes to ask what a “ black and hispanic job ” is
that baby had the potential to pick up his googoogat and shoot me with it
no one is killing healthy babies no one is killing babies period even in cases where an infant is born with a condition incompatible with life the discussion gov northam references is about how the parents want to balance life extending vs palliative care newborns with terminal conditions get the same quality of treatment under the same legal and ethical guidelines as any other child with a terminal condition
what no they were never leftwing news they were always center at best and now they 're center right pretending to be center msnbc pretends to be center left but they 're not there either there is no large left wing news outlet in the us
was that voting bloc ever in question
people really think that immigrants fearing deportation would go out and commit crimes
he also said at the debate that he threatened to pull out of nato and that he was a genius for doing it because he demanded other countries put more money in to keep him from leaving nato that is a psychopath literally threatening our allies that america would no longer be a force for good if he ’s not happy
remember when trump adamantly defended vlad saying he would never ever ever go into ukraine and the reporter i think it was george stephanopoulos had to break it to him that vlad already had forces in crimea then trump tried to blame the 2014 annexation on president obama trump is soooo damned tedious and petty and dangerous af
you got ta run the reverse route exactly the same if we have any hope of restoring the timeline
maybe the real world ended in 2012 and the maya were right whatever we ’re stuck in now is some kind of malfunctioning simulation or something
it 's so painfully obvious and i 'm fucking sick of it
with large enough majorities the democrats could rightfully impeach and remove thomas and alito for e g bribes all you need is one true landslide election
and the effect on the environment will be irreparable
yeah before the debate even started i thought 9 00 pm was super late for these geezers they should have done 5 00 pm at the latest
fuck i 'm 45 and in ok shape and i 'm wiped by 9 pm
seriously i m decades younger than him and my bedtime is 9 30 p m i had no idea the debate would be so late i kept looking for it on youtube and i did n't even see it until like 9 00 i 'm like what when they aired a commercial i finally said screw it and turned it off and went to bed and this guy kept going imagine the traveling and everything else he had to do that day too i just wish he had some damn water and was allowed to be human enough to like clear his throat but no some crazy people out there would consider that some sort of weakness
note to america 's enemies if you want to start some shit begin after 9 pm est
also he 's been dealing with a cold for the last few days and probably did n't realize how far he was pushing his voice in the event before the debate
i mean if sleep was an issue why not just make him sleep a bit before the debate btw he ’s 81 i ’m not sure that qualifies as mid 80s quite yet lol
if i had to guess i ’d say he was feeling under the weather and all that debate prep fucked with his head when he is just speaking as a human he does n’t have issues he was trying to remember all that shit they wanted him to do and say and he was tired and feeling lousy and it did n’t go too well
i know i just feel sick myself that all they had to do was get this version of biden one mere good night 's rest later on stage last night and all of today 's news cycle would be vastly different
the concept of focal length is incomprehensible to these morons
man a lot of people say this and i know it ’s true for reddit and youtube but 74 m people still voted for trump in 2020 a fuckton of people support him and that ’s scary i say this because we should n’t just attribute everything to bots we should keep reality in mind too many people support this felon
that it ’s ai it ’s really that stupid
president trump here 's a question about climate change trump those damn mexicans and venezuelans are killing and raping millions of women every day
howard dean ’s campaign ended because he yelled too enthusiastically out of pitch he became unelectable ’
do n't forget some of romney 's greatest hits like ' binders full of women ' and feat obama ' please proceed governor '
romney lost the entire campaign or election or whatever because he left his dog in his crate strapped to the roof of a moving vehicle he also as part of the benghazi smear campaign just a couple of months before the election too people might have noticed how dirty that was and do n't forget him
and republican states are busy doing everything they can to toss any and all ballot initiatives that affirm abortion rights so talking like it 's going back to the people of individual states to decide is clearly nonsense and republicans are busy trying to find a way to do fetal personhood whether through passing a new federal law or just finding some legal case to get their 6 scotus judges to legislate from the bench
it ’s like the stupid bastard thinks he can speak it into existence
and you see how he immediately dismissed the actions in ks and oh where they soundly supported reasonable abortion standards a full no abortions ever plan is going to happen under trump with the full support of the evangelicals because they are now his base
the part about democrats killing babies after they are born and yet many republicans believe this to be true
it 's astonishing that biden could n't do a better job of refuting that repeat back his lies say that american voters do not want a liar in office and tell cnn to do their jobs and fact check that claim
yeah that shit is some bologna that only the deeply indoctrinated do n't find phony
this was the first time in years that trump has sounded coherent while spouting obvious lies i was genuinely shocked i take solace in the fact that his comedown today had to have been biblically painful
look at the debate transcript looks like biden won on paper gave actual responses to questions yet the audio version sounds like trump edged out and won because simply he is louder and is n’t stumbling over words and this is just relegated to biden v trump but this is an overall example of how the right are just more vocal yea yesterday among the bot spam and conservative regulars there were a lot of posts from people who seemed undecided after 4 years of a trump administration and 4 years of a biden administration and were seriously putting it up to a 90 minute debate to decide who to vote for and then they got all demoralized and sounded like they were going to vote for trump because he sounded better i heard a lot of that sort of defeatism in the last 4 years the well it seems the democrats are n't doing anything might as well vote republican sure they 'll burn the house down but at least they do what they say they 're gon na do mindset like they think they 're rooting for a sports team and need to join the winning side lol seriously though for anyone aware of what has happened during trump 's administration and what has happened during biden 's administration as far as i 'm concerned joe biden could have just answered every single prompt with deez nuts and he 'd still be a solid winner in my book lol
not even just late term he said democrats are having abortions after the birth lmao like what the fuck dude what where who man they could wheel biden out in a fuckin hospital bed with a fuckin iv bag and i 'd still vote for him in a heartbeat if the republicans had put up anyone else anyone under 60 biden 's age and performance last night would legitimately give me pause i would question my vote in a more serious manner than i ever have i am aging i get it but if it 's him vs the dipshit who wants to dismantle every american institution and rule as king dickhead forever who clearly hates the first amendment the military and the law the most violent sore loser in history it 's no question at all for me edit i 'm in a state where before 2020 i never thought my vote really mattered at all it does matter it matters more than you think please vote
this is what i ’ve been saying for years there are developments that happen late stage in pregnancy that ca n’t be predicted by previous medical tests they are heart breaking defects that no amount of surgery or medical care can overcome the women who have to have those procedures are participating in an act of mercy to spare their children a very short life filled with nothing but pain and suffering the fact that politicians are so okay with taking the most private traumatizing moments of peoples lives and using them as talking points to further their agenda is disgusting and abhorrent
anyone who has ever needed a late term abortion wanted that baby most unwanted pregnancies are aborted before the first trimester my wife and i had to make the hardest decision of our life at the end of the the second trimester when we found out a very much wanted and planned pregnancy went off the rails with a terrible genetic abnormally i would n’t wish it on my worst enemy i ’m glad we lived in a country at the time that allowed for abortion having my wife go through with the pregnancy only to have the baby stillborn or die in her arms within the hour after screaming in confusion and pain that would have been worse
this has been my argument for a while nobody who gets a late term abortion wants to they have to they want their baby but circumstances which endanger their lives force their hand
the teeth grinding and clenching jaw stuff is an obvious sign of heavy stimulant upper use you see it with speed cocaine and mdma abuse he trump absolutely needs some sort of upper to function but last night he seemed geeked out on speed
that 's called projection for you if the republicans are still pushing the sleepy joe narrative and saying that biden was going to be using energy drinks and or drugs to do well you know it 's because they are doing it first
i thought he was on something
pakman talking with dr john kruse about trump 's possible adhd and prolonged stimulant use
yeah he was amped up like i took 20 mg of non xr that shit makes me jittery and i used to take 10 mg until i switched to a non stimulant version
i saw it plain as day he sniffs a lot
the right media has been telling us this for a while
he sounded a lot better today
also anyone that much thought into things should also be aware that biden is actually good at the job
trump insinuating biden would use drugs made me think trump was definitely using drugs
add while also having only 1 to 2 minutes at a time to formulate and articulate meaningful and substantive responses to policy questions while your opponent just spews lies and hate instead onto the list of difficulties i hate our modern presidential debate format it 's so fucking stupid
it 's possible to believe that joe biden is mentally unfit for office but also that donald trump is even more mentally unfit along with a litany of other things that make him unfit i 'll be voting for joe biden but i 'm praying for father time
i do n’t care if he ’s just a figurehead that hires competent people trump is volatile and self serving he chose not to articulate any benefit for the american people to vote for him biden did n’t look so hot but he detailed plans for the future and clearly loves his country trump only has vitriol and will hire people with the same hate for america my vote is for biden
it ’s not surprising there were a lot of yahoos with axes to grind where were and still are coming out of the woodwork to sew dissent after they go away i assume the consensus will be that biden did okay but not stellar and we witness an almost unbroken string of lies from trump
i think biden was stunned by the audacity of his remarks and how to gracefully cover not only that bullshit but the debate topic summing up any part and trying to connect it to what trump was talking about he would have to leave some very choice remarks and there is no guarantee trump would figure out what they meant without even more of them getting the point across the moderators felt like fastfood cashiers trying to take orders from two customers who ca n't stop arguing with trump showing no respect to the venue while changing the topic and repeatedly painting a narrative to make the country and himself look like victims of biden in some demented fantasy of misconstrued data sets and random factoids in an uncouth whining bark that was uninterrupted between debate topics
good point maybe the plane crashed and i am in some kind of lost pergatory thing or something
my first thought hearing him wow dude 's got a cold and 9 pm is his bed time like my 80 year old father who gets up and wanders the house at 3 am
i 'm 33 working an active 7 3 30 job 5 days a week and i still check out before 10 on most saturdays life is fucking exhausting and i do n't run one of the most powerful nations on earth
yep all of america will just stand around and do nothing unless they hear directly from the president this plan ca n't fail
someone mentioned he was doing a meet and greet or something before the debate
howard dean ’s campaign ended because he yelled too enthusiastically out of pitc dean was already dropping in the polls by the time of the scream in fact he made that speech in response to coming in third in iowa dean himself said things were looking bad 3 weeks beforehand the dean scream came to be seen as the unofficial end of his campaign but dean said the worst moment was three weeks earlier when he realized his momentum was slipping away i was going to rallies and i began to realize the same people are following me around he said i felt like phish or the dead i do n't blame the scream speech i do n't blame anyone but me i was from a small state i did n't have the national experience dean went on but then again if i had been as experienced at a national level i would n't have been as exciting a candidate what is nuts is that the gop successfully smeared john kerry for being a literal war hero
and we ’re gon na take washington d c and the white house hyaeerrr
right dude turned into a meme because he got excited
kinda miss those days now trump would have been dead right out of the gate back then
my 3 all time “ holy shit ” moments while watching live tv 1 guy wins who wants to be a millionaire while calling his dad to tell him he was going to win 2 please proceed governor 3 dan ’s funeral
feat obama ' please proceed governor ' with all the depressing as shit political news thank you for reminding me of that gem lol
i always loved obama 's reply to romney during the debates when romney said we had fewer ships in the navy and obama pointed out that romney needed to look at the structure of our military because we also had fewer bayonets and horses
only fools believed the whole let the states decide rhetoric the goal is and has always been draconian national restrictions on a woman 's independence and self determination
he does literally not “ i said literally but meant figuratively ” he literally thinks like a child that if he lies hard enough it will become true before anyone can fact check
yep that ’s called infanticide and given that conservative grifters like to call all abortions infanticide that ’s a real phenomenon in itself
i know right where does this shit come from oh right trumps mouth
yup accuse the opposition of doing what you are already doing so when you get caught it looks like but both sides
we have to go back coincidentally i ’m in the middle of a rewatch of lost i ’m in season six still such a fantastic series
what if hell does exist and we just happen to be living in it right now
if that ’s true whoever on his team thought that was a good idea should get fired
gop successfully smeared john kerry for being a literal war hero remember when trump called dead soldiers suckers and losers for doing something without a clear tangible benefit to them
i ’ve never seen that quote but it actually makes him more like able the zinger at the end is great but that comparison to phish and grateful dead was just spot on lol
yep that ’s called infanticide no abortion means stopping a pregnancy after a birth there is no pregnancy therefore there is no such thing as abortion after birth even if someone did commit infanticide it would in no way be related to abortion repugs are counting on ignorant uneducated masses to have no idea what abortion means and deliberately fill their heads with nonsensical myths about abortion meaning slicing off limbs and making fetuses and born babies bleed to death that way they manipulate said uneducated masses into being stridently opposed to any abortions since they have been brainwashed to believe it involves slicing off limbs and bleeding it is seriously no surprise that repugs are vehemently against education
for days the right wing media and members of congress had been incessantly lying about me and my new job as executive director of the disinformation governance board they falsely claimed that the board set up to coordinate policy related to disinformation within the department of homeland security was actually set up to police americans ’ views and that i would be the country ’s chief censor so her job was to help find and stop disinformation in dhs and republicans sued to stop it yet again proving republicans like disinformation
the right is the epitome of ironic naming
america has made women lesser than men with the removal of roe rape pregnancies are everywhere especially in red states i ’m disgusted living here with republicans
just like jesus would have done
super weird how it 's always democrats getting all the death threats wonder why that is
i have no idea because the biggest thing of concern in the entire world is apparently biden had one bad performance that seems to be more important to everyone
eli5 how is this not slander and or libel particularly from sworn congresspeople who i assume are speaking on the record
conservatives want a change legalize rape
as can recently be seen in the hearings where they interviewed fauci the chairman opened with a monologue which he described “ unpopular opinions were silenced during covid ” was referring to the fact that they pushed dangerous remedies and fake studies where “ masks take away oxygen and they do n’t protect you ” and i ’m sure there were a few racial slurs in there that were also blocked on twitter disinformation different opinions to them
we should put a task force or something together to take a look into that
spreading disinformation through faux news facebook etc is the main reason why over the past few decades support for fascism has grown to the point where it now threatens to get voted into power elon musk and his secret financial backers did n't buy twitter to make money they bought it to take control
i mean it ’s a lot harder to see their bullshit in a larger pile of bullshit
rape pregnancies are everywhere do you have a stat for that
literally me talking to my venezuelan bf who watched the debate with his family and said trump and fascism is the only good choice for the us but graduated in us politics honors in an expensive university in us
they also silenced respected epidemiologists who disagreed on a matter of science on the origin of covid since they said it came from a lab which it did fauci coordinated with twitter to ban their accounts
yeah one that can enforce wait
it 's estimated 64000 rape related pregnancies happened in states that banned abortion regardless of rape and incest keep in mind rape is often under reported as well so there may be more rape pregnancies than we have stats for
“ they estimate in a research letter published wednesday in jama internal medicine that 64 565 pregnancies have been caused by rape in the 14 states where abortion is banned ”
i do n't know if that says more about him or about you for dating him
that ’s terrible but i also do n’t believe in exceptions for rape for abortions those rape numbers are horrifying but ultimately disconnected from my thoughts on abortion
right i ca n't imagine keeping a relationship going with a fascist
you believe that rape victims should be forced to carry the progeny of their rapists to term i do n't really know how to describe that view other than monstrous
they do tend to be snappy dressers
yes murdering a child for how it was procreated is also monstrous to me
life is life how it was procreated does n’t mean life deserves to die
i think that the life of the child is important two evils do n’t make a right
wow these comments got cruel fast without any ask for explanation
a child has been born an abortion is n't murder bc no birth has occurred terminating a pregnancy is n't the same thing as killing an infant
yes murdering a child for how it was procreated is also monstrous to me if i was going to be born as the child of my mother and my mother 's rapist and my mother did n't want me but legally was n't allowed to abort i think i 'd rather have been aborted than live that life
personally if my almost certainly religiously grounded definition of child extended to lumps of a few cells and as a result thousands of innocent crime victims at least some of whom did n't share my religious views were going to suffer months of physical torture as well as serious and potentially lifelong mental trauma i would find it difficult to get out of bed in the morning and while lying in bed i would probably also rethink my definition of what constitutes a child but hey you do you
your beliefs on what life is and what lives are important should dictate whether a woman carries the child of her rapist to term
i ’d say if you ’ve not grown up as an unwanted child you have no idea how evil it can be to wish that existence on someone else
i am fairly confident that anyone who would n't immediately make that their ex boyfriend is someone that deserves a little shit talking
see that ’s where we just do n’t see eye to eye and have an irrevocable difference on
all lives are important yes life is sacred and should n’t be destroyed if it does n’t have to be
“ man this two year old is unwanted i guess we just kill it then because it ’s bad to be unwanted ”
why are all lives important
life is fundamentally life i do n’t think we should kill a fetus the same way i do n’t think we should use the death penalty for convicted felons of heinous crimes
republicans know they can not win with their ideas instead they seek to “ win ” by stripping folks of their ability to legally and rightfully vote
know what ’s coming check your voter registration status often
some dare call it fascism
kemp deleted both me and my husband once and now we check our registration regularly
according to scotus there should be a jury trial for every voter they want to remove
when a party treats voters as a threat they 're not planning to help the voters
they ca n’t win unless they cheat
magats want elections like in russia where yes technically they are elections but somehow trump always wins
they believe that black people are not the people and should never have their votes counted
or and hear me out here they want voter rolls to be correct so that only those legally entitled to vote can do so wild concept i know but for some reason democrats are staunchly opposed to the idea of closing any possible weak point that would allow election interference
whereas democrats attempt to jail their opposition and use never ending lawfare to water down election integrity and security democrats literally claim that requiring people to prove that they are who they say they are and that they therefore have a legal right to vote by insisting on things like voter i'd or signature verification etc is an attempt to rig elections and use lawfare to change election laws to ensure any form voter i 'd or validation is removed democrats claim election audits to verify votes are an attempt to rig elections it 's utterly baffling
do n't even get me started on kemp his whole dems hacked us the weekend before the 2018 election was maddening
kemp is a shambles i do n't know if he is corrupt or just extremely incompetent
that 's okay the new scotus will just rule that 's unconstitutional
or and hear me out here they want voter rolls to be correct so that only those legally entitled to vote can do so
i mean you 'd have to be utterly brain dead to believe that republicans ever have good intentions at this point it 's just basic logic to understand this
sounds good enough on paper until you actually look at the actual initiative to remove people from the voter registration rolls and find that nowhere is this particular legislation is an actionable item to achieve that goal alone it ’s pretty fucking obvious the goal is to remove targeted out groups and gerrymander in order to give the in groups a greater say tsk tsk not very democratic that move to target and remove and i thought this was america
removing people 's ability to vote is the actual election interference all of these laws masquerading as election security are just ways that on their face seem plausible but together with everything else equal reducing voting power if it were this alone i could see your point you do n't have to listen to me though a whole list from the aclu
they can clean up voter rolls with existing laws and procedures the only reason to remove voters without notifying them or going through a legal process is so they 're surprised they ca n't vote on election there is not widespread voter fraud the gop has gop officials running elections in a lot of counties and states has election observers at polling locations and has months to challenge election results if they find irregularities they 've never found election fraud on a scale that would turn the outcome of an election in fact each election there 's more fraudulent votes cast by republicans than democrats this is not about fixing a non existent fraud problem as trying to reduce voter turnout by preventing people from voting
you seriously ca n’t believe republicans are going to just follow the law they themselves put in place what if conservatives remove people by error ’ and then say “ well we did n’t catch it in time ” it ’s a bs excuse to remove votes
yea we really hate it when hugo chavez gets involved in our elections do you have any other lies to tell today
got downvoted to hell once and back for more with even more outlandish bullshit eh remember a clear attempt at voter suppression to make anyone unsure of their legal status to vote to stay home so who jails their opposition downvoted guy
because the laws are n't about election security they 're about reducing voter turnout i linked an article from the alcu below here it is again
attempt to jail trump is going to jail steve bannon is going to jail all because a jury found them guilty remember when you love states rights well states have the right to prosecute people
the conservative heritage foundation has been keeping track of voter fraud since the early 80s they 've found 1 513 instances in all that time in 40 years that 's around 38 cases per year less than one case of voter fraud per state per year
this is the most disingenuous argument and you know it if you mean jail trump it is because he committed serious crimes democrats do n’t like him because his is a criminal did you see democrats trying to do this to romney no because while democrats certainly do n’t agree with him he is n’t a criminal
i did n't read anything dishonest in that article about republicans they challenged someone 's right to vote as the person 's address was a business address not residential and he even says in the article he no longer lives sleeps at the premises so when he responds to the challenge he will give his correct home address making his registration correct essentially exactly the same for every single one quoted as having their registration challenged and it also points out 1000 's of challenged were removed as the registrations challenged did not verify their right to be able to vote is it inconvenient yes but voting is a privilege and you should ensure that your voter record is correct as it also means any attempt to inject illegal votes becomes more difficult or if someone votes illegally it will be more obvious
you ca n’t use logic to talk an idiot out of a position they did n’t use logic to believe in the first place
never have a i heard any republican say they want to correct voter rolls to remove any specific group of people from being able to vote you will never see such a comment on any republican forum or chat group all you will ever see is republicans stating they believe that voter rolls need to be accurate to ensure election integrity as if they are incorrect people could vote illegally i would challenge anyone here to provide me any proof of a republican saying cleaning voter rolls has to do with removing any specific type of or group of voters
the npr article is infuriating because unfortunately i agree that it seems a deliberate attempt to limit black voters ability to vote while i do n't think it 's about racism i suspect in that case it 's because they know believe the majority of black voters will vote for dems so want to limit the votes which is racist but not racist as it 's not that they do n't like black people they just do n't like that they vote blue everyone 's vote matters it does n't matter who you vote for i actually favour making it a legal requirement to vote with failure to do so resulting in a penalty such as a fine that being said in some of the recent elections blue areas seemed to do exactly the same where although there were voting stations the machines were not working properly meaning gop voters struggled to vote and as everyone knows gop primarily vote in person neither side is honest and both sides try gerrymander and fix things as to early voting i actually do n't like early voting i think it opens the door to allow election interference given the shambles of the recent elections where chain of custody of ballots in some places was lost having ballots floating around seems a recipe for election tampering or votes to simply get lost through incompetence
and republicans are not removing people without notifying them when a voter on a voter roll is challenged the state tries to contact that person to verify their voter registration
so she potentially voted illegally that 's a crime did she do it accidentally certain ky sounds like it and maybe common sense should have played its part and the court should have simply given her a slap on the wrist like a fine or something that said ignorance of the law is also not a defence if you kill someone does it make it legal because you did n't know it was illegal to kill someone
i tend to forget this is a democrat echo chamber where dissent from the cult gets you down voted
i did n't read anything dishonest in that article about republicans then you did n't read the article
last i checked voting was a right we need to ensure easiest access to the ballot for all while maintaining election security not trying to make it as difficult to vote as possible in the name of said security
woodstock ga ap conservative activists in georgia and some other states are quietly pushing a way to remove names from the voting rolls without filing a formal legal challenge you 're saying they should be able to make challenges to keep things honest and accurate but the article above says that they 're trying to skip the challenge portion and just remove the names it 's right in the first sentence that 's what you 're advocating for widespread removals just months prior to the election without any advanced notice
they do n’t have to say it out loud for everyone else to be able to look at what they are actually doing
they ’re smart enough to not say it publicly but do they clean voter rolls in red dominated areas in white suburbs or just where it disproportionately affects democrats and minority voters
they said it in nc
maybe you should read the article before commenting because the whole article is about republican activists pressuring county election officials to remove voters from voter rolls without notifying the voter or giving them a chance to contest it it 's not the state of georgia conducting the voter purges it 's the counties the georgia secretary of state remindex election officials of the legal requirement to notify voters but the county officials do n't have uniform policies or procedures and they do n't report to him
and the entire article is about removing that requirement are you paying attention
you have n’t presented any evidence everything you say can easily be refuted you ’re pathetic knuckle dragging fascist “ a little voter roll purging is okay guys i do n’t understand the big deal hurdurrr ” hope you trip and fall and never wake up
they 're british and only speak the king 's english
definitely not my own spread it far and wide it helps when you do n’t think of or approach these people as rational beings
friendly reminder that trump wants to kill everyone in gaza
china seems like what he does
anyone who does n't vote biden because the us government supports israel is a complete fool the situation over there absolutely would become infinitely worse if trump is president
did n't he call it prime israeli waterfront real estate or was that kushner i was wrong it was kushner
at this point this should make it pretty clear as far as who not to vote for as far as the gaza issue is concerned
spoken like the true racist he has always been
it 's a real shame that without biden 's first 20 minutes we 'd be talking about how trump had the worst debate performance in history
guys we have to reset the political system by not voting is literal human sacrifice of the people you act like you care about
when he said he would ’ve prevented all the atrocities i cringe so hard that i went into the earth where i will live as a cicada for the next 13 to 17 years
the incessant 24 7 demonization of palestinians and total support for what israel has done in gaza made it possible for a major party nominee to use a nationality as a slur and neither the other major party nominee nor the moderators even care
yeah leftists who hate biden because of gaza you really want to help the guy who uses “ palestinian ” as an insult become president and decide how much help israel gets and how much aid palestine gets
morons biden is responsible for the genocide in gaza trump you 're like a bad palestinian now what
trump has used veteran sincerely and american mockingly as a slur how the fuck is it news to you that he 's also racist the magas like this
has it occurred to the tiktok crowd that the reason we give aid to israel is bc they give us intelligence on our enemies in the me in return
hahaha love this for all of the people that said they wo n’t vote for biden because of the israel aid
pretty sure hamas did that all on their own
this heightens his racist beliefs
but every media outlet is screaming joe looked sleepy 1 1 1 meanwhile trump was a fucking disaster lies deflection sharts and not a single fucking question answered as it was asked
and y’ all keep trying to turn “ zionist ” into a slur lol i hate trump with a fiery passion but whatever this article is trying to posit is probably the least egregious thing about the man
saw a tweet about how the debate was two old white fascists debating their own brands of fascism yes they are both exactly the same when it comes to what is happening in israel and palestine s
i still ca n’t believe all those stupid fucks chanting “ genocide joe ” this other guy they want to get elected does not care about anyone involved in the conflict
they do that just fine by themselves lol
i mean he ’s a terrible human being
went to a national teacher convention a few years ago a palestinian american teacher asked for resources to help prevent bullying of palestinian students and staff not only did people call her antisemitic she was given death threats all for wanting to stop harassment
ca n't wait till the word trump becomes a slur
and the protesters still think biden is the same
maybe more zionist liberal leaning people will realize they just sound like trump when it comes to palestinians
maybe they ’ll knock off the “ genocide joe ” garbage stop pogromming synagogues and call for the unconditional release of the hostages and for hamas to be destroyed no then they may reap what they have sown
hmmm we might get more pro palestinian votes than we 'd expected
nah people did that themselves when they made amd continue to make excuses for terrorists
ah yes reddit is quite the left wing echo chamber
i might vote for him because of that
pro palestinians “ ca n’t wait to vote for trump to show the man trump supports israel lalalalalalalala i ca n’t hear you it ’s more important i pretend to have the moral high ground trump 2024 ”
palestinians turned palestinian into a slur
maybe this will get the folks going around making false accusations of genocide to have a change of heart but probably not
keep that in mind pro gaza protesters
nah i ’m pretty sure it was hamas who did that
islamofascist would be the appropriate slur for palestinians
whereas biden just turned tens of thousands of palestinians and counting into corpses
what the actual phuk no he did n’t he just hates them because they ’re muslim and support a terrorist organization to run their government
palestinians voted in hamas and are terrorists
i loved that line biden is trying to play both sides and is doing it badly hence being a bad palestinian genius trump
“ but biden sounded a little hoarse so we should let trump kill muslims ” reddit right now
trump hates almost everyone i guess hate is the wrong word for some groups and it ’s more like “ does n’t find them useful ” but he ’s not exactly a “ for all americans ” type never mind the rest of the world
he literally said finish the job i do n't know how that could be more clear
but biden has n't stopped israel so i 'm gon na call him genocide joe and support trump instead
israel should finish the job trump
yeah but biden is just as bad he may not be as pro palestine as people want but you never get everything if you care about gaza and are american you can hold your nose and say you 're not voting for biden you 're voting to stop trump and you 'll be helping the palestinians way more than any possible protest you think trump will give a shit about protests if he gets in
he pulled the “ zionist ” reversal slur
trump wants to do it and biden is arming israel as it does it
friendly reminder that most of gaza wants to kill everyone is israel
looks like prime land to him to build a new trump tower and golf course
friendly reminder joe biden is also doing that currently
yeah biden is just going to let it happen that 's not actually better it 's just slower
malcom x portrayed it perfectly the conservative is dangerous but you know it because they are very open about them hating minorities the white liberal is even more dangerous because he acts like he is your friend when in reality he also isn t the white liberal is the worst enemy to america and the worst enemy to the black man “ i think that perfectly describes bidens gaza politics acting like he cares about gaza but in reality the us under biden supplies their deadliest weapons to israel
biden said everything but 2 000 pound bombs
unfortunately the russian sponsored tiktok videos are telling the left wing biden is genocidal
friendly reminder that palestinians are screwed regardless of who wins the real question is will losing the election wake up the dems to stop blindly supporting a country that takes our money but does n’t listen to us
friendly reminder that biden is literally providing the weapons to kill everyone in gaza right now
got a source so it does n’t seem like we are just fear mongering
friendly reminder that biden has sent exclusive % 20us%20has%20sent%20israel%20thousands%20of%202 000 pound%20bombs%20since%20oct % 207%20 % 20https%3a www reuters com world us has sent israel thousands 2000 pound bombs since oct 7 2024 06 28 so it seems to me this is an issue where biden and trump are quite aligned
and everyone on america that disagrees with him
trump literally said i 'd let them finish the job he is endorsing palestinian genocide
he moved the embassy to jerusalem to try to help trigger some kind of evangelical end times this is not a man of peace
there 's a middle ground between supporting israel and not supporting israel more so there 's a reason why this reasoning is n't working claiming it 'll be worse under trump comes across as feigning concern because it 's already bad now yes it 's already bad now but people do n't care because biden is president this stance alongside biden 's debate performance it feels like 2016 hillary on steroids
i do n't mean to shock you but i 'm not planning on voting for trump either
that 's a good reason to vote for a genocide in your mind i guess
may have been kushner but you know it ’s trumps mindset too a little genocide to get rid of these people and what wonderful real estate opportunities we may have sickening but true
he is not wrong with respect to the real estate this is the view of the biggest open air prison in the world gaza was a popular destination for west bank palestinians before hamas took over it is a seaside area in the mediterranean it is going to be like greece or any other seaside destination in the mediterranean you get rid of hamas and you put a savvy businessman in charge and gaza could be the next tourist destination for arabs in europe and the middle east
synagogues all over north america are having events to promote selling off that land as real estate this rhetoric is what trump voters want
i was mentally pleading for the moderators to ask him for an example of a black job
haha i thought that was fucking racist af when trump said that
i chose not to vote for the guy currently funding genocide or the guy who promises to also do it but idk
is it still racism when every other neighbouring country feels the same way egypt jordan what 's left of libya they all want palestine wiped off the face of the earth for mostly the same reason
yeah i agree trump royally looked absolutely terrible and lied on purpose where everyone can see his deception
what are you talking about biden was bad the entire debate it was n’t just the first 20 minutes ignoring his performance is exactly why he thinks he should be running again and all it is going to do is turn us all into losers when we watch trump walk into the white house again you should be outraged that our party let us down you should be outraged that we are going to lose another damn 2 seats in the supreme court
he would 've looked at the atrocities and shrugged maybe let out a chuckle
demonization from who exactly it ’s republicans that have said that there ’s no innocent civilians in gaza it ’s a republican president that instituted the muslim ban let ’s put the blame on where it lies
maybe it was the october 7 terrorist attack raping and murdering over a thousand people that made people lose their sympathies
sort of like how the left uses zionist as a slur you mean
that particular group is made of the ultimate hypocrites given that they regularly try to cast zionist as an insult
two things can be bad at once
you how can biden be responsible for funding the genocide in gaza if a completely different person said something racist great logic there buddy
the only reason the us has enemies in me is because of support of israel
i ’ve heard people unironically call people “ zio ” as an insult
using zionist as a slur leftists literal nazis
tbf the term for any belief based on what your imaginary friend told you can easily be used as a slur although i think the zealots got an unfair deal because worshipping the roman emperor as a god is even more wacko than worshipping your imaginary friend
they 're not going to do that
reddit turned zionist into a slur well more so white supremacists turned it into a slur redditors are just following suit
i agree trump wo n’t pull pro palestine votes away from biden but the people making their decisions based on israel palestine are n’t rushing to the booth to vote for biden it ’s more likely they will feel disenfranchised and not vote or vote based on other issues
they also turned zionist into a slur with quite a bit of help from the left
well he ’s christian so he claims and i ’m sure many would consider the maga crowd a terrorist organization what ’s the difference
fyi it ’s spelled hoarse not trying to be a dick pedantic man away
i 've been on reddit a lot in the last 24 hours and have not come across anyone suggesting we should vote for trump or refrain from voting for biden i see many people wondering about the possibility of biden stepping down i 'm not on right wing subs but i am on several of the default subs who the fuck are you talking about
people are allowed to be concerned when their best option is clearly not a good one we are allowed to be concerned when the best play is to put someone else in the race and that does n’t even seem to be a consideration
i mean i think mostly we 're all just realizing we 're doomed i have n't seen a lot of people personally upset by the age more just realizing how fucked we are edit you can stop telling me biden is cool folks it 's irrelevant to this subthread
he did n’t just sound a “ little hoarse ” do n’t downplay how fucking awful he sounded but yeah he could ’ve been literally in rigor mortis and i ’d still be voting for him
people want a better candidate to reduce the chance that trump wins but sure keep spouting nonsense and gaslighting people about biden and then when he loses to trump i ’m sure you will be quick to blame young people or some other easy scapegoat
we 're going to protest biden and call him genocide joe because he has n't declared war against israel palestinian protesters and no we wo n't protest against trump because he 'll deport us also palestinian protesters
“ biden administration sent money to a long standing ally that was determined by the republican ronald regan in the 80s let ’s vote for trump instead ” morons
to be fair a lot of people on the far left and some muslim groups in michigan have already said “ netanyahu hates biden loves trump but biden has n’t single handily ended the rule of likud so trump would be better for palestine ”
although there are also christians and atheists in gaza and palestinian jews are a thing
we ’ve been letting biden kill muslims without much pushback what exactly is the difference that trump will be more enthusiastic about supporting genocide than biden that s not a good argument murder is murder
more like why are people wanting to vote for genocidal joe right now as tiktok calls him i find it funny
biden looked like death and we should choose someone who will win to represent the party i ’ll still vote for him but i was getting flashbacks to dying relatives he ’s not the right candidate
what are you talking about they both support the genocide biden is no better than trump on this issue
did you forget biden is the one currently funding the genocide
there are more than 2 choices
i blame the democrats they demonized both romney and mccain when they were actually decent candidates that wanted best for the nation and both even showed this when mccain refused to strike down obama care and romney refusing to take part in the maga republicans charade now we have the real devil about to take power and because the democratic party cried wolf before no one is listening now this man went on record and said he wanted to ban and deport muslims from the united states like i get it you do n’t love biden politics but holy fuck
and biden has stopped how many palestinian deaths
i think thinks he 's above is the phrase you 're after he does n't see anyone who is n't white and or rich as a person
i mean if trump is elected israel gets whatever they want and gulf states will go along with it because trump will sell them us arms again mena outside hezbollah houthis and iran could really give a fuck about israel their all looking at iran who trying to destabilize the region however they can
trump will turn a blind eye to anything that happens in palestine and use violence to silence any protests
he may not be as pro palestine as people want i do n't need him to be pro palestinian i just want him to be anti genocide which apparently is unreasonably high bar to expect from a presidential candidate
and most of israeli jews do n't support humanitarian aid to gaza which nation has 750 000 settlers in the others territory
considering israel is engaging in genocidal acts in the west bank sounds like they deserve each other
genuine question how do you propose it is fixed because honestly anyone other than the parties involved sitting down and finding a solution is n’t going to work people outside of this ca n’t fix it from outside
exactly the difference is just appearance not actions
you ’re right it is n’t much better but it is better
and trump responded with israel should finish the job
biden said civilians should not be harmed under any circumstances
not really israel got those too
way more people would be killed w trump than biden so either you really care about each life or you are grandstanding
the real question is will losing the election wake up the dems to stop blindly supporting a country that takes our money but does n’t listen to us this sounds like the shit that got us trump and all that followed in the first place i hope no dem or left leaning folks are abstaining voting for 3rd party or voting for trump to teach the dems a lesson
losing the election means we 'll never have one again palestine will be glassed and your queer and female friends are in actual mortal danger sure both sides are the same
the real question is will losing the election wake up the dems to stop blindly supporting a country that takes our money but does n’t listen to us no every loss since bush has seen them going farther right we got ta get more moderate is the only takeaway they 've ever taken from serious losses this was the same argument in 2016 how 'd that work out they also tried it in 2000 and in 2004 did it work those times
can you eli5 why the jews in israel should be screwed and the muslims in palestinian territories should not be screwed because it sure seems like over the last 76 years the arabs and palestinians keep losing its fight against israel and usually when you fight and lose you get screwed
he was referring to removing the terrorist infrastructure like tunnels and dismantling hamas along with rebuilding with things like not having their education curriculums include how jews should be killed to be clear i am voting for biden and am scared by the idea of a trump second term but suggesting that israel wants to kill every last person in gaza which by the way is what hamas attempted to do they would have killed every last israeli if they were n't stopped on 10 7 needs to be responded to
it 's not genocide palestinians are just arabs
claiming it 'll be worse under trump comes across as feigning concern trump has used ' palestinian ' as a slur at least twice now and he thinks of them as subhuman he has a record of disseminating against muslims from his first term he 's gone on record saying he 'll deport people for being pro palestinian he 's repeatedly said he wants israel to ' finish the job ' in gaza two of his closest advisors have talked about owning beachfront property in gaza there 's no ' feigning concern ' because he made his thoughts on them loud and clear
it will absolutely be worse under trump i only have to ask my mom who wants us on the ground in israel to kill all palestinians deport them to other countries and destroy them because they 're muslims you are very naive about americans a large portion of americans are actually openly explicitly bigoted towards muslims they want them completely dead 100 % dead not dead in a puppet regime way but american gis sent door to door killing them in an act of mass murder with the idf half the country is very vocal about this i see billboards for it all the time biden is stopping this by throttling the ammunition transfers and preventing netanyahu from going all the way with his conquest plans trump would do the opposite he would give them american infantry divisions naval artillery and airstrikes on anything that moves there run them out and burn anything that stays and most americans are aware of this half of them want it
hey foreigners stop telling us americans to give trump the benefit of the doubt he lied about covid lies about his ties to russia lies about the nuclear secrets he stole and held at maralogo lied about blackmailing ukraine for political favors lied about sleeping with a pornstar while his wife was pregnant with his youngest son and lied about the path of a hurricane he bold face lies about objective facts all time completely insane behavior to think you have a clue on trumps thought process and that you think you can spin it positively
it 's not perfect so who cares if it is worse thanks for your performative concern
that just sounds like voting for trump with extra steps
i do nt really understand the point you 're trying to make here the election is binary either biden will win or trump will win since that 's reality it means that not voting for biden only helps trump if trump becomes potus the situation over there will become much much worse so if you actually care about the palestinian people a vote for biden is the only logical choice you do them great harm if you decide to not vote or not vote for biden
you think one hotel is an indicator for the entire region the vast majority of people staying at that hotel were foreigners the average gazan who is living in poverty can not afford to stay in a hotel actually fuck you for even thinking about real estate in this situation when thousands of civilians are starving to death just get rid of hamas like it 's something so simple israel themselves radicalized hamas even funded them to destabilize gaza who is your idea of a savvy businessman jared kushner because you sound a lot like his soulless ass right now
i 'm sure tourists would flock to a place where children playing on the beach are target practice for israelis oh sorry i forgot history begum on october 7th
my suspicion is that he meant jobs in predominantly black areas but he 's still a stinking racist
so if either of them is equally bad for gaza 100 % they ’re not trumps much worse then you should consider gaza a null issue and just look at the other issues for how to vote this moronic ass rhetoric is like the trolley problem but if on track a current track john and jack get killed or on track b only john gets killed and then choosing not to switch to track b because fuck it either way john ’s dead like dumbass millions jacks are gon na get fucked on track a vote for biden edit to make it even clearer these are the undeniable facts groups biden is worse for the extremely rich only fiscally groups trump is worse for women middle class impoverished parents single parents any racial or ethnic minority disabled people palestinians immigrants nato g7 america ’s allies the climate world and ofc fans of democracy at the end of the day this has never been about the issues the issues are clear and settled for anyone who cares to look it ’s about a populist appealing to voters so disaffected and delusional that they do n’t see him for what he is a con man
yes yes it ’s still racist let ’s rephrase that make it easier to understand “ is it still racist to hate black people if all my neighbors in hate them too ”
nope you need the incumbent advantage against trump running another democrat that does n’t have presidential experience gives trump an advantage
ask john fetterman dan goldman jared moskowitz ritchie torres debbie wasserman schultz adam schiff etc
i 'm curious do you feel the same way about american people us government destroyed the lives of millions directly and indirectly around the world for decades should those countries hold american civilians responsible would you still feel they would be justified in bombing and starving thousands and thousands of innocent children because of it
“ lose their sympathies ” please spare me sympathy for palestinians or arabs has been non existent in american life since 9 11 but glad to know that 10 7 justifies the unfiltered racial hatred that a fascist spewed on a national debate last night in your opinion
one can be bad and one can be nation erasing off the face of the earth bad basically
that is such a fucking online insult if i ’ve ever heard one
because opposing one nationalist ideology means supporting another nationalist ideology
umm no for one thing zionist is not a slur zionism is a political religious movement with it 's own motives and agendas thus if you are part of this movement you are a zionist next israel 's long apartheid against palestine is a crime against humanity wanting this apartheid to end and palestine to be free of israel control does not make anyone a nazi the opposite in fact should be argued lastly any criticism of isreal being immediately and constantly lambasted as anti semitism is a farce a comparison between nazism and zionism would be more far more apt than the one you made between leftists and nazis and it 's actually been made many times in the last 100 years and there is research and facts to prove it democrats supporting all of this under the guise of any other veiwpoint or belief is anti semitic is actually tragic the horrors committed against jewish people during the holocaust and what the bible claims does not give israel unchecked cart blanche over palestine and yet that is exactly what is happening and what we are allowing to happen
while some people certainly hold it as such zionism is n't dependent on said imaginary friend most of us do n't believe it to be
it does n't really sound like you know what you 're talking about but okay man
true it would require being in touch with reality
biden doubling down on the military support for israel was a take in the meantime what ’s happened in israel we ’re finally the only thing i ’ve denied israel was 2 000 pound bombs they do n’t work very well in populated areas they kill a lot of innocent people we are providing israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them thing is there are some pro palestine votes that might go trump prior to 9 11 those voters swung hard for democrats when the perception became that republicans were anti muslim thing is if some older socially or economically conservative muslim voters end up thinking biden is no better those votes could flip it ’s not a big bloc but the muslim community in michigan and minnesota is sizable and some of those votes could be in play in states where the margins in 2016 and 2020 were quite narrow
half the us are terrorists now good one
i heard biden go “ neyyy ” and shake his head so he sounded like a horse not hoarse
you ’re one syllable off from a haiku so close
now you sound horse you nay sayer
no i think op meant biden was a little horse like he was galloping along in the debate but only in tiny hoof pony trots
a hoarse horse is a horse of course of course unless you are talking to a hoarse horse of course
what this about a hoarse dick
if they were quoting reddit the typos would definitely apply
nah he sounded like a pony
he ’s a pedantic pontificating old bastard
it 's literal gaslighting it 's insulting to the rest of us and just extremely out of touch
a lot of this sub equates any criticism of biden with advocacy for trump it ’s very much driven by fear i understand they but it really pushes us into that gop style cult mindset
the best play is not to change candidates this late in the game do n’t fall for russian propaganda
i think ' doomed ' is putting it a bit strongly dude 's been president for 3 and a half years and the executive branch has shown to be extremely effective and competent under biden yeah you can argue policy but ca n't argue that the various departments especially the state and treasury depts as well as the office of the director of national intelligence are n't running fantastically especially after being gutted to skeleton crews under trump oratory skills are overrated obama owns every room he walks into but i think biden runs a tighter ship than he did
the thing is the office and our country are much bigger than the potus biden has a very competent and capable team around him trump will be surrounded by people who want to break our system in countless ways and take us back a century centralize power in unprecedented ways that is truly frightening
we ai n't fucked the normal human response is to panic but fuck that we got a job to do and biden ai n't crying about last night he 's on the trail i truly respect someone who shits the bed and does n't let that stop them i 've done it anyone who ever tried anything or had a lot pressure on them blew it it 's an office and he has more relationships in dc world than most naw it 's go time
a president is n't a king there is a whole administration that comes with them they each have people who can do their jobs well you just have to pick the administration that 's heading in a direction that you like more
go vote for supreme court justices if nothing else congress would be great be we ca n’t let them pack the court anymore
if young people do n’t vote dem you do n’t care about making progress on any issues you claim to care about
the people who are evaluating trump and biden only according to their personalities and personal strengths and weaknesses are complete fools who do n’t have any idea whatsoever how far reaching and impactful the decision to elect one or the other truly is military generals cabinet members agency heads fbi directors fed chairs federal judges scotus justices you name it everyone is appointed by the president and the president has younger competent experts and dependable people who advise him on all those matters tell these folks you know who think we ’re all “ doomed ” because biden and trump are our two choices again in 2024 to help themselves to a fucking education about what the president ’s powers actually entail americans are becoming so dumb and poorly educated on how their country even works that it ’s not hard to see why they so easily toss all remaining democratic traditions to the wind at this point
sometimes god sends us an imperfect vessel
agreed we finally beat medicare is n't a little hoarse and a little stutter i 'm going to vote for biden if i have to crawl through barbed wire to get to the polls but trying to gaslight people into pretending he did n't have an absolutely awful debate is just nuts and he really needed a good debate
yeah i love the fucking spin it 's like real men shit themselves maga level spin the dude obviously forgot what he was talking about more than once at a presidential debate go and vote for the guy if you want but do n't tell me he 's a great option that just had a bad night
it all feels very sunk cost fallacy
and there are people who said vaccines do n’t work and died with tubes down their throats begging for horse deworming drugs what was your point stupid people exist
nobody is saying that and lying is not helpful biden can suspend weapons sales that ’s all we want even if he ca n’t end the gazan genocide we do n’t need to actively support it
k so you want to find out what a trump backed bibi would do
ok your complaint is noted and has been repeated ad nauseum by others who and what is your solution exactly
oh biden has a muslim ban he recognizes illegally occupied areas as part of israel they ’re not the same
but what it is n't is a suggestion to vote trump never said it was what are you trying to say
the upcoming elections are n't for what is happening now on 29 june 2024 they are to choose what you want to happen between 6 january 2025 to 6 january 2029
the topic has been analyzed your statement is false in the current first past the post system
oh yeah blame democrats for what republicans are doing been hearing that since newt gingrich and the 90s
yeah in hindsight mccain and romney were moderate puppy dogs but it was reasonable to assume the worst following the gop run of nixon reagan and the bush boys nixon was hair away from being criminally convicted and sabotaged peace effort in vietnam reagan and bush sold cracked to inner city african american communities and sabotaged hostage negotiations in iran and bush junior lied about a 20 year war that destabilized the whole region to this day and each of them anteceded an economic recession
a lot he 's negotiated a ton of aid
i do n't know how many palestinians did he save by finally beating medicare has to be at least a couple
he does n't see anyone who is n't white and or rich as a person fixed that for you
trump is great for israel but total chaos for everything else instability in ukraine it 's looking really grim right about now
and that differs from now how
the houthis flag literal says god is the greatest death to america death to israel a curse upon the jews victory to islam da fuck you mean they do n't give a fuck about it
i am absolutely terrified for the people of gaza and ukraine if trump wins
trump will increase military aid with the goal of killing all palestinians you 're getting one of them who is worse
aid to israel is a drop in the bucket for them in exchange for intelligence given to us democrats should know better
what this is happing on biden ’s watch right now are you not watching the campus protests he is quick to call them antisemitic our house passed a bill to criminalize the students
for real though democrats always sold themselves as the moral and ethical party but when it comes foreign policy concerning brown people they could n’t give less of a fuck like i have n’t heard a good defense from them regarding israel ’s massacre it ’s always “ it would be worse under trump ” try looking a palestinian in the eye and saying that shit as a reason to vote for biden over trump
i do n't agree with the blocking of aid by israel but it would make sense for those involved that they would n't support feeding a nation that wants to exterminate them in the same way i 'm sure hamas does n't support other countries proving support to israel both sides have been playing dirty however everything israel is accused of doing hamas has already committed worse the people of gaza and all other muslim countries need to reject hamas and it 's teachings and remove them from the country because until that happens there will never be the peace they want for themselves the offers of a ceasefire are on the table all they need to do is act in good faith and accept one of the many deals proposed
we by which i mean all nations supporting israel not just yours could stop providing them with the means to commit genocide that would be a good start
american politics in a nutshell
the result is the exact same
they ’re going to do it regardless who is going to stop them both sides lick aipac ’s boots
who cares what he says if his actions do n't align with it
they did not get the shipment that was delayed yet that 's still being addressed your article speaks to shipments to date since oct 7 not each individual shipment u s and israel resolve weapons supply problems but 2 000 lb bombs still on holdu s and israel resolve weapons supply problems but 2 000 lb bombs still on hold
like i said they are screwed either way biden has done absolutely nothing to stop the illegal land grabs in the west bank absolutely zero tangible things so let ’s see what happens when trump wins and everyone not just the palestinians hurt trump is going to be absolutely horrible for all of us you me our families etc but maybe all that suffering will wake up the dems to stop blindly supporting a country with our tax dollars when that country ca n’t be bothered to listen to us when it matters
oh it ’s going to happen biden is definitely going to lose minnesota and michigan and you ’ll see a lot of 3rd party dem votes to send a message
palestine does n’t actually exist right now our politics has ensured that
every loss since bush has seen them going farther right that 's third way their answer is always to move right dems really need to dump them
in that case they do n’t deserve to govern
what did the palestinians in the west bank do why do they deserve to lose their land
but suggesting that israel wants to kill every last person in gaza which by the way is what hamas attempted to do they would have killed every last israeli if they were n't stopped on 10 7 needs to be responded to the point is that trump wants that
it 's amazing how much this needs repeating but thank you for doing so if israel wanted genocide there would not be anyone left in gaza years ago
no the idf is n't trying to dismantle the current power structure in gaza it 's trying to wipe out the palestinians they would n't blow up every single fucking institution every school every university every courthouse and hospital if they were there would not be killing zones if there was an intent to start a new palestinian gaza there sure as fuck would n't be the equivalent of concentration camps where people held without charge are electrocuted by metal rods inserted up their anuses as an israeli whistleblower reported to the new york times this is all a pathetic post hoc attempt to claim that the palestinians are worse than the israelis even though the israeli military was committing worse atrocities than 10 7 against the palestinians and lebanese for years before 2023 such as 2014 's operation protective edge 2018 's march of return mass shootings the sabra and shatila massacre etc hell they already had thousands of palestinians held indefinitely without charge when 10 7 happened which would be considered a hostage situation if palestinians were n't considered subhuman by red and blue maga
denialism of palestinian identity as distinct from arabs is literally a part of genocide lmao
i 'm not sure that they 're only killing the ones they can get their hands on is the airtight defence you might assume it to be
so when all the palestinians are dead and there 's no more palestinians what do we call that awesome cide total obliteration of a people but cool
so where 's the concern for what 's currently happened over the past nine months under biden where 's the criticism where 's the pressure
poor interpretation the militant way people refuse to accept any criticism of biden is no better to maga defending trump and yet people wonder why swing disaffected and young voters are not interested in voting for biden and why he 's polling poorly
well by that same logic since i 'm also not voting for trump that just sounds like voting for biden with extra steps
my most charitable interpretation would be that he meant jobs created that went on to be filled by black people but then he could 've just said black employment or something similar
palestinian is n't a skin colour nor a race it 's a nationality it 's not racism to hate one black guy when all other black guys hate that scumbag too people do n't hate palestinians because they 're brown they 're hated because terrorism is in their culture it 's not just israel they want every country in the middle east that gave refuge to the palestinian people or it 's government had been subject to endless terrorist attacks assassinations and political coups as they try to bite the hand that feeds and try to take over under the islamic law of conquest palestinians have a beggar bowl in one hand and a long knife in the other keep that in mind whenever legacy media quickly glace over the fact that despite an alleged genocide of muslims taking place isarel 's neighbours keep their border closed
by that logic jimmy carter should go for a second term the incumbent advantage has diminishing returns after a certain age
so they have actually demonized palestinian civilians or hamas i ’m sure you ’d have a ton of evidence to back this up
exactly with these people 's logic 9 11 was justified it 's ridiculous
comparing america to jihadic radical regions is pretty deranged the better comparison for gaza are germans during ww2 hamas is literally a genocidal entity read their charter
gaza ’s elected government is hamas as a reminder you think they are acting civilly in their media look at their charter it includes genocide actual religiously motivated genocide
looks like there not going be a palestinian state by the end of this
at every single anti zionist event y' all hold there are palestinian nationalist flags everywhere at every single event every single one but please tell me more about how y' all totally do n't support palestinian nationalism
zionist is not a slur a comparison between nazism and zionism would be far more apt holy shit that is an impressive lack of self awareness
you are a very confused individual
holy shit this subreddit fucking blows
the reality is prolonged occupation is exactly the kind of help palestinians need
i do n’t think half the us associate themselves with being maga
actually it 's spelled neigh not nay pedantic man it is i pedantic lad
neigh sayer get it right
that ’d explain his dislike of dog faced pony soldiers
honestly it 's the gaslighting that terrifies me more than biden 's performance i 've been down voted and called a trump supporter by fellow democrats on reddit for months just for saying that a lot of people are struggling financially bill clinton said i feel your pain but so many democrats seem to be saying anyone who does n't say things are great are our enemies
as out of touch as throwing women and people under the bus because biden is n’t your dream boat date to the prom must be nice knowing a trump term wo n’t affect you that a privilege others do n’t have you should n’t misuse therapy speak btw
from my experience as long as you acknowledge that trump is way worse and or that you still plan on voting for biden people will leave you be if you criticize biden hell most people will even agree and upvote that 's the difference people know that biden is n't infallible he 's just a necessary evil
because a lot of the criticism is unfair and ginned up controversy there ’s a huge media arm that is very keen on getting trump back in office either for ratings or organized campaigns run for foreign governments ask yourself what is productive are you going to be out and about sewing dissent when a candidate has literally said “ i ’ll only be a dictator on day one ” we ’re way past the point safety when it comes to guardrails for democracy in america time to circle the wagons is biden perfect no but i question the motives of everyone who wants to bring up his failures every chance they get for “ criticism ” maybe you need to reevaluate your arguments in a way where it does n’t seem like you ’re trying for the “ both sides ” propaganda angle
biden being too old is n't russian propaganda and saying that is n't an endorsement of trump
biden and trump have been polling nationally at 50 50 that ’s already a loosing popular vote score for democrats thursday is going to hurt biden more than felonies hurt trump you should be angry that democrats decided to run a puppet instead of finding someone reasonable in 2021 this is a failure of leadership and strategy and the country will suffer the consequences
oratory skills are useless when debating the famous chess playing pigeon
we are n’t doomed because of the possibility of biden round 2 that would be fine we ’re doomed because it ’s looking less and less likely that he ’ll win and he seems to be too cocky to acknowledge that and hand over the reins
we are doomed my man obama was n’t being protested for a genocide and americans do n’t vote on policy
if that ’s the case then it should be no problem to put that team around a different healthier younger democrat if it ’s vote blue no matter who let ’s try another no matter who
i swear if some of these people were alive in 1942 they ’d have the us surrendered to the axis by now
trump has drooled out far far stupider strings of sentences and plenty of voters are willing to forget and ignore it for once trust in the ignorance of the average american
when we ’re fighting modern fascism i ’d prefer a leader who did n’t shit the bed the first time he had to think for himself in months
ehh sometimes that ’s not good enough he ’s a pilot who just flew into a mountainside by accident you do n’t get a do over for that
that would be a great political campaign
project 2025 look into it
that ’s how american elections work bro i do n’t like it either but here we are
these people act like they do n’t have their own agency in the matter biden is old and incompetent yet he ’s been doing a great job for the past 3 and half years if you believe that biden wo n’t last another 4 years then throwing your hands up and letting the facist win is n’t the freaking answer maybe start volunteering and donating to make sure biden and democrats get elected
there is no god we must save ourselves
biden also made abortion about immigration when abortion is the most strongest point for democrats he could have blasted trump but handed him a platter by talking about immigration so abortion topic never went on to talk about much
dems on this sub still fucking acting like biden was just fine
yea but at least those idiots mostly only hurt themselves these are people pretending to be “ allies ” to i do n’t know who whose response will hurt not only everyone whose rights they pretend to care about in america but will 100 % lead to much more palestinian suffering too which is what they are pretending their main motivator for not voting biden is
he can step down we can use the 25th amendments the dnc can step in literally any prominent democrat is better and the sooner we do it the more time they have to campaign
he 's supporting a genocide when the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for israeli war criminals he said we do n't recognize their jurisdiction i do n't care if he 's not as bad as trump trump is n't the president
we 're witnessing the logical progression of blue no matter who mentality where libs now openly defend genocide it 's so wild
he 's terrible for israel as he will enable the suicidal path they are on
you are n't terrified for the people of gaza right now
our house is republican controlled
in the same way i 'm sure hamas does n't support other countries proving support to israel i 'm not talking about support solely about humanitarian aid the key difference is that israel controls gaza 's borders and has been able to implement the genocidal starvation of gaza by blocking humanitarian aid the people of gaza and all other muslim countries need to reject hamas and it 's teachings and remove them from the country because until that happens there will never be the peace they want for themselves hamas only existed as a significant force in the 80s and 90s was there peace before that was there peace before october 7th will getting rid of hamas change the fact israel has spent multiple decades settler colonising palestine will getting rid of hamas also lead to israel withdrawing the 750 000 israeli jewish settlers from palestinian lands is your concept of peace simply a peaceful settler colonialism and occupation
israel produces their own arms american aid is what gives us what little leverage we do have with them
even if that did happen the war would n’t stop
well no because that would just strengthen the palestinians hezbollah to continue their attacks genocides
aipac is n’t in the top 10 largest lobbying groups in the country
just it happen it ’s not worth the fight over it
i understand that ’s how ridiculous biden ’s stance on israel is everyone is making a big deal about one shipment of bombs but he ’s literally let everything else through including bypassing congress it send israel weapons trump would be terrible for palestinians but it ’s not like biden has been good for them either
there is no path forward at that point voting rights will be decimated even more we probably already passed the tipping point but it would be a nail in the coffin not to mention scotus going even more conservative using violence on american protestors federal abortion ban possibly so many things all to teach dems a lesson and motivate people more for a hypothetical next time
even were trump elected and gaza wiped off the face of the earth the lesson would not be that young people did n't like aipac the lesson would be that people thought biden was too old and frail you are just pissing in the wind with your protest vote why is aipac your focus for ire and not any of the other thousands of pacs that push bullshit policies everyday you would vote for the objectively worse candidate on just about every issue and make the country worse off in the height of your privilege
if the people who actually vote are indicating as a group they prefer the party more to right it sounds like a natural consequence of survivorship if the party that well is n't left but it closer to that side starts winning because people are turning out to vote for that things will move left
i ’m not saying the muslims are the only belligerents and the jews are faultless in this conflict just that the muslims keep losing both sides have made this a zero sum endeavor and hardliners in israel do not believe there is any reasonable olive branch that would convince muslims to stop attacking them so if you ’re going to be attacked no matter what you may as well expand your territory right pretty easy logic i find it laughable that “ just be nice to the palestinians ” will sufficiently result in peace and harmony israel will lose some enemies and there will be fewer protests but the “ death to israel ” terror groups are n’t going to suddenly be pacified so i do not think there will be peace and if i have to choose between the only jewish state with less than 10 thousand square miles of territory or the islamic world with over 10 million square miles of territory well
he does when did he say that what do you consider genocide
thank you for bringing up that israel has done many october 7ths before hamas did their one octover 7th people are trying to rewrite history to claim it all began on october 7th because they do n't want anyone to know what happened before
no the 5 things that define genocide are listed in article ii do n't just make things up it weakens your argument
even in your fantasy land in which gaza the west bank are eliminated palestinians would still outnumber israelis by 3 1
why is an australian trying to convince americans how we should decide our election anyways and dismissing the very real main issues that a fascist brings to the table we get two choices old crypt keeper or the fking angry orange fascist i ’m choosing the geriatric who still believes in the concept of democracy even if i do nt like some steps he s taken as president nows really not the time for bad faith actors slacktivists from overseas to try to meddle with our politics just cus they ’re bored during dinner
there is n’t any concern from these libs they only care about how they ’ll be materially impacted on the us they do n’t care about palestinians or the active genocide being waged against them only that they might start losing out on their rights if they elect the other pro genocide guy
okay except for you 're taking votes from the one presidential candidate that supports bodily autonomy gay rights and following the laws are you saying that you are doing that becuase of a single issue
yeah hating palestinians is less like hating black people and more like hating black hebrew israelites palestinian nationalism is a political ideology not an ethnicity
being obtuse about it wo n’t alter reality giving unyielding absolute support to the atrocity being committed in gaza by racial supremacists like netanyahu and ben gvir absolutely contributes to the demonization of palestinians
with these people 's logic october 7 was justified consistency is not the point
it actually is how bin laden justified it
i 'm not talking about hamas at all sure they are a bunch of fanatical terrorists but there are hundreds of thousands of innocents that has no choice but to live under them i 'm not comparing us to hamas in a political sense i 'm comparing their actions and results and whether your argument extends to atrocities committed by us government or not
palestine has n't had an election since 2006 and the median age of gaza is 18 so please explain how literal children voted for hamas
unelected government actually the last time hamas won an election was 18 years ago and the legislature they won seats in is defunct they control gaza by virtue of winning a brief civil war and then establishing complete authoritarian control
so having a bad government is reason enough to call for genocide btw why do you think they voted for them in the first place
i ’m no sympathizer but can you blame them after everything they dealt with since 1948
quite the statement please explain
til reading and studying history instead of what my modern media tells me makes me confused thanks although i guess it makes sense that i sound confused when my sources are other than what the president and biased news and social media tells me
and so you ’re struggling financially and you think it ’s gon na get better if you try and lay that at the democratic party ’s feet both sides are not the same call your republican representatives and ask them why they are always letting big business get away with it
itt horseshoe theory of politics it just goes to show that the behavior of extremists on the left and the right tends to be very similar both demand cult like devotion to their appointed figurehead without criticism just because i recognize trump is the worst possible choice and am therefore voting for biden does not mean i 'm obliged to check my brain at the door and fail to recognize biden 's many shortcomings that 's the biggest difference between republicans and everyone else extreme leftists who behave exactly like magas are a big part of the problem
it ’s the same fear that got the gop to trump anything was acceptable if it kept the other side out of power and any dissent was a threat to that mission
he literally said “ biden should step down so we can protect all these important issues ” and you said “ that ’s why you hate women ” maybe you ’re as old as biden and that ’s why you were n’t bothered during the debate
as out of touch as suggesting that strawman yes
must be nice knowing a trump term wo n’t affect you that a privilege others do n’t have i guarantee your life was nt a single iota different from 2016 2019
i mean yeah if leftists throw this election again we get a dictatorship i literally do n’t care how you feel about joe biden in your heart of hearts i care what you do at the ballot box
who is allowed and almost encouraged by cnn to shit on the board and walk away then the media says “ well the bird won fair and square ” it ’s sick a man tells naked lies for an entire debate and the media has the gall to say “ he won ” we need to establish a fairness doctrine again
exactly i do n’t have any issues with a second biden term i think he ’d do a fine job as would harris if he does n’t make it four years my issue is i do n’t think he can win that second term he ’s good at the job but not the sales part of winning it not anymore
you could get newsom or if you want someone with a little less baggage josh shapiro democrats who are much younger who would have essentially the same policies and people in an administration as biden
nah we ’d be insisting on actually joining the war against hitler rather than trying to talk it out a win the germans over to our side diplomatically by adopting their immigration policies
also people forget how close the civil war was in the beginning it was not looking good for awhile it 's time to dig in
it 's exactly what we all accuse the gop of just flat out ignoring unpleasant realities we 're so fucked i mean i 'm gon na vote for the mummy but fucks sake
ok so you do n’t have a who you have no data to support your claim you do n’t seem to understand incumbency brand recognition and national trends and your invocation of the 25th is very out of touch let ’s be realistic you do n’t have a plan you have complaints
trump is n't the president do you want to find out what will happen if he is
can you give me the definition of genocide that you 're using and then show me how it applies to what is happening because as far as i can tell over 20 % of the population of israel itself is palestinians thousands of the soldiers in the idf are palestinians so how exactly is it that a group that contains a substantial amount of palestinians can commit a genocide on palestinians even if all of gaza and the west bank became israel it would not be a genocide just because it 's sad that a lot of people are dying does n't mean you get to just make up new meanings for words i mean i guess you can but nobody with critical thinking skills is going to take your position seriously hence the support for israel on both sides of the political spectrum here in the us i mean we have people like bowman who want to say that the people who got raped on oct 7th were liars but he does n't get to be in the squad anymore because he lost his primary i guess people do n't like it when you call rape victims liars and say that jews need to stop sticking together so much
the path israel is on is n’t suicidal in the slightest no country is going to do anything significant to them while the usa backs them and the usa will back them no matter who gets in office biden trump rfk do n’t matter so they can continue to ravage gaza for as long as their govt wishes and not much will change for them i do n’t see how it ’s even somewhat suicidal
the suicidal path of actually eliminating their enemies horrible
that was a bad faith question but you just reminded me of why i spent so long avoiding political subs
as long as there is such strong dogmatic religious beliefs in those areas then i do n't know if there can ever be peace to be honest so until they can bring themselves to adapt to modern values and actually take heed of science first over religion then maybe no maybe there will never be peace but getting rid of extremist terrorist organisations posing as a democratic society is one way to start getting towards that position also there should have been some level of peace before october 7th as there was a ceasefire in place which was then broken by hamas and palestine palestine could have focused on economic growth even within the small areas it holds as opposed to funneling any aid into weapons and tunnel infrastructure to attempt to continue to destroy israel they could live side by side as one country but they wo n't because again you have a religion which has core beliefs that these other people are their enemies perhaps we can convince hamas to accept a ceasefite stick to it and resolve the issues through politics and reason rather than war but i ca n't see palestine accepting any of that do you have a proposal of how to actually fix this issue other than allowing terrorists to role play as governments
then use it if you have that leverage why does the us refuse to use it it 's because they support the ethnic cleansing being carried out by the western colony
that 's not a good enough reason to do nothing
this conflation of all palestinians and hamas did n't even get the right organisation average zionist iq is contributing to the ongoing genocide get a grip by the way israel does not have a right to exist if so called israelis went home the region would be perfectly safe
it ’s cute you think that there was guardian story out just the other day about how deep this goes and how many organizations are not even registered with the government
rebuild what this is n’t just about gaza gaza is the result look at what has been happening in the west bank pretend gaza does n’t exist right now and just look at what has been happening in the west bank for decades regardless of who is in office dems or republicans palestinians will suffer this vote is to send a message to the dems that they need to stop licking aipac ’s boots and start paying attention to american interests republicans will never stop licking their boots because of their apocalyptic prophecies but maybe dems will wake up the younger generation is already tired of their crap if dems want to govern again they need to make some changes to their foreign policy
do you not understand why he 's paused the shipment of 2000 lb bombs it 's not ridiculous at all you use those bombs to level city blocks as israel has done so he 's limiting these and instead giving more precision munitions it 's saying we do n't want to help you level city blocks and increase civilian casualties but aid you targeting hamas with more precise arms it 's not an easy place to be with israel and the ramifications especially when israel is often working against his efforts because bibi prefers trump he 's sure done more including trying to get aid into gaza than trump ever would either it 's lipstick on a pig but it 's better than the alternative also keep in mind there 's a legal mandate to provide arms to israel so technically as they deplete their arsenal we signed up to replenish them we made ourselves their armory and it crosses parties and presidencies so he 's not ' went around congress ' when it 's already law to do so legally the u s ca n’t cut israel off completely since 2008 the u s has had to weigh all arms sales to israel and other countries in the region against the requirement that israel maintains a “ qualitative military edge ” against all enemies both state and non state actors which was further amended in 2012 and 2014 and probably other times after the withdrawal from iraq
citizens collectively get the leaders they deserve these sorts of things should have been thought about before blindly supporting countries that take our money and tell us to pound sand
perhaps you are not familiar with the young people protesting all across the country so much so that israel has been throwing money at lobbyists to get them to change laws criminalizing saying things against israel
third way moves right after wins too the whole point is closing the gap but with the gop galloping further and further right that send third way further and further right too they believe they do n't have to appease anyone to the left because who else are they going to vote for but that only works up to a point how that works in the real world is a huge voting block left completely unrepresented not wanting to vote for the far right party or for the not quite as far right party there is no one on the left for those votes dems need to dump third way
well that ’s your choice my choice is to keep foreign governments from having such a huge voice in american politics especially those governments that take our money and give us the middle finger my solution is to stop providing aid to a government that has a thriving economy and can take care of itself what hamas did is terrible but let israel deal with it on their own why do we have to get involved so you vote how you want and i ’ll vote how i want
during the debate biden said they did n't give isreal a certain type of bomb because it would kill more innocent people and cause more collateral damage after that is when trump made his we should let isreal finish the job comment the man has no care or concern about palestinian lives and does n't pretend like he gives a fuck
what ’s the issue with their point i do n’t know what moderates are missing here the response to “ i believe biden is supporting a genocide ” being “ trump will do it worse ” does n’t address the genocide concern we are n’t talking about trump we know he ’s an outright fascist so i ’d hope the opposition would hold themselves to a higher standard the bar for democrats is n’t supposed to be slightly better it ’s supposed to entirely different if i go out and kill 50 people in the street but my friend kills 50000 we ’re both going to jail the situation is n’t that you need to convince people not to vote for trump people need to be convinced to vote for biden democrats are unwilling entirely to address biden without also addressing trump and it will continue to lose them the progressive vote
people outside of the us have views and opinions shock horror the democrats can do as they please it did n't work in 2016 and the red flags are appearing again
you are operating under a flawed system in which biden is owed my vote and thus by not voting for him that vote is to paraphrase you taken away that is a pretty draconian system in my opinion i believe that in democracies politicians are not owed votes but rather must earn them
tell that to the 5 year olds in gaza they definitely actively chose their political ideology
so you actually do n’t have proof of them demonizing palestians the fact that you believe them supporting israel ’s response to a terrorist attack is equal to republicans on record saying shit like gaza is nice beachfront property israel should finish the job and israel should bomb the shit out of gaza is entirely part of the problem with how this conflict is viewed on the left
not sure when the last time american civilians participated in capturing hostages and r8ping and slaughtering civilians in a blitzkrieg it ’s not propaganda the israeli hostages were are held by civilians
they still support hamas i think that commenter is a child and is stupid but the fact is the vast majority of gazans support oct 7th
“ civilians ” are actively aiding in capturing hostages and committing violent acts of terrorism i think a war is justified and gaza militants should n’t use civilians as shields i do n’t really think that is a hot take it ’s really hamas dragging civilians into this
yes i can absolutely blame people who choose to pursue literal genocide as an actual government and religious policy i can absolutely blame people who continually choose and initiate violence no matter what has happened before oh and as far as what they ’ve dealt with since 1948 arab countries have repeatedly initiated war with israel which has successfully defended itself terrorists have continuously attacked israel and murdered israeli citizens israel has continuously offered peace and ceasefires and multiple two state solutions all rejected or broken by arab countries palestinians because they do not want peace they want only the extermination of jews and the destruction of israel i can blame them for that too
you are referring to the people kicked out of every mideastern country because the try to overthrow every country that lets them in right
that 's not the point biden can say he is in favor of a two state solution but his actions says otherwise at the rate we are going there will be no state and biden has to be aware of it not in gaza or the west bank we 're only deciding how many will be dead by the end of it
it requires a truly breathtaking lack of self awareness to claim that jewish nationalism is equivalent to nazism but palestinian nationalism is peaceful and progressive y'all literally condemn jewish nationalism as nazism while simultaneously waving the palestinian nationalist flag
democrats are a big business party just packaged differently
hi i 'm an extreme leftist and we are n't the ones demanding cult like devotion to biden most of us are not even planning on voting for biden please do n't confuse the u s 's incredibly right shifted overton window for an actual left right divide it 's mostly the center right vs the far right
if you believe in that nonsense you ca n't be taken seriously sorry extreme leftists are not calling for dismantle of worker rights child rights human rights in fact quite the opposite we want to implement strongest polices regarding this issues extreme hell not even extreme right wings are openly calling for all of it to be dismantled and the rights cease to exist
not the same trump was allowed to crack the door because he embraced fascism and racism literally the same thing that happened in the weimar republic “ ohh do n’t worry his ideas are scary but he has a lot of engaged followers ” is probably what they said in 1933 and in 2016
i ’m glad you ’re reading my comments now you have my attention and i ’m giving you the space to offer actual real life thought out intelligent answers only saying he should “ step aside ” without anything to support it is not very smart and is the reason people are criticizing your camp
if biden loses it ’s on the liberals and the dnc for having a closed primary and putting forth a candidate people do n’t like
or joe should be coached better to deal with shitting pigeons
we 're not allowed to demand better from our current president because of trump this genocide has been going on for nearly a year and anytime i say that we should stop supporting it all anyone can respond with is what about trump trump trump trump that 's all this fucking subreddit talks about i do n't give a fuck about trump i do n't give a fuck about the election i just want my country to stop murdering innocent people how is that such a controversial take i feel like i 'm taking crazy pills listening to some of you how are you not outraged at the evil we 've been forced into supporting
short term no but they are doing incalculable damage to themselves long term 80 year olds like trump and biden and old us jews back israel 100 % but the younger people including many young us jews are revolted with what they see
allowing israel to annex the west bank is terrible its like russia annexing dpr and lpr annexing a territory illegally and undemocratically itself is terrible let alone a territory where the majority of inhabitants vehemently oppose israeli occupation an israeli annexation of the west bank would require ethnic cleansing or genocide or apartheid or they could give the palestinians equal rights to an israeli citizen but that would defeat the whole point of zionism so for zionists the three former options are more preferable
given the number of zionists in both parties that does not shock me
do you have a proposal of how to actually fix this issue other than allowing terrorists to role play as governments but the palestinians have to negotiate with likud and its coalition partners
because the civilized world wants to help israel defend themselves from terrorist attacks why would they use it lol
i read a conspiracy theory about how actually the jews do control the entire government and that 's sufficient evidence for me that they do this is public record stuff aipac accounts for less than 3 % of campaign spending that is a fact we can verify it they account for an even smaller percentage of lobbying spending
a dem politician that loses an election is just going to go have another career and be nice and wealthy you are n’t punishing them you ’re just going to be getting none of the policies that you want instead of a portion of the policies you want
yep millenarianism from people who do n’t know what millenarianism is particularly that given how often such doomsayers have predicted that this event or that moral panic is going to end the world at least one thing is pretty clear “ the fuckers were n’t close ” lewis black
i do n’t know who you know in gaza or what relatives you have there but mine without a doubt recognize trump would be way worse for their situations between the two heck the odds of refugees and the diplomacy involved in that etc with rest of the world to say nothing for trump and the gop even suggesting using mules in gaza but yea time to make a symbolic gesture
my choice is to keep foreign governments from having such a huge voice in american politics then why do you want to put a russian puppet in the white house
he referenced that hamas is still in rafah and israel should finish the job of eliminating hamas he said it after biden said the only one who wants to keep the war going is hamas this could be read in so many ways it 's stupid to assume he meant that finish the job means genocide just like it 's stupid to assume that when someone says the final solution he must mean a holocaust i do n't like trump but it 's stupid to insinuate he was saying a genocide should occur
uh the gop ’s project 2025 will completely undo democracy and destroy agencies like the atf fbi and cia and replace imprison people in places of govt and replace them with loyalists bidens administration won’t do that if that ’s not enough for you alone you really have n’t truly considered what happens when democracies collapse to right wing authoritarian control if it were up to me we ’d just be pulling out of israel and yes its horrible and i think all religious wars are inherently selfish stupid delusional bullshit that america needs to stand above and never participate in seperation of church and state sadly biden misread the room and thought being a valiant “ zionist ” was a good thing stupid and selfish i agree i m going to tell you this though between defending my family first or people across the world i ’m choosing the smartest decision maybe you disagree with my mindset but i m hoping we can get america back on a path of 1 getting nato in check and have them take the lead for a while while the us sorts itself out and 2 dismantling the corrupt gop and hopefully someday we can expand to more than 2 parties to play back and forth with in the us to make sure some strongarm attempt like this does n’t happen again we need the guy who is pro democracy to be able to undo this shit the gop is trying to start and at the end of the day that means voting biden mainly for his administration as they wo n’t bow to the gop ’s demands dude can die first day in office and i ’m happy voting biden and his administration at this point because the alternative is trumps administration hellbent on forcing religious extremism on us all we ’d end up personally helping the zionists truly genocide palestinians you will see the hard way what final solutions look like and in a fck’d up roundabout way you personally would be complicit in allowing that to happen by not voting biden i do nt know what logical fallacies you have blocking these very real facts from your brains
try living here before thinking you can speak on our politics cus i bet i m just gon na feel and look like a jerk trying to tell a whole other country who to freakin vote for i know i do n’t like certain world leaders but i also have the sense to know i have so many internal factors that i m unaware of that only citizens will comprehend
you are the one that said that i just reversed it but you continue to not answer the question posed of why you are n't is it over a single issue is it that you think a candidate has to be perfectly everything you want becuase representing 330 million people is downright impossible to expect of any individual
children suffering for the terrible decisions of their parents is nothing new unfortunately
yeah i ’m really on the left wing fringe of politics here making the same observations as people like justin trudeau and cindy fucking mccain it ’s almost fucking july they ’ve made all of zero progress eradicating hamas but made sure to obliterate plenty of civilians aid workers journalists and american citizens if this is israel actually attempting to respond to a terrorist attack it ’s the most incompetent response in history save afghanistan and iraq
american civilians volunteer for the military all the time
you 're moving the goalposts to not answer the question even if some civilians were involved not all of them did after all so my question remains the same
has there been a poll since 10 7 has anyone asked the palestinians how they feel about it genuinely would like to see that cause if not “ the fact is the vast majority of gazans support oct 7th ” is bullshit you pulled straight from your ass and not actually fact
oh thanks ok i deleted my comment it was disingenuous then assad does n’t enjoy majority support with syrians but how accurate are these poles in gaza like what if they are like syrian elections also what are the underlying reasons for the support is n’t it more or less due to frustrations with oslo failing
israel has continuously offered peace and ceasefires and multiple two state solutions all rejected or broken by arab countries palestinians the israeli far right assassinated yitzhak rabin for offering peace the israeli far right have spent decades undermining the oslo accords and currently control the government are n't some of the governing parties continuations of the stern gang kahane and other terrorist groups the various arab governments and political parties are not the same as the palestinian people
collective blame yeah let 's go
most of us are not even planning on voting for biden so you support trump then because any leftist not voting for biden is essentially casting a vote for trump any reason you might have not to support biden trump will be ten times worse now is not the time to try and make a statement by not voting support the guy who actually has a shot at keeping trump out
your criticism ’ completely misses the mark of their argument and if you do n’t understand why people are saying he should step aside you ’ve been paying zero actual fucking attention to said argument probably why you think people are saying we should let trump win because of biden ’s poor performance ’ when absolutely nobody is saying that
so your plan is what exactly
they 're just defending themselves from terrorist attacks meanwhile they advance into other territories and kill hundreds of civilians each day this has been the deadliest conflict for journalists as well also israel 's fault what about those aid workers that they 've killed the deliberate starvation tactics i guess the civilized world as you say is just cool with genocide because this goes far beyond simple self defense
here is some more proper sources that you can verify yourself
the guardian is conspiracy theory now
what ’s gon na happen they ’ll take gaza they ’ll kill or expel or imprison people they ’re already doing that in the west bank gaza was only a matter of time practically the entire un considers what has been happening in the west bank for decades to be illegal who has stopped the illegal settlements who has helped so what makes you think anyone is going to help gaza whose leadership was the aggressor here not one country like i said this is n’t about palestinians anymore it ’s about sending a message to the dems to remove their lips from aipac ’s boots
it ’s not about the palestinians anymore it ’s about breaking aipac ’s hold on american politics they already have republicans in their pocket because of their apocalyptic prophecies that hold is too hard to break but maybe a little suffering with trump in office will wake up the democrats maybe this will finally remove the hold aipac and israel in general have on america name one other country that takes american aid begs for it then tells america to screw themselves name one other country that is arrogant enough to constantly anger other countries ’ presidents and still get whatever they want we will all suffer under trump but maybe that is necessary
well we only have the two choices and the plight of the palestinians is closer to me
at what point in the past 16 years has trump told the truth the same guy that blackmailed ukraine before russia invaded is who you think you can take at face value and interpret that he wo n't allow innocent palestinians to be further slaughtered hell he may even tell israel to back off and have our navy get involved directly or order them to attack iran directly it is wild that folks still somehow give the benefit of the doubt to that guy
this could be read in so many ways it 's stupid to assume he meant that finish the job means genocide just like it 's stupid to assume that when someone says the final solution he must mean a holocaust that 's kinda the point it 's a dog whistle it 's vague enough that you ca n't definitively say that he means genocide no sane person would advocate for genocide but trump is n't sane this dude tried to ban muslims from entering the country and he separated children from their families at the border it is not a stretch to think this racist asshole wants isreal to turn gaza into a crater
i 'll have my views just like us folk have their views on overseas countries and their politics
i 'm not voting for biden because he is center right and i 'm a communist i will be voting for a left wing candidate
i ’m being very clear that gaza has installed governing terrorism that is vastly supported by its people it ’s a welcomed government the discussion is never going to be grounded in reality until people start from that baseline over 80 % of gazans supported october 7th and virtually most supported hamas throughout the war this is n’t a normal war and gaza is n’t a normal place with respect to how modern governments protect their citizens and do n’t use them for military advantage so no it ’s very different from america and its citizen comparing the two is beyond outrageous
yeah none of it is the palestinians ' fault
literally nobody said that aipac does n't give money to politicians or do all of the things that any other pac does it 's a pac their entire job is to try to influence us politics we all know that but you 're claiming that aipac has some disproportionate amount of control over congress and that simply is n't true again they make up less than 3 % of campaign spending you can throw big numbers around all you want but that does n't change the fact that they are a drop in the bucket yet you and many others talking about them as if they have congress on literal puppet strings and that 's just straight up normal antisemitism there is no evidence for that supporting israel has been a central pillar of us policy for the last 80 years that 's why most us politicians support israel it 's not some conspiracy theory its the force of habit combined with the combined 80 years of investment in israel as an ally most politicians simply do n't want to abandon an ally we have had for as long as they have been alive when that ally is our only reliable ally in the region and has been well liked by americans in general until very very recently but people here love to focus on aipac and completely ignore the blatant racism of claiming that a group of jews literally control congress with money as the only reason we still support israel it 's a ludicrous idea
make sure to give us a smug wave from the train
it ’s not about the palestinians anymore ah ok i see where we disagree i do n't want them to all be killed by netanyahu so i 'm going to support whomever is n't trump you 've chosen your ideological battle over their lives you 're free to make that choice but it 's a grim one
let 's play a game replace aipac with jew in this comment and see if it sounds like something the nazis would say rereads the comment yeah that sounds like something right out of the elders of the protocols of zion seriously you need to reread what you wrote because it is not only counter to the facts but is actively peddling antisemitic conspiracies about jews controlling the government no it is n't okay just because you said aipac and now jews
it ’s not about the palestinians anymore so it 's not about palestinians anymore but their plight is close to you your points stink of contrarianism
you will and you ’ll get more flack too because you do n’t seem to notice just how crazy the gop ’s project 2025 is have a read if you have n’t already and come back and tell us how this means we should still not vote for biden
what happens when trump wins
and i 'm an incredibly left leaning liberal myself but not voting for biden when he already won by a scarily small margin last time is giving a vote to trump refusing to vote for a progressive centrist when all people with any conservative beliefs at all will be voting for the conservative that wants to take away all social systems and purely empower the wealthy elites is cutting off your nose to spite your face the electoral college system does not work in a way that your thinking benefits you or anyone in this country you will not get enough votes in the current climate under the system for your vote to even get an electoral vote and there is no way that system will ever change under the republican party as they regularly lose the popular vote but sure it you 'd like to throw a vote out into the void out of spite and allow for the conservatives to continue to empower wealthy elites then go ahead just its pretty shortsighted and in direct opposition on actual communist ideals
i 'm not voting for biden because he is center right and i 'm a communist i will be voting for a left wing candidate you 're voting equally for biden your center right example and trump the would be fascist dictator the candidate and party you 're voting for will not be relevant in any way no matter what you do in this next election presidential elections are not the vehicle by which you make a party relevant they already have to be you not voting for one of the two major party candidates that most closely aligns with your beliefs which is biden is very much akin to dropping a vote on your furthest opponent because you 're wasting your vote that might have opposed them
babe you 're not a communist you 're a tankie
well you can bring that self righteousness to the gulag with you if trump wins see how well it helps you then i do n't care about convincing you do what you want but you 're going to regret it if trump wins
again over half of people in gaza were n't even able to vote in that election that was never repeated afterwards do you think people living under a terrorist regime has the option to voice discontent every information from gaza that goes contrary to support of israel is false but saying people support them unconditionally is the one that is true then and what do you mean by a normal place do you think there are no ordinary people there do you think everyone of them is a culprit that deserves punishment it is not a comparison lad it is a simple question you are trying to move the conversation into some place it is n't because you are trying to dodge a simple question yes or no senator should innocent people children be held responsible what people in charge did or not are people in the us who was n't even born when us invaded iraq and afghanistan responsible for the lives destroyed by us government or not edit blocked me instead of answering the question how nice
over 50 % of gazans are under 15 that 80 % support is really easy to get when you brainwash a bunch of kids against the people dropping bombs on them and even if they did n’t support the terrorist regime are you gon na admit that while you still live under them how many cubans were going around yelling “ fuck castro he sucks ” not any of them that still lived in cuba and if they do n’t support hamas what choice do they have how are a bunch of under 15 year old kids gon na stop a terrorist regime
neither america or israel should exist both are genocidal fascist governments if i get beheaded for living in a fascist state so be it
waiting for homeboy to respond to this which i ’m sure he wo n’t
3 4 of the people living in gaza were n't even adults in 2006 all they 've known is an open air prison some child i watched in an interview before 7 oct was saying how she 's jealous of her cousin who has leukemia because she gets to get outside gaza when she goes for treatment these are extremely traumatized people you ca n't put the blame on them
i linked all my sources from reputable news organizations if you were genuine you ’d read them aipac is just the most well known there are plenty of others
i guess we will all have to deal with the consequences
when did biden do anything about palestinian lives except lip service how is he any different than trump trump will let netanyahu do whatever he wants biden does the same but with some “ no please do n’t ”
i guess the guardian haaretz and new york times are anti semites too
this is the problem you equate anti israel with anti jew this is exactly what new laws are trying to criminalize and i ’m not even anti israel i just do n’t want my tax dollars going to a country that does n’t respect what america is asking them to do they take our money then tell us to pound sand it has been happening since before clinton
they seem to think their single vote will turn the electoral college for a third party candidate that no one is talking about and not that it will be one less vote for biden in a very tight race making it easier for trump to get 4 more years of turning our laws and courts against what they claim they believe in
i mean this without offense but i do not trust your opinions on actual communist ideals when you describe yourself as an incredibly left leaning liberal a phrase which is an oxymoron to my ears due to liberalism being a fundamentally right wing ideology
supporting genocide does n't align at all with any leftist belief
you 're not a communist you 're a communist i dislike ok
wanna guess why 3 4 of the people living in gaza were n’t adults in 2006 try looking at what happened in 2007 after that birth control went bye bye
haley would sell her own grandma for another 15 minutes why should we care what she thinks
cognitive tests are genuinely the most basic form of are you capable of thought and we have a former president who wo n't shut up about passing it
political coward who bent over and begged the felon rapist fraudster and failed former president to be president again thinks she has something to say that is worthwhile i guess some people have no shame i feel sorry for her
it still wo n’t be you haley
i would vote for a parrot that only said do what you think best do what you think best bawak over trump
haley was never against trump she like the rest was hoping to at least set up a space for herself four years down the line and some cabinet position
even after the debate i would still put my vegas money on biden passing a cognitive tests more then his opponent
guess she got word she wo n’t be named his vp
i liked her for a republican until i saw she had no spine and changed her stance at the drop of a hat or being called a mean name by trump
biden has a long political history in spite of his “ ” apparent “ ” deficiencies he can use that knowledge with good advisors to best effect frankly much of government is delegated so i vote brains over an ahem stupid
i hope aoc runs in 2028
haley would empty trump 's diaper on her face if he told her to do so
i want to sign a 15 week ban of hearing from nikki haley into law
who cares what that booty licker says
haley the fucking coward and traitor to the constitution haley
seeing democratic blood in the water ever the opportunist nicki tries to throw her party 's candidate over the bridge after she endorsed him her ambition totally eclipses her competence
i really do n’t like her
people initially gave her a pass when she called trump unfit to be president her reversal on this stunned many however her previous positions on issues were pretty sus imo she has joined the cruz rubio trump sycophants club ugh
i mean i ’m happy to see anyone needle trump
she 'll be wrong cruz will be wrong on michelle obama as will ramaswamy etc it 's all red meat for the base naturally
trump brags about passing a test that any random person walking down the street should pass easily and he says it like we should be impressed it 's like bragging that you can tie your own shoes sadly i do n't debate that both trump and biden would struggle with a basic cognitive test trump 's test was given by his own doctor and that was years ago so i do n't even trust those results trump also says at 6'3 his current weight is 215 i would literally bet my home that is not true he 's got ta be pushing 300
i do n’t she ’s an asshole
unfortunately what most of the country thinks is “ best ” is to openly expose their ignorance and bigotry
and democrats say republicans are tribal yikes
correct or to inherit his base she and desantis lost their window in primary ing trump herr abbott otoh played his hand brilliantly and is still playing it well if he thought trump had it in the bag he 'd lunge at the opportunity but he declined for a reason when asked to be his vp
all of the armchair diagnoses of cognitive fitness based on the debate performance are infuriating like there 's a reason why psychologists do n't test for cognitive fitness by asking patients to explain complex subjects on a stage in makeup while dealing with a yammering compulsively lying narcissist who 's trying to actively gish gallop on twelve different topics was biden 's debate performance good no it was not it was in fact catastrophic and a president should be able to do that better than he did but there 's a hell of a gulf between the debate performance and the claims people are making about what it means about his mental fitness like watch his raleigh speech given the very next day nobody in the state of mental decay that his biggest critics are implying he is in could have given it
tests more than his opponent
cognitive test can mean all kinds of things though if you 're measuring how much someone loses their train of thought and ca n't find the correct words biden is fucked if you measure dark triad traits trump is fucked
you mean you ’re voting for the guy with brain damage
i do n't a presidential win would end her political career she needs to he a senator for a bit make a difference i wish obama had more time to shape policy
it 's gon na be whitmer vs newsom in the primary in 28
she ’s too valuable in congress right now maybe in the 40s
anyone who was ' stunned ' by her flip flop has n't been paying attention
do n’t lump romney in with that group he has completely parted from trump and has been increasingly disillusioned with the republican party probably the only republican i have a little bit of respect for today
she was always in that club the beltway made her seem like a man in love with a woman to the point where they were infatuated with what they wanted to see not what was there all along haley has always been who she is the media made her something she never was otoh
well no wonder trump thinks it ’s impressive as i highly doubt he can tie his own shoes not that he does n’t know how to tie shoes just that he ’s incapable of bending and probably has n’t seen his feet in decades
he is at least 350 source am less fat than trump and am over 300
he 's probably not really 6'3 either
president parrot would be talking to career staff i trust their judgment
unfortunately voting for biden is basically voting for a parrot biden ’s brain damage has become so obvious now that a parrot might even have more intelligence yes he has brain damage from multiple aneurysms if you actually follow the science of brain damage its makes a lot more sense
i think trump will do more damage then a brainless bird i d vote for a republican who was an actually republican but they got purged
there is n’t actually a parrot to vote for they there is actually a cult that supports trump yikes
i highly doubt any of you have had a legitimate cognitive evaluation from a neuropsychologist and these comments make it obvious i ’ve been through 4 different neuropsych evaluations the full evaluation takes around 8 hours and every part of your brain is evaluated through all kinds of different test there is no way biden could possibly get halfway through a real evaluation at his age and a brain with as much damage as his there ’s one test that would instantly prove what i ’m saying those puzzles for kids that has a board with shapes and you put shapes in the proper spot they blindfold the test subject and put one of those boards in front of you there is no way biden could do it with his memory issues i ’ve do n’t it four times and never got through it a damaged brain struggles too much to process the puzzle without actually seeing it who knows if trump would be able to do it but it ’s a lot easier to do when you do n’t have brain damage
nope i’mnon us but the alternative of a finding a replacement and b convincing an electorate it ’s all good to my mind is a bigger risk and as for tfg clearly brain damaged to the cliff edge of madness so i know what i would do if it were possible
hannibal lecter and revolutionary war airports
i do n't think he is voting for trump
trump 's brain is damaged in an entirely different way that is far more dangerous you should watch unfit on amazon everyone should watch unfit on amazon lol it 's remarkable just how messed up the man is imo biden should be replaced but if he 's not he 'd still defer to his cabinet and advisors that 's the bigger picture trump defers to no one but trump and people like that should never be allowed near power his narcissism is pathological and dangerous and going off personal experience in my own family i think they 're both suffering from cognitive impairment biden has the muted grasping for words kind of early dementia like my grandfather had trump has the angry shouty repetitive phrases kind of early dementia like my grandma had both candidates should be on the golf course instead of in the white house but this is america so we 'd all better be ready to eat a shit sandwich
obama technically did n’t need to retire
right they ignored so much data about her character
i 'll remove him once in a while he does the right thing
trump sees his feet all the time he always has a mirror nearby so that he can admire his beauty
i 'm 360 and a few inches shorter than trump he makes me look slightly overweight
you seem to be misunderstanding the point voting for a parrot is preferrable to voting for trump like that 's not hyperbolic voting for a rock with glitter sparkles on it is preferrable to voting for trump heck voting for a rock that does n't have glitter sparkles on it is preferrable to voting for trump again none of that is hyperbolic voting for a person who does not believe in the peaceful transfer of power has malicious intent and does not believe in the rule of law will always be the greater of two evils biden could be the most mentally deficient person in the history of our nation and scores of us would still vote for him over trump because at least with biden we know that at the end of four years we are guaranteed to still have a democracy where our votes matter with trump that is not a certainty and that is the most disqualifying factor that there will ever be for the office of the presidency
democrats are equally cultish oc ’s comment is just further proof
not just her every republican who talked shit then rolled over once they realized their specific brand of assholery was n't gon na sell this round
they ’re not equally cultish unifying democrats has been a lot more difficult than unifying republicans do republicans even have any criticism of trump how do you think they felt about his performance at the debate perfect right
oh you feel better now everyones in a cult too
you 're in a cult because you refuse to be part of our cult
more likely they knew they would be on the list of people on the chopping block of the federal government when he is re elected
yes me being critical of joe means i love trump democrats inability to grasp nuance never ceases to amaze me
you sound so pressed the truth hit a little too close to home i guess
a lot of democrats are critical of biden that ’s my point when you say the democrats are cult like where ’s your proof
no one said you love trump get over your victim complex
you sound so resigned the truth just needed some sweetener
“ i would vote for a literal animal over a republican ” right there
ah yes the people who are in their feelings are accusing others of being emotional classic projection
animals are n't actively trying to take my rights away
actually the real quote is i would vote for a parrot that only said do what you think best do what you think best bawak over trump i know reading can be hard especially for those from stereotypically stupid states
must be hard to go outside when everyone is out to get you
you know what a paraphrased quote is right are parrots animals i know it ’s tough for you to comprehend words so let me walk you through it here for any questions you have we ’re going to get through this together
i mean litchman has been right every time except 2000 which was a year the sc told people to stop counting votes so bush can just win litchmans model is leaning biden
alan lichtman has gotten every presidential election prediction right going back 5 decades except the controversial bush gore which was not decided by counting all the votes but a 1x not precedent choice by the supreme court he correctly predicted trump 's election and his subsequent defeat in 2020 2 very close elections i watched mr lichtman 's post debate podcast where he acknowledge biden performed very poorly but his main point was that debates have very little ability to move the electorate in a predictive manner and as a historian he gave multiple examples of candidates mopping the floor with their opponent and losing and vice versa a candidate losing the debate s and then still winning the presidency
for those unsure why this particular historian is being sought for interview according to cnn historian allan lichtman who has successfully predicted past presidential election winners based on key characteristics for those who may want to dive a bit deeper or are interested in his technique
it ’s worth noting that debate performance is not one of the 13 keys to the white house
i ’m voting for biden did he look bad at the debate yes does that mean i ’m going to let a convicted felon and rapist lock brown children in cages again destroy the supreme court and strip women of their rights give bibi the green light to level gaza and be completely negligent and even pernicious when handling a national catastrophe fuck no and that s not even a complete list of the damage we ’re still uncovering landmines and neglect from trumps term if you ’re going to stay home because biden did n’t do enough to give you the “ perfect vibe ” to vote for him maybe it ’s because you live in a entitled bubble where the reality of a second trump term wo n’t affect you have the understanding to reflect on your own privilege check it
well duh it seems like a good idea to people who do n't realize that changing a candidate a few months before an election will just make it look even more like they are disorganized and do n't have a firm grip on the election not like anyone they try to put up will be instantly popular just know biden is better then trump for literally the entire world except russia
one of the situations where i actually agree with lichtman i 'm not sure there 's even a modern equivalent since this kind of thing is what inspired the modern presidential primary era mcgovern et al i do n't think the people pulling for this quite grasp what kind of situation they 're proposing even with biden 's active support it would be a mess and one that might carry an electoral penalty just on its own on top of the other potential ones depending on what happened
this generation of 70 and 80 somethings seem more desperate to claw on to power than any other previous group and they ’re lashing out now that they ’re finally beginning to see it slip away
i wonder if this historian would also say there 's no chance a convicted felon who tried to overturn the last election and is openly planning on turning the government into his authoritarian regime is going to win because it 's never happened before yet that convicted felon is marginally leading in the polls it 's a different time and requires different strategy
just like stocks prediction models work until they do n’t do we think this is a normal election
way too late now i also doubt there would be any enthusiasm among democrats with serious presidential ambitions to replace biden newsom would not want to be parachuted in like this or whitmer they would prefer to wait 4 year to launch their own bids untangled from what would be a disasterous biden pullout there is no way biden gets replaced
dreaming that biden will be replaced is one thing but anyone seriously proposing it is either pro republican pro russia or just naive about republicans tactics republicans are pushing this idea because it opens the door to challenge the new candidate on every state ballot as some republicans have already indicated they would as gore bush garland and jan 6 show precedent does n’t matter republicans need the failsafe of a legal claim to push any loss to the supreme court replacing biden is a great idea if you ’d like to know this particular court ’s opinion on what the founders “ probably ” intended in this situation hint this court believes the founders were og republicans
biden had a bad night no need to kick him out
and replace him with who exactly and who would ruin their chances of being the democrat nominee in 2028 by trying to right a sinking ship in less than 4 months x200b exactly no one x200b biden and the dnc should 've groomed a replacement probably harris before the election in case something like this happened but as it stands it would be very risky to promote a new candidate in less than 4 months the dnc should 've known that something like this looking half dead and senile on stage could happen
biden is n't going anywhere switching candidates makes no strategic sense
have there been debates before the conventions before i honestly ca n’t remember the candidate is traditionally chosen during the conventions what ’s with everybody acting like the election is next week or that it ’s going to be won or lost this early in the game
and replace joe with who democrats do n't have a strong viable candidate and if they split the blue vote they hand the election over to trump and besides it 's far to late into the election cycle democrats need to realize this and votebiden
i do n’t give a shit about the debate no fucking way i would stay away from the polls or ever vote r again i support joe and every democrat no matter what republicans have lost their moral compass
this is a nice dose of reality from an expert with a proven track record
anyone american under the age of forty is perfectly used to being told their beliefs and convictions are nonsense by the generation that refuses to relinquish their power
anyone citing history has n’t been paying attention everything about the last decade has been unprecedented
a convicted felon is is campaigning on putting ten million people in cages and biden has to drop out because he had one bad performance like who in their right mind writes a comment perpetuating this insane double standard
the debates may not be a key to winning the presidency but having a moment that just makes a candidate look terrible is a key to losing except for trump biden is n't teflon like trump
a good strategic move will be to promise vp harris the attorney general role in the next administration a position i think she prefers anyway i would then put california governor newsom as vp on the ticket he will inject a high level of youthful energy and knowledge to the ticket it will counter the subtlety racist argument that a vote for biden is a vote for kamela as president newsom will be president in future anyway without this move but this will speed it up
it 's too fucking late suck it up and vote realize that this is why some of us preferred bernie just vote and make sure next go around we 're not at the mercy of the moderate wing they 're leading the party down the path of obsolescence you ca n't energize the base when you serve them vanilla all the time the 2 times we got a new flavor we blew their doors off at the polls the party is going to destroy itself just in a less catastrophic manner than republicans
the nytimes editorial board can go fuck itself btw what an insane take
all this sounds good until biden loses to trump and then we wonder what we were thinking by not replacing him it 's easy to talk down on people now history will tell
in the 1920 election the republican establishment were planning to have teddy roosevelt run again unfortunately he died before the convention what happened was a raucous convention where warren harding emerged and while a terrible president he did go onto win the election these things used to be decided at the convention and candidates who could and did win would emerge from the process yes the world is very different than it was a century ago but it is a process that used to work and this is a contest with democracy on the line where biden was already trailing in most battleground states because people blame him for inflation after that debate and his bragging about beating medicare most swing voters many of whom inform themselves about politics with sound bites and social media clips will think he 's unfit for the job it 's worth taking a gamble and doing things how they used to be done we ca n't evaluate this like a normal election for one we 've never had a candidate have their mental capacity come so starkly into question before also this is the first time in living memory the challenger is a former president so we ca n't assume the usual rules of incumbency will apply when the challenger is the president 's immediate predecessor in the office the last time a former president ran teddy roosevelt put in the best third party showing in our nation 's history and actually did better than the incumbent taft the time before that grover cleveland won getting his revenge on benjamin harrison in both cases the former president 's successor turned out to be unpopular and the former president probably smelled blood in the water this same situation seems to be playing out again instead of backing the modern day taft harrison in biden why not try to shake up the narrative we have nothing to lose at this point because barring a major october surprise we 're going to lose this election with our current candidate
of course cnn would say this it 's owned by the far right and has been for years now
the guy 's never been wrong before unlike all other pollsters so i 'll give him the benefit of the doubt still biden was rough it 's certainly something worth considering
reddit has been in panic since the debate
watch what the dp 's big money donors do they 'll be the ultimate decision makers as to whether biden stays or goes
nate silver had trump at 65 % to win before the debate according to him this is not a coin toss hope everyone likes trump because biden is n’t dropping out and biden is n’t winning
i think it 's genuinely strange that anybody thinks biden could be replaced at this point in time by anyone not named kamala harris
we can replace biden now or trump can replace him in november
after eight years of unprecedented bullshit i find it hard to care about precedent
those are russian democrats not american democrats
hehe cenk from youngturks must be really piss now he is so excited at the possibility of replacing biden so hype he even said now there is 85 % 90 % of its would happen but in the last 12 hours it seems like the biden people are fighting back and looks like its working more and more statement of supports from other democrats more and more media coming back to do propaganda for biden and more and more pro biden supports in social media looks like biden is the candidate
do n't believe your lying eyes and ears people
his model is going to break so hard this november lol you do n't come back from being this unpopular and such a poor performance as president and at the debate he says biden has a great economy but never brings up inflation give me a break
i mean a guy who would use the phrase “ foolhardy nonsense ” seems pretty much like the caricature of someone who thinks biden is a spry 81
they are not doctors they have no idea if biden is physic capable of carrying out a second term ” is someone going to tell him most of the american public are n’t doctors either or that you do n’t need to be a doctor to see elder abuse on live tv
you mean a bunch of terminally online brainrotted political know it all ’s might have miscalculated
biden is far from being comparable to ronald reagan in 1984 as a candidate additionally in the rightwing the backstory to reagan 's running for a second term has ron and nancy sitting on their sofa and watching the news announce he was seeking reelection because ghwb arranged for the announcement to go live a fact some democratic voters might not know the guy who shot reagan was a bush family friend maybe harrison should call for a snap national primary in say 30 45 days
“ fool hearty nonsense “ is the most old white guy sounding exclamation i can think of
i wish that the establishment would have had the guts to replace him a year ago tragic
biden could conserve one of litchman 's keys by forbidding israel from starting a war with hezbollah in lebanon for starters
i 'd like to ask lichtman this question has anything like this ever happened before have we ever had a candidate that most people believed had dementia who continued to run and won i could be wrong but this seems utterly unique and not prone to historic analysis if its never happened before
he was n’t the right candidate to begin with it was obvious from the beginning his age was a factor
am i the only one thinking biden just played trump i mean america does love a great comeback story and biden ’s “ get back up speech ” well played
i wonder whether sunk cost fallacy ’ comes into play though there ’s no indication biden ’s would agree to stepping down anyway
instead let 's just slow waltz into another trump term because we refuse to accept the reality in front of us
i ’m surprised that biden is walking without a walker but completely and utterly stunned that this is the nominee for president maybe they can try hillary again why not people are saying they ’d vote for anyone besides the other guy raise your hand if you actually sincerely wanted to vote for biden last time around nobody wanted him but this is where we are at maybe with an actual person and not a bag full of marbles the trump guy would n’t even have stood a chance no third party option is why we are here we are sheep
this idiot ’s opinion is foolhardy nonsense time to move on from biden it ’s joever
they ’re really pushing biden down our throats every post is saying how biden is our only hope the guy ca n’t even string together sentences hope we get a better option
neither of these men are fit for the job trump was lying and talking crazy you know doing trump things example they are doing abortions after the baby is born no one mentions it much because he ’s always been this way besides trump is a flat out criminal biden looked sickly and feeble he ’s always been older but he usually looks like he ’s spry for an old guy he did n’t that day he was hard to understand and hard to hear at first he was not making sense it looks like dementia he had a bad night he did not look coherent at times he does n’t look like he has 4 years in him and if he does they do n’t look like 4 strong years
replacing biden needs to be a serious option right now beating trump is our primary issue and after that disaster of a performance the risk of continuing on with biden may be higher than switching candidates we have a perfect off ramp right now ahead of the dnc
this motherfucker is as ancient as biden this election has no historical precedent so his opinions mean about as much as the dust in the wind he 's about to be fuck these has been trapped in the past planet wrecking motherfuckers just fucking go to one of your 15 summer homes and fuck off the rest of us are just trying to barely keep a roof over our heads and feed our families you motherfuckers have ruined everything by doubling down over and over again on being wrong and selfish can you just enjoy the riches you reaped at everyone who came after you 's expense and get the fuck out of the public sphere already seriously fuck off asshole
common sense also says biden but that sense of dread that we 've all rightfully developed tells us that good things rarely happen
you ’re talking about the guy who said clinton was going to win right up until it became painfully obvious that she would n’t
i do think sympathy votes are a thing
allan lichtman a professor of history at american university in washington d c has made a name for himself through one unusual talent he has correctly predicted the outcome of nine elections out of the ten most recent presidential races using a model he invented known as the 13 keys may 8 2024 using this model lichtman has accurately predicted the winner of every u s presidential election since 1984 with the exception of 2000 although he did forecast successfully that al gore would win the popular vote that year and 2016 where he predicted donald trump would win despite trump 's popular vote loss
i can respect that lichtman has some good insight and perfect track record in predictions however his system was created in early 80s it does not take into account social media and the rise things like short clips and memes
lichtman ’s own keys would mark the debate as a major scandal and biden as not being charismatic trump is in charismatic but that depends on the voter he ’s very charismatic to 50 % of the country incumbent party does n’t have a mandate the economy questions are a matter of socioeconomic or political viewpoint if you ’re in the lower economy you ’re doing poorly if you ’re in the stock market you ’re doing well lichtman ’s keys have kind of been hacked by the propaganda and split worldview if method is doing but he ’s interpreting his own keys wrong
yeah it ’s not the debate breh it ’s the fact that biden is old af the debate just confirmed everyone ’s fears that he ’s just tooo old usually i ’d agree but this might be the first time it actually does matter
99 9999 % of people in this sub are voting for biden biden needs 50 000 people to turnout in 3 of the 6 swing states the people in the office who say they do n’t care about politics they are n’t reading this they ’re being told trump is a threat to democracy while biden can only put together a sentence 10 % of the time if he ’s not reading a teleprompter it ’s an insult and unforgivable
thank you doomers in these political threads seem to think you 're only voting for one person you 're voting for everything attached to that one person 45 winning in 2016 brought a wave of societal changes that will continue to make waves people do n't realize the scotus is the way it is because of 45 they 're ignoring the hundreds of congress seats that are up for grabs i 'm not staying home i have no bubble project 2025 should never happen
we all know he 's just going to grift whatever he can and just shrug and hand all actual policy decisions to stephen miller as long as it does n't interfere with the top bidder
you ’re preaching to the choir here the democrats including myself who want to replace biden are not saying that we ’re going to vote for trump we ’re not saying that we ’re going to stay home we ’re saying that we have to convince the slim margin of swing voters who might stay home write in a third party or even vote for trump to vote for the democrat on the ticket and those swing voters who might not pay that much attention to politics regularly to begin with just saw someone put up on that stage who seemed lost and unable to complete a thought why are we locked in with biden here what is it about biden in particular where you do n’t think someone like gretchen whitmer or josh shapiro can win are we really forced to go to november with a guy who looks to be suffering cognitive decline just because it ’s time to get creative here
it 's not privilege or doomerism to want democrats to do the right thing and replace biden as the nominee i and most dem leaning voters i know are still voting for biden but to act so defensive and aggressive when people want to address the methuselah aged elephant in the room is almost as destructive to american democracy as anything else we ca n't just allow the system to force these dipshits on us and be cool with it again will i vote biden fuck yeah i 'd vote for a chimp with syphilis before voting for trump that does n't mean we ca n't expect better from our institutions though
dems are n't fighting trump they are fighting voter apathy
try shoving the polls in front of people whitmer is behind trump in all of them biden is not newsom is behind trump in all of them biden is not harris polls worse than biden against trump as well what is the logical conclusion dc pundits wanting to dc it up not going over well with anyone but sheep imo
has there ever been a major election in any first world country where pulling their leading candidate the incumbent too a few months before an election has actually worked a lot of time and money has been spent on biden ’s re election already
biden is only better if he wins he is only going to get worse he ca n't win over swing voters when he ca n't form a coherent sentence democrats have to bite the bullet and make a decision to replace him right now otherwise the world is fucked not just the usa
and north korea saudi arabia iran china
why would swing voters deduct points away from dems for looking disorganized and not having a firm grip but not deduct points from the gop for looking orders of magnitude more inept all the time
who cares when you see him frail and incapable on national tv and a million times over in snippets shared on social media biden is done trump won you all screwed up so massively the whole world will look back at the dems and their supporters and wonder how you could screw up so so badly
you guys we must vote for the incompetent senile old man remember all those videos of him being a slackjawed dementia riddled idiot are all “ cheap fakes ” and the media has never lied about anything including russia do n’t worry about your cost of living or the tyrannical exercise of power by bureaucrats that do n’t follow their own rules that s for plebs what you need to worry about is going to direct war with the largest nuclear arsenal on earth remember the majnstream media loves you and wants to protect you from covid which we will all die of immediately
biden is carrying an electoral penalty with him already people who are like “ well it would be harder to get a new candidate than just keep biden ” forget that all this has already happened publicly the whole country knows that biden had a god awful debate and that for the 24 hours following it many members of his own party do n’t think he should run he ’s damaged goods rolling the dice with another candidate is a better idea and it should be noted polls show voters are hungry for someone who is not trump or biden
i fear that it may be just as much of a mess if biden continues on the path he showed at the debate both options will carry a penalty i 'm not sure if either of them gets us across the finish line in november
there is no path forward without risk there needs to be a paradigm shift in this election biden will not provide it great president but he ca n’t campaign anymore he is behind we need a change
trump will win and turn this country into a fascist country and destroy our ability to vote and removing the will of the people we need to beat him to do that we need to replace biden by invalidating all the votes from the primaries and uh removing the will of the people
generation me had the world given to them on a silver platter and they can not fathom not being in control anymore
old liberals are losing power old conservatives are consolidating it the right has made enormous power grabs while liberals bicker about generational divides
80 % of biden pelosi clyburn and durbin 's generation is dead biden has lived nearly a decade longer than other males born in 1942 who have higher end healthcare
because that generation votes no matter what unlike young people who need to be inspired to vote
it ’s ironic that one of the most popular ways to be bad faith is to just accuse others of bad faith it is n’t like “ you should n’t swap your candidate 4 months before an election when you do n’t even know who with ” is some mindboggling absurd idea that can only be explained by his part in a generational conspiracy but also redditors disagree so i guess maybe he ’s the fool this is why this site ’s got a reputation for smug self satisfaction
the vast majority of men and women over 70 that i know strongly feel that trump is an asshat and would never vote for him on the other hand quite a few of my 50 something friends are huge trumpers
cool so who would be a good alternate 5 months prior to the election whitmer or shapiro do they have national name id like literally what are the options as a opposed to whining and crying
and the convicted felon is objectively leading all the beltway suggested fawned over candidates by more and wider margins so the smart thing to do is to risk 4 months out from an election further fracturing the dem base with wish lists of dc pundits that the country is objectively ready to reject happily more soundly lichtman might be wrong for sure but he might be right if you even want to put up a fight in november and have any chance of winning it 's got to be biden at this stage looking at all the polls of hypothetical they can win for sure oh oh no it 's just dc pundit wishful thinking sums it up
so when did you personally change your mind about biden after the debate or after years of observing biden
i agree the only people suggesting the dnc rip him off the ticket unilaterally are probably not democrats you 're right that would cause an avalanche of challenges the only way he gets replaced is if he steps down and the dnc could have a role in brokering that
i think they thought they could groom harris when the 2020 election was over but that went south i do n’t think she was a high pick before and it seems like nothing really happened to help that never got more popular with people probably worse especially with non democrats my honest opinion is that it needed to be someone like hakeem jeffreys but he needed to be the speaker way earlier however pelosi was busy fighting off the crazy gop in the house so she could n’t pass on the reigns to jeffreys too early and by the time he got in it was too late he ’s not obama who would come out of almost nowhere to challenge for a nomination so jeffreys needed some more institutional support to get him out front i still think jeffreys in 2028 is the play
the thing is no one who ’s interested in being president some time in the future would do this it ’s extremely risky bc if they lose to trump everyone wo n’t consider the situation they would just get all the blame a lot of people like to blame the dnc for everything but if biden does drop out which he ’s not going to do they would have a hard time finding someone to replace him anyway
i would happily crawl over broken glass to go vote for michelle obama there have been reports of a growing nostalgia for trump 's presidency misguided or not what would combat the nostalgia of trump 's first term among his voters than an even bigger nostalgia candidate for democratic voters if she ran i think she 'd win in a landslide joe would have to step down voluntarily of course the dnc making that call would look weak and panicked
newsom whitmer pete b biden needs to be replaced
you ’re right it ’s way too late for harris if it came to it and i do n’t think it ’s a good idea whitmer is probably their best chance she can galvanize woman on abortion and pretty much seals mi
put aside what has been said about him everyone should watch rfk jr ’s recent debate comments i do n’t know what changed but he ’s saying everything i want to hear post debate and the only one who polls show can win
neither does running a dying candidate this is elder abuse
the only thing that could be worse than that debate performance is replacing biden this late in the game if there were anyone who could replace him and win they would already be the obvious choice the fact that anyone has to ask who should replace biden is proof that it would never work
if his polling numbers do n't change much after this debate it proves the voters being polled are mostly locked in despite a very weak performance by biden but biden is still down going into this something needs to be done so if we know the voters are locked in then the game should be to get more turnout and stop worrying about the locked in voters historically without a doubt the age group with the most variable turnout is young people so why not pick a candidate shown to motivate younger people maybe the same candidate that got 2nd in the last primary and the one before that you get the upside of higher turnout with young people with little risk of losing your current voters after all if this debate wo n't make them jump ship nothing will
split the blue vote how if biden steps down and endorses everyone who was voting for biden will vote for that nominee does n't even matter who it is most biden votes are already not trump votes there is no splitting
michelle obama and before you say but she 's not remotely qualified you have to acknowledge that trump was even less qualified she would bring the base for sure the only question would be independents if you asked me before the debate i would have said biden may lose some independent votes due to the economic conditions it 's the economy stupid but now i fear independents will stay home in droves or vote 3rd party could mo do better with that block i think she could due to the nostalgia factor i think a lot of people would love to return to the pre trump days of imperfect but at least competent government you have to bring someone with charisma and she certainly has that i would go out on a limb and say that as good barack was she 's an even better speaker i really think she could do it if she put herself in the mix
the only person i ’ve ever been able to think of that could unify the democratic party and also pull strongly from independents and anti trump republicans is jon stewart zero other people everyone else offends the progressive wing or the corporate wing or does n’t have the minimum level of charisma required
split the vote what are you on about if biden steps aside the person chosen to replace him would be the nominee why would cling to joe biden so fervently of all politicians
i expect feinsteins corpse to be the next democrat presidential candidate
how so i thought their take was completely reasonable and correct
if you dump biden kamala harris is the new candidate you ca n't argue with a straight face that kamala harris has a better chance versus trump than joe biden does
looks like trump will be president then
he 'd lose a lot if jewish votea
reagan wilson and roosevelt come to mind as presidents who suffered severe physical or mental ailments running into their second campaign season
yes there is no advantage gained by generating a huge newscycle where even the mainstream dems are questioning your mental acuity and giving your opponent clips where you look like you should have your driver 's license taken away win or lose this is a five alarm fire
this is the dumbest shit i ’ve ever read on here
yes you are absolutely the only one jfc
yes you are kidding yourself if you think biden has a hope in hell of winning remember how confident everyone was that hillary was going to win in 2016 this time around will be much worse total apathy will guarantee trump a win everyone should be protesting outside the white house until he drops out if in doubt go back and watch that debate again it was fucking carnage
this idiot has never been wrong in his election predictions i would trust him over some random redditors some of which think aoc is a good candidate
alan lichtman is definately not an idiot he has gotten every presidential election prediction right going back 5 decades except the controversial bush gore which was not decided by counting all the votes but a 1x not precedent choice by the supreme court he correctly predicted trump 's election and his subsequent defeat in 2020 2 very close elections i watched mr lichtman 's post debate podcast where he acknowledge biden performed very poorly but his main point was that debates have very little ability to move the electorate in a predictive manner and as a historian he gave multiple examples of candidates mopping the floor with their opponent and losing and vice versa a candidate losing the debate s and then still winning the presidency
i mean apparently this dude has never ever been wrong when it comes to making election predictions and he clearly shows he knows how history and politics work take that as you will
ya i do n’t think i trust voters these days the misinformation spinning and massive right wing media machine has been doing work for 30 years
it would also be nice to not be in a “ common sense and models suggest a slight edge ” situation the democrats should be having a fucking slam dunk locked in win against trump at this point they had four years to have biden ready or assess he is n’t and have someone lined up
i do n’t know what to tell you his model seems to work well enough that ’s all this statement is about bud maybe fucking relax
maybe for a school board or other local election no one is casting a sympathy vote for president especially when the person they would be voting for looked completely unfit for the job
he was right about 2000 the supreme court was just still corrupt and voted to help out the person who gave some of them their seats over allowing the recount to continue
yea but the poeple who are watching short clips and memes barely vote at least historically maybe that changes in this election but i do n't see evidence that voter turnout amongst those who consume their news via social media actually go to the polls
and the unprecedented political landscape where roughly half if americans are willing to vote for someone who does n't even hide his dictatorial tendencies
i respect your right to question the accuracy of this person it does kind of come off like you 're saying it 's fake news cuz you do n't agree
you do n’t think he ’s updated it in 40 years
lichtman built these keys based on looking at each election from 1860 up until 1980 he states that these keys still apply as far back as 1860 retrospectively he 's said that every four years people tell him that he has to update his keys because obama is the first black candidate hillary is the first woman candidate biden is too old social media etc but he counters that his keys have retrospectively endured far greater changes civil war world war i and ii great depression as far back as when african americans and women could n't vote as far back as the horse and buggy days long before cars planes trains internet etc
and those people do n’t vote
he has a perfect track record but good lord
how does it account for an elderly incumbent who is barely lucid before you get mad at me i am fully prepared to crawl over broken glass to vote for joe biden ’s corpse if i have to i ’m just worried about his chances especially in swing states
idk it seems like the only thing americans want is a normal guy cheap gas and cheap fast food
trump is not charismatic to 50 % of the country maybe to his dedicated base which is at most 30 % but an equal amount ca n’t stand him at all
biden was n't considered charismatic in 2020 this does n't change that key and people have been saying that biden is old for months the debate is n't presenting new information it 's confirming what a lot of people already thought i have mixed feelings on the idea that did really bad in a debate counts as a scandal
lichtman literally does videos providing updates of his model look it up on his channel and he ’ll explain to you why you ’re wrong his last update at end of may had biden up 9 4 and no biden ’s debate performance is not “ a major scandal ” under his system
you have to actually read the criteria for what criteria is significant enough to turn a key true or false on lichtman 's most recent tentative outlook not yet a final prediction he has biden leading with 9 true keys to 4 false keys with a minimum of 8 true needed to predict his victory examples of charismatic candidates according to his model are t roosevelt fdr jfk reagan and obama in 2008 but not 2012 eisenhower 's status as a national hero is an alternate way to turn the charisma key true as well replacing biden makes the incumbency key false and creates a massive internal party struggle turning the no primary contest key false that puts him down to 7 keys and predicts a trump victory
people just hammer on the lesser of two evils and preventing trumps fascism and it ’s like those can be valid logical points and also true that just shouting them louder at unconvinced people is n’t effective
no they 'll implement project 2025 trump is in it to avoid prison project 2025 will destroy america as we know it
and that ’s fair i totally agree i only ask that people be aware of their actions and to have a plan “ replace joe ” is n’t a plan it ’s a complaint a detailed plan supported by facts has not been put forward thoughtlessly replacing the incumbent 4 months prior to an election only helps one person trump if people reflected on their own behavior even their own comment histories and compare that to the stream of trash coming out of the conservative subs they ’d look indistinguishable i only ask for thoughtfulness and facts
i mean i ’d argue that while it ’s nice to have a charismatic youthful president who makes us look young and muscular as a nation i honestly think biden ’s still got it from a mental perspective in other words biden being so old is very bad electorally but he ’s not fading in ways that make me especially worried about his actual performance of the off camera duties of the job then again i ’m someone who thinks the entire concept of office of the presidency needs to shift from “ here is our standard bearing temporary quasi king ” to “ here ’s our competent boring chief administrator of laws he works for us ”
bingo trump is driving turn out for both sides it ’s a matter of whether biden dampens the turn out for more apathetic voters
most people do n’t know the other potential candidates if there was a switch a media blitz would fix that
there has to be some kind of collective effort to push the joe must drop out narrative it worked pretty well people lost their damn minds yesterday and would just not listen to anyone who was n't freaking out saying the whole thing should be burned down nobody seems to have learned anything over the past decade the debate will be a blip on people 's memories long before the summer is over but it was like trump had won the election yesterday i am going to breakfast with my mom this morning to talk her down from her hysterics about it all nothing changed replacing biden would be a disaster and is exactly what the republicans would want the debate went about as should have been expected which makes me think all this tall about biden dropping out is part of their play hopefully people start to chill out and think clearly about all this because there is no chance biden is n't the candidate
i 'm sorry but what magical polls are you looking at where biden has more than a margin of error lead eta and surely you realize that those polling numbers did n't take into account what would happen with the full force of the dnc behind them and the 24 7 news cycle that would follow a candidate change biden 's pool numbers are relevant because they are reflective of the current situation those other numbers are not because they are n't even remotely close to the current situation
whoever it shifts too would instantly get a boost of media hype at their historically unique candidacy and underdog story it would show democrats are serious about what a threat trump is and that they hear the voters concerns
polls also show americans are desperate for a true alternative to trump or biden with the democrat ’s presumptive nominee saying in a national debate “ i ’m going to beat medicare ” we should probably roll the dice
all those polls have large undecided voters that do n't know those candidates it 's also been one day since this disaster it 's going to get even worse than it already is for biden
well dude you listed a bunch of people who have never run for president against a former president the point of a campaign is for people to get to know you across the country then those numbers rise we ’re in the middle of a campaign and trump has been campaigning where whittier or newsom have not of course polls in states they do n’t govern show them doing worse in a race the other person is running and they are not
just wait for the new polls to come out you surely do n’t think biden will get a boost after this debacle
we should absolutely be students of history when it comes to election strategy but there are a lot of factors to consider every election has some wild card that makes it different we need to stop with the “ well it has n’t happened before so it will never work ” line of thinking we ’ve never had a candidate this old who looked this frail where information and opinions moved so quickly against a threat this existential conventional wisdom should inform strategy not dictate it there ’s 100 % a way for a fresh underdog candidate to capitalize on social media and the 24 hour news cycle
impossible to deny he stumbled often but just as often he completed his sentence named policy named what he accomplished stated future goals trump just repeated what he always says rambling like a lune does n't show much mental difference between the 2
cool story bro rfk jr or jill stein will make that all go away in your mind i 'm sure
better then voting for the deranged criminal leader of a cult of half brained cow poo scoopers right oh and registered member of the wanna be a dictator club oh and publicly stated he will do nothing about the climate and leave any allied nation groups or simply refuse to help them oh and is an insurrectionist compared to him biden has good plans goals and most importantly is n't any of that stumbles when he speaks but so what
no one is saying biden did n't have a terrible debate performance and yeah if i had it my way it would be bernie but guess what the only person that won the dem primary was biden we need to rally and do the hard work of persuading others that he is better than the orange felon but i guess its more fun having an existential crisis on reddit and crying about it
the biggest issue with democrats is tossing out their own people regularly as damaged goods did republicans ditch trump after a bad debate night or after every one of a million scandals that democrats are so fickle and ready to toss their own to the wolves is a bigger issue than biden 's stumbling over words
no we do n’t democrats would be destroying their foundation if they changed horses now biden has already beaten trump once and delivered on key metrics a single bad debate against a con man who refused to answer questions about his attempted coup should n’t shock the democrats at the end of the day you beat this guy at the polls and stand strong as the party that represents democracy
makes you wonder what the average life expectancy would be in this country if everyone had 50 years of congressional health care
you mean like how it ’s always been
this is wrong the system is intentionally designed to make it easy for old people to vote and hard for young people to vote you ca n't blame young people they do n't know anything especially not how to vote in our asinine labyrinth of a voting system by the time they figure it out they 're not young people anymore that 's by design voting should be mandatory and easy
gen x and millenials are n't young anymore boomers and the silent generation need to pass the baton at least into gen x
i think having the election on a weekend day and not requiring them to take off work could really help that inspiration
this guy is mad that young people do n’t think political parties are inherently entitled to their votes
you do know that most of the time a party does not know who their candidate is this early before a convention right
name recognition or lack thereof is more of a benefit this late in the game they ’re a blank slate and importantly not trump or biden the democrats have nothing to lose and everything to gain by getting biden to drop out his approval rating is at 38 % even lower than trump he ’s not winning an election
if it ’s not harris then blacks will feel disenfranchised if it ’s not harris then funds raised other than superpacs have to be returned back it ’s harris or no change there is no other option that i see and harris is very unpopular democrats are sadly f ed
whining and crying you mean like establishment libs are always doing
it ’s weird all i ’ve heard on here for months is that the polls are n’t accurate because they show biden losing now suddenly they are very accurate because they apparently show biden losing by less than any other candidates
if biden keeps stumbling plans may need to be changed it was one debate move on of cheeto choked the repubs would ’ve been united behind him let it ride there is no obvious heir apparent if their was it would be different
she would face a formidable challenge considering that obama clinton and the other democrats potentional candidates like newsom and whitmer have already decided to circle the wagons in front of biden
is newsom even liked in his own state i always hear complaints from californians
cool now how are you going to sell that to harris
there is no poll anywhere showing rfk can win unless you remove either biden or trump gtfo here
rfk is an abject moron grifter with terrible ideas and opinions and thankfully no chance of getting elected
dude had a worm eat part of his brain i ’m genuinely concerned what he ’s saying that you actually want to hear
i mean as fucked up as it is neither candidate is a spring chicken both of these guys could drop dead any minute
trump will just run with it and say poor joe poor poor crooked joe they ran him over for insert infantile name here e g greedy gretch shady shapiro newscum newsom etc she he would n't be there without him believe me believe me they say they 're not the liars but i see a bunch of them tremendously
no change in an appreciable way the race is where it 's been since march 2023 ish so basically biden has to do a way better job at the only other debate for one thing despite less people obv going to watch that one to start
the party can select anybody technically we should have had a primary we should always have primaries every time
nope kamala would n’t win in a contested convention even democrats do n’t like her she dropped out of the dem primary in 20 before a single vote was cast but that ’s all moot b is n’t dropping out of the race
it was 1 5 percent when he took office and peaked in june 2022 wdym
he also does n’t have that power he is n’t president of israel
but those were covered up by the media this is out in the open now
yeah i guess that s a fair point in my opinion biden is looking a lot worse than reagan whatever the case behind the scenes but wilson and roosevelt did n't have to campaign on tv they basically managed to hide roosevelt 's issues from the public that 's not possible with biden
i would n't waste words on a bot you can identify them because they have a random username followed by a dash 4 digit number if you check their account they also have been here less than a month
i ’m saying his model is entirely subjective and it can not possibly reflect the current political climate where two halves of the country literally live in opposite worlds with different facts
he predicted that clinton would win after it became apparent that she would n’t win he pivoted
all they need it is to engage enough to get them to vote you ’re ignoring an entire swath of the population who get much news thru social media
they voted in 2016 and this system got that one wrong trump was very much a meme president
roughly 20 % 2020 saw 67 % voter engagement 33 % for trump 34 % for biden 33 % did n't bother that was before dobbs before 1 6 before book banning before ukraine before do n't say gay before project 2025 before trump was found liable for fraud and defamation before trump was convicted on 34 felony charges before trump fucked around with classified documents before facts came out about the fake electors scheme trump and the gop have gotten far far worse than they were in 2020
republicans are not going to vote for a democrat just because they are saddled with a bad choice in trump why is that hard to comprehend and for some of them trump is their middle finger to democrats it ’s not hard people
you do n't have to update principles you just incorporate new data
right but that ’s kind of the problem for his base they think he is a god among men and for his opponents he ’s the devil also he clearly has some measure of charisma he would not be a successful con man without it it should n’t be underestimated
compared to the biden we saw thursday night trump is the most charismatic person in the entire world
and people have been saying that biden is old for months years
this is something a lot of people need to hear everyone knew biden was to old this is n’t surprising
confirming 8 years of propaganda is a major deal if biden had shown up and been like he was in 2020 if he had been sharp and engaged it would have countered what people have been saying this is a “ see we were right ” moment but it ’s also a “ oh fuck they were right ” moment that is the problem
in two weeks the next big shit storm will land and people will wonder why people are still talking about the debate trump has felony convictions for literal fraud and he barely hurt his numbers people are n't suddenly goj g to support a felon because the other guy is old and surrounded by a talented group of advisors
he ’s vastly misjudging it early polling is pretty devastating
thank you for the insight
i agree with the sentiment that you 're talking about but i disagree that replace joe is just a complaint back in the 60s and prior it was commonplace for the parties to have open conventions with no clear nominee until the vote at the convention i know that we 're in a much different time but i do n't think it 's unreasonable to be optimistic that someone like whitmer newsome shapiro pritzker or my crazy thought mark cuban could pull something together and make their case before the convention any of the names i listed would have laid waste to trump at the debate and would do so moving forward i think they 'd also be able to inspire a confidence and hope that biden could n't even dream of so i agree with the basis of what you 're saying if biden 's the nominee then voting for him is 1000x better than trump but with respect to your opinion hoping for a replacement is more than just a complaint
it ’s maddening to me that we watched his poll numbers consistently sit below hillary ’s and then that truly disturbing debate performance and others are still seriously in favor of keeping him not only that but trying to gaslight us into thinking his performance actually was n’t that bad this party is doomed if we ca n’t even admit what ’s happening right in front of our faces
they could have picked one during the primaries they did n’t
how do you know it will get worse for biden i 'm not happy with yesterday 's performance he sucked and yes he 's old but he still has time to work the swing states and do what he 's good at which is plain ol' retail politics with voters i 'm just not buying that this is over
and they would likely pick the person they know over someone they do n't too we 're stuck with biden obv
i struggled making out most of what he was trying to say
i literally could n't understand what he was saying 50 % of the debate that 's not okay and it 's frankly insulting how so many folks are trying to handwave it away like i did n't see and hear it
both of them could n't stay on topic the difference is in the degree of control trump pivoted away from the questions to talk about what he wanted to talk about it 's idiotic but acting like that shows that you 're taking control and choosing what you want to say biden pivoted away from his strengths to bring up trump 's talking points he could n't stay on his own message that 's a problem for us
just as often he completed his sentence i beg of you to re read what you ’ve just written and realise that you ’re asking people to vote for this man to be president
it does n't matter if he completed some sentences and generally was correct in what he was saying it just comes down to the optics of him looking weak and confused more than once most people do n't pay much attention to the news and so will now only see those awful videos again and again and we ca n't just put this down to the tic toc attention span it 's been like that for decades it should have been so easy to look better than a convicted criminal and rapist but now whatever lies trump said will be disregarded as just his usual behaviour biden fucked this beyond repair
that was n’t a stumble he got lost in his own stories shut down multiple times mid sentence and just looked confused and disorientated most of the debate hell in the beginning even trump looked concerned for biden biden ’s health was so bad he actually gave a moment of humanity to trump i ’m just baffled at how this is being spun into just a “ stumble ” this was a campaign ending disaster there ’s no recovery for him at this point we can talk about trump ’s many faults all day but trumps base does n’t care to beat trump biden needs swing voters and after that debate most swing voters are sitting out or voting kennedy i supported hillary in 2016 both in the primary and general but i had my reservations when it just kept feeling like an uphill battle when it should have been the easiest campaign ever i went along with the democrats because they promised it was all fine despite what i was seeing i ’m not making that mistake in 2024 our only chance to win this is for biden to drop out this is based on his polling which has n’t changed and the very consistent way trump is underestimated in key swing states as it stood before that debate if trump has the same margin of error in his favor that he had in 2016 or 2020 he wins every state he won in 2016 plus nevada and even some “ safe ” states are dangerously close like minnesota the core reason for his loss of support is his and trumps age literally most swing voters just want someone who is n’t 75 years old that s literally all things about outside of their bases no one wants trump or biden so removing biden would be the wise thing to do the base will support whoever is on the ticket but the swing voters have repeatedly made their concerns heard
only joe biden can assuage my concerns because he is so mentally competent i just wish all these right wing conspiracists would stop taking videos of biden drooling slack jawed at a wall and making cheap fakes that make him look bad
oh trust i am not crying on account of joe biden have nt laughed that hard in a long time i hope the second debate goes through if you voted bernie then you understand there is no overlap with biden on policy so i do nt see why you would care if he loses
that answer assumes biden and trump are the same type of candidates that can be thought about as the same trump is who he has always been for better or worse biden is n’t and that ’s a problem the question should n’t be “ is it right or not for democrats to toss joe biden to the wolves ” it should be “ will tossing joe biden to the wolves give us a better chance of winning this election ” nothing else matters
the biggest issue with democrats is telling us “ you did n’t see what you saw ” from the debate and you want to say trump is a threat to democracy we are n’t allowed to be concerned what an insult
the biggest issue with democrats is the elder generation staying in their positions too long and costing the country dearly rbg feinstein and now biden
whoever it shifts too would instantly get a boost of media hype at their historically unique candidacy and underdog story it would show democrats are serious about what a threat trump is and that they hear the voters concerns the near universal refrain is “ i ca n’t believe it ’s these two guys ” “ bad ” does n’t cover it it was disastrous and confirms the number one concern voters have of him of course trump is a lying piece of garbage but the public believes biden is too old for the job and the debate drove that home we are marching into the end of democracy with biden and doing nothing because it ’s uncomfortable the current plan is n’t working and we have no reason to believe it will
except young people will spend hours a day posting bullshit about politics on social media and then not take the time to vote it ’s worse now
and that 's the problem i 've never needed to be inspired to vote for somebody i just want to know that you 're going to fix the problems we have and how your going to work to make a better country for the future and i want to hear how you 're going to do that
no boomers voted at a much higher rate in the 60s and 70s when they were younger and just kept doing it
we do n't vote for people to do them a favor we vote to influence the government 's actions you 're claiming that it 's a question of whether or not the democratic party deserves a favor that 's like saying you drive on a particular road as a favor to the asphalt rather than because you want to go to a particular place
this guy is mad that politicians do n't give a fuck about the opinions of people who do n't vote
it 's not about party entitlement it 's about voting for your own well being and the well being of others the people that refuse to vote due to self importance are actually the most entitled
i keep seeing this why is she unpopular legit question the vp is usually a ghost as far as the media is concerned sure she does interviews on tv but otherwise is n't the subject of many news stories so why is she unpopular
bernie is 82 years old for god 's sake you 're swapping one senior citizen for another he 's still sharper than biden but the point remains the days of electing geriatrics to officee needs to end immediately
the polls are also woefully out of date for other candidates some of them are from 2023 60 % of americans want someone other than trump or biden that 's a huge number that should be considered imho a lot of people on this sub do n't want to hear it unfortunately
well of course they 're going to support biden in public right now that does n't mean hard conversations are n't being had behind the curtains it would be politic malpractice for them to already be calling for him to step down in front of the public even if they are privately convinced he should
ca has the gdp bigger than a lot of countries so “ what you hear ” is probably fascinating does he seem like a more viable candidate than either man who showed up yup
gavin is n't loved but ca voters would get behind him in a heartbeat if he ran he has n't solved all of ca 's problems by a long shot but he 's a competent speaker and has experience and brand recognition
you can say this about many candidates and again it depends on who you ask who in new york likes trump crickets newsom is right now prepping for 2028
for the good of the party and the country she had four years to make americans like her she did n’t manage
yes you are correct i should ’ve specified if it were head to head matchups between trump and biden he would win it would be a narrow win against trump but wins much larger when against biden centrists also give a large sway towards him i just want others to give rfk jr a consideration before committing to biden as he currently stands even if you still do n’t like him just want him to get consideration
totally understandable i just want others to give him a second look and not just write him off quickly based on quick appearances and joke skits
yeah something i recently joked about pre debate to my fam lol but after the performances at the presidential debates that brain worm comment in a different time is still insane is now something i can put aside when hearing his stances and policies totally get if he ’s too crazy for others in this race he is the most competent for me which blows my mind typing down ha
trump looked like he was 30 years younger than biden instead of 3
absolutely but one of them looks like it a lot more than the other
nobody actually cares what trump says but your impression needs work
who has already said he would n't run for office keep dreaming
more people will watch that one because it is much closer to the election and not during summertime when it is n't even dark out when the debate starts but if biden 's numbers are n't changing after that performance that is more of an argument to replace him with bernie it means the dem voters are locked in they are n't leaving no matter what so why not use bernie to get higher turnout with younger voters it 's a low risk situation with significant upside given the unique volatility in turnout among younger voters
lincoln shut himself off from public life for almost a year after the death of his son in 1962 and won reelection in 1964 coolidge functionally abdicated the presidency after the death of his son in july of 1924 and yet he cruised to reelection both saw extensive coverage especially lincoln
ok doom more idk what to tell you vote in november and get 3 friends who were n’t going to go
and 1988 when bush sr was down 17 % to dukakis in july
and frankly 2000 but what his method apparently does n't predict is scotus corruption
he predicted that trump would win 2016 trump even sent him an autograph after for being the only one who got it right
yea but i said there s no evidence for that and unsurprisingly you brought none because its not true it has been shown over and over that the deciding factor in the 2016 election was the turnout of economically disafected voters who had not voted in prior elections not people consuming media via social media but rather fox news and other similar outlets heres some actual sources
trump ’s favorability rating is higher than biden ’s so i ’d say you ’re off base maybe only 20 % of people actually voted for him but he ’s still widely supported by a large chunk of this country
that what bother me about the whole replace biden thing they idiots will gladly watch our democracy slide into a dictatorship because biden old just shut up i would rather have biden die in office of old age and the meh vp take over then a trump dictatorship and project 2025
they should though trump is n’t just a bad choice he ’s a repudiation of american ideals you know this because all he cares about is money and deals he does n’t have principles to protect he ’s anti freedom republicans should turn away from that otherwise they ’re just sports fans a lot of the stuff that most politicians support is consistent with different facets of what america stands for and the hard sacrifices americans may have to make to stand up for a higher standard but trump does n’t even pretend to care about these things it ’s all about taxes and nato republicans with any integrity should realize that he ’s a danger to the future of the country
it ’s the independents and undecided that decided 2020 we need to convince them biden is losing with them for the past 8 months his debate only furthered their concerns we ca n’t just ignore this because one successful historian says otherwise i ’m not hanging my hat on that too much at stake
exactly and democrats are n’t going to vote for a republican just because their candidate is a senile old man who could n’t manage a gas station
independents will swing though and there will be an amount of republicans that vote as a protest for someone else like larry hogan did when he voted for reagan after that old sack of shit was already dead this is not as binary as reddit and the media makes it seem it ’s not a hard “ r votes for trump regardless and d votes for biden regardless ” there is an entire spectrum of swing voters apathetic voters and new voters that will determine this election
he can update the model too to incorporate social media
the base has never gotten a president elected
i ca n’t believe that people think a guy who hosted a primetime tv show for 10 years has no charisma
biden ’s performance at the debate was profoundly shocking at least to me
yes but nobody thought he would have to get helped off a debate stage by his wife for his own good looking like a barely animated corpse
it 's a temporary one it 'll be gone by next week
i do n’t think trump ’s advisors are all that talented even if they were they are not not like he would listen to them anyway and the felony convictions absolutely hurt his numbers with anyone not in his cult
early polling has the debate changing almost no one 's minds pre debate to post debate
it ’s infuriating how we will sit here and criticize trump supporters for blindly supporting their guy and we ’re doing the same thing right now making excuses for this shell of a man that will lose this election we deserve a better candidate than this this sub lives in a complete bubble if they think this will roll off biden like water we should stick to our guns and continue to call for him to step down we ’ll continue to cope until november when he ’s lost and trump is president elect again then it ’ll shift to how we should ’ve put someone different in there when us with our blinders off have seen it all along
this entire sub is a joke the press is filled with stories and op eds from democrats about how catastrophic biden ’s performance was but somehow the front page consists of nothing but rave reviews of a speech he gave the next day it ’s insanity
i voted for biden last time around and in the primary but what i saw in the debate was someone not fit for office i know he has a staff and given the alternative yes i 'll vote for him but running this person is incredibly risky i know it 's also risky to change the candidate late and the obvious alternatives seemingly waiting for the opportunity e g gavin are n't great i still have to believe some democrat could beat trump however who does n't seem like a particularly strong candidate consider for a moment a person in their 40s 50s military veteran and fresh face think of that person across the podium from trump the democrats have representatives in congress like that after a quick search there 's jason crow army ranger bronze star 45 grew up in a major swing state wisconsin leader in successful trump impeachment why are we not getting candidates like this
they still think that was caused by stutter and not because his is just really old and had a bad night like old people do some times
neither man is fit to serve but trump was lucid enough that he will retain all of his votes biden ’s team can scramble all they want trying to reframe the debate and why it does n’t matter but it fucking does lol yall are bonkers if you think biden can win after that fucking dementia ridden performance i do n’t know that swapping another democrat could do it either but idk maybe they got ta try cuz biden is cooked wild wild wild you are if you think the on the fencers will just over look the fact that the man can not form a single lucid thought
i think it ’s possible they have some new information about biden that may have informed their decision
how would it be possible that nobody has been saying “ biden is old so even if he ’s wildly popular we ’d better have a plan b ” it just seems like complete insanity on the part of the dnc to have no contingency and do n’t tell me that kamala harris is the contingency there ’s no way she can win in a scenario where she needs to step in for biden
okay here 's the thing about aging he could have good days he could even have great days but this was n't a one off the bad days will be back and the physical and emotional stress of campaigning is likely to make them more frequent if you 've never been around something like that well you 'd be amazed how much someone can change from one day to the next i had a relative whose last six months of life were an absolute rollercoaster one day she 'd be on top of the news discussing current events with insight and wit the next i 'd have to explain to her that no she could n't get up because she 'd had a stroke and was unable to walk and that she was dying it can be a heartbreaking seesaw
because the way that age works the older you get the older you will look and act because time unfortunately only goes forward
biden will need to bat 100 from now on any slip up and it 's over biden needed to increase his poll numbers not remain the same or decline at least with a new candidate we have a way to grow
sheikh is inevitable do n’t get me wrong biden listens to the right people and as a result is a moderately decent president but things are only downhill from here even in the best case scenario he would be president on his 85th birthday that ’s insane i mean anything is better than trump but the democrats should have been grooming whitmer or newsome to take over from biden years ago
that 's a weak argument trump is not liked and multiple polls show people want an alternative to both candidates i doubt there has been much polling at all in regard to those other potential dem candidates so do n't put too much stock into that one post debate poll has 60 % wanting biden to drop out if you want to cite single polls you say biden is n't behind but he has been consistently behind in the swing states for a while he will lose this election his debate performance was a disaster and magnified fears of his age i do n't see how any rational person can think otherwise lichtman has a great track record for picking winners but this is a unique situation him comparing this to reagan is just plain idiotic reagan 's election year popularity eclipsed biden 's and his debate problems were not as large not to mention 9 years older is still a big difference
biden ’s entire campaign pitches in 2020 and 2024 have been “ i ’m not donald trump ” there is no reason to think that biden voters begging for a non biden alternative would become trump voters rather than vote for whitmer or pritzker or whoever they only stand to gain votes from people that want a candidate with a coherent message who does n’t look and behave like he ’s ancient there is no constituency for joe biden besides anti trumpers
because people do n't just vote for someone because they know they 're name if they were going to vote for trump they would be in the trump block already
biden must stay in i ’m having too much fun watching all the people i dislike meltdown and flip their own lying bullshit narrative overnight
its because biden had to correct trump 's false statements the problem was biden was hard to hear so it seemed more disjointed than it was if you were to read a transcript mostly obviously there were a few big fumbles on his message also that amplified his bad performance
yes in the gentlest possible way i have heard better endorsements
you 're trying way too hard
why would the democrats who are not the underdogs atm run another candidate as an underdog every poll has biden leading
i do n’t think the ones posting politics shit all day are the ones not voting the ones that do n’t vote do n’t pay attention to politics at all
it makes no difference what they do with their time if the previous generation did n’t vote either it ’s counterproductive to shit on a whole generation you want them to vote inspire them do n’t shame them
wow why had n’t young people thought of this must be all the videa games and the mtv
well as nice as it would be for younger people to just go vote the fact of the matter is they do n’t and they need to be inspired to the democrats have run 3 consecutive elections on “ not trump ” with really no hopeful message or reason to vote for them other than they ’re not as bad they learned nothing from obama ’s win in 2008 you need to work with reality biden does n’t inspire young people they ’re currently losing the election they need a reset right now while there ’s still time otherwise it ’s not just biden the white house we lose the apathy that biden brings will make down ballot democrats suffer and give even more power over to the republicans
that ’s the thing what problems has biden fixed none that ’s why his campaign has been flailing for a while he has a 38 % approval rating did people think that was a joke or something no he ’s not likeable he was a compromise candidate who was always supposed to be a one termer and like always he changed his mind once he got a taste of power
when they vote they win democrats elections for them and yet democrats and folks like you seem to have disdain for them instead of courting them this is a democracy no one owes their votes asking for more of a pitch than “ i ’m better than the other guy ” is n’t a stupid thing to do
so your solution to biden being to old is to nominate a candidate even older than him
aoc then she 'll be 35 in october
yeah she ai n’t going to take that any more than biden is going to voluntarily step down politicians are just as self interested as the rest of us are
so you want people to consider throwing their vote away to a third party that does n’t get more than 10 % of the vote in a three way race by falsely framing rfk as a viable candidate based on 1 1 matchups that do n’t reflect the actual election
he also literally spray paints himself
but he ’s in objectively horrible shape and his diet is infamous also he kinda got outted as a speed addict a while back so it ’s not like trump being alert is some achievement biden might die of old age but trumps lifestyle is actively endangering him no one should be living off mcdonalds coke and adderall especially an obese man in his late 70s
trump was literally stringing together nonsense words half the debate he was rambling about things that did n't even make sense we had immaculate water h2o his tirades about immigrants sounding like grandad hazedly recounting fighting the charlie in vietnam
if they did n't care he would n't be where he is today my point in this is that he 'll just say you ca n't run away from him all of a sudden obv
uh the problem is about age and you want to replace him with someone even older
that ’s not true the dnc in many states shut down the primary and made it clear that biden was not to be challenged oops
there was one with the dnc preselecting who they wanted with no real debates or viable alternative candidates and a general condescension towards anyone who would want an alternative at the very least we would have known where biden was at during some debates
i had two coworkers who were planning to vote but they said it ’s pointless after hearing about the shit show of a debate so there ’s that all this cope about biden is just going to result in a wipeout come november
and was the reason that clinton even bothered running against bush sr who was polling at 90 % after expelling saddam from kuwait so many democrats did nt even bother running because they thought bush was unbeatable there 's no such thing as a perfect system but its clear that his is easily the best one available
psh more claims without evidence
this exactly we are n’t just voting for a president we are voting for his vp a competent and moral cabinet the supreme court is biden the best option no but at this point we have to stick with him or else trump will win
it ’s the peoplle who do n’t pay much attention we need to convince these are the ones who willl decide th election they do not see project 2025 they got biden in but now are n’t engaged it ’s not repubs or dems it ’s those individuals biden is losing with them like it or not
that ’s still not a winning argument for independent voters nobody likes kamala harris
it ’s not that i do n’t think he can do the job it ’s that i do n’t think he can win
no one is saying democrats should vote for trump because biden is too old folks are saying democrats can and should do better according to most polls biden is behind trump in the critical swing states that matters the debate was an attempt to shake up the race well we all know how that went you think he gets brownie points for that awful performance
something the democratic party really needs to keep in mind atm
the guy can be a repugnant waste of carbon and still be charismatic
idk what you have been watching then
read the transcript at least skim it when you take away the raspy tired voice and listen to the words that he 's saying he 's pretty on point i did n't realize they were n't allowed notes and looking over fact checkers he rattled off specifics with pretty good not perfect accuracy too now i 'll not deny that he said these words in a profoundly problematic voice but the words themselves are damn well what i want to hear a president say
morning consult poll post debate indicates a majorly of voters including a 47 % plurality of democratic voters believe biden should step aside and be replaced on the ticket opinions that he is too old to be president went from 64 % to 78 % after the debate that ’s a change and a definite impact
a stutter does n't generally make you say we finally beat medicare
it was both his stutter was very pronounced and he did n't do well by next weekend it 'll be nothing
do you mean bat 1000 because if this is a baseball metaphor i do n't think batting 100 is going to get it done
this reagan came across as amiable and a bit dim but i do n't ever remember him looking lost during a debate and he was ridiculously popular for reasons unfathomable
biden ’s performance goes far beyond being hard to hear i worry that something is wrong with him
it ’s almost like i ’m joe biden trying to put two coherent sentences together hey he seems so knowledgeable and together we should allow him to send a trillion dollars to foreign conflicts where his son had a direct financial interest give him the nuclear football and see if he likes pushing shiny buttons
sorry me saying joe biden was trying to string a coherent thought with two sentences together was a little try hard let me re do that trying hard like dianne feinstein trying not to die senile and incompetent after signing power of attorney over to a family member while still in office to transfer interest in multi million dollar properties at a six figure salary
but that does n’t satisfy the reddit bot narrative that young leftists with opinions are the actual problem
it does make a difference social media has changed the landscape in theory all the information to make good decisions is in your pocket this generation ca n’t be compared to precious ones the same way
they did n’t learn from hillary ’s loss either she took midwest support for granted and did n’t campaign at the end that very possibly led to her loss i ’m sure it ate her up but the party does n’t seem to have learned a lesson biden could be making an unforced error if he does n’t step down i hope he makes the right decision whatever it is
his first few months were spent issuing executive orders to reverse a bunch of really terrible policies by trump and here ’s a list of regulatory changes under biden it includes a lot of changes that were reversals of trump policies or neglect of administrative responsibility under trump he fixed a lot of damage trump did and then he accomplished much more instituting policies to help address many long standing issues like drug prices student loans criminal justice reform etc all that said he should have been a one term president as he promised and i no longer think he ’s fit for the office he should withdraw as this powerful statement from the nyt editorial board argues
people who do n't vote have zero political power it 's that simple you want change in the party you do that in the primary and by participating in the party process they get absolutely nothing by not participating it 's not complicated
i have no problem with age i have a problem with lackluster cognitive abilities
i do n’t think people with self interest agree to work until they ’re 85 trump is only running to save himself
yeah i totally agree i do n’t know how to frame him replacing biden without it seeming as a crazy political move i personally feel like if he did get that chance to take a large stage with just trump he would do better than people familiar with him now would expect it ’s a crazy and unpopular opinion and do agree your opinion is the correct one at this point
that 's not a good argument imo it should concern you that biden ca n't even look good compared to a fat speed addict in his late seventies not make you feel better about his cognitive decline
let republicans attack bernie on age good come the september debate bernie would destroy trump more than any other candidate his appeal is more genuine his ability to attack trump is far greater than establishment democrats bernie is n't gon na show signs of confusion or weakness so any discussion of his age will just be a waste of resources by republicans
it ’s not cope bud it ’s reality either you get folks to vote or you ’re comfortable with project 2025 that ’s really it nothing has changed maybe and this is a small maybe biden actually debates well the second time but i really do n’t know i am voting that ’s all i can do enough of this power you think i or you have
it would be interesting to hear candidates talk about their future administration the way a football coach talks about how individual players can make differences “ this secretary will do this that secretary will do that and together we are a stronger team than the group the other guy will cobble together bet on us not our ragtag ineffective opponent ”
but at this point we have to stick with him or else trump will win this is something people say but there 's no evidence at all that it 's the case it 's simply tradition not to replace an incumbent and the incumbency advantage means nothing when everyone thinks the world is in a state of shit right now this is n't a normal election simply because trump is one of the candidates most people are locked in and will vote for trump or biden for no other reason than they think the other guy is worse the swing voters in the middle to be clear i do n't understand how anyone could be confused as to whether trump should be allowed near power are the ones we have to focus on if we 're all on here saying we 'd crawl over broken glass to vote for biden just to keep trump out of office it means we 'd crawl over broken glass to vote for anyone to keep trump out of office it literally means it does n't matter who the democratic nominee is democrats should make sure the person they 're running is perceived as fit for office by the people who will decide the election the swing voters in a handful of states
you might not want to say a vote for biden is a vote for kamala harris i do n’t know a single person who wants her to be potus
trump is easily the most flawed candidate in history and if biden did well which he should have considering he practiced for a week and pushed to have this debate we would n’t be talking about it all he had to do was a solid b and would have won cause trump was terrible yet he could n’t even do that well prepared it ’s a major concern we ca n’t have a candidate in this position
the people who strongly dislike both biden and trump about 20 % of the electorate in polls i 've seen are the ones who need to be convinced people who dislike biden are primarily concerned about his age the campaign has to figure out how to allay those fears somehow given that a top of the ticket change is n't going to happen they better start brainstorming shielding him from the media is not going to cut it he needs to be out campaigning hard preferably in free form environments like interviews and town halls if he 's really too far gone to do that then he 's going to lose simple as
oh hell no i completely agree with you he ’s a disaster and it ’s a disgrace that he ’s the candidate i recently watched my elderly grandparents go through dementia and it ’s honestly hard to watch sometimes i ’m assuming the first lady chief of staff is basically running the country at this point i was just saying the majority of people are dug in either way and that ’s probably one of the reasons the dems who run the party thought they could get by with running biden again it ’s obviously blowing up in their face now but anyone who follows somewhat closely could see this coming
i watched the state of the union speech and figured that was more or less what he was like these days clearly old but still lucid and capable of carrying on normal human communication and interaction about complex subjects over an extended period of time i woud not trust the person i saw at the debate to look after my houseplants let alone the country it was shocking
that same poll says biden lost no immediate ground to trump
did you downvote because you think that is what i think
to put it as mildly as possible
i do n't know shit about baseball lol i was thinking 100 %
his first debate against mondale was brutal people wondered if he was mentally unfit for the office and there were calls for him to step down this what nancy reagan said of the first debate “ it was the worst night of ronnie ’s political career right from the start he was tense muddled and off stride he lacked authority he stumbled this was a ronald reagan i had never seen before it was painful to watch ” but he turned things around at the next debate and won handily on election night
i appreciate the polling unlike many on this subreddit but and i ’ll concede this is my own hypothesizing i can not fathom that whitmer would n’t at a bare minimum match biden ’s performance i can not imagine her floor being lower than the potus with the worst approval ratings during reelection in modern history she does n’t have biden ’s 1st 2nd and 3rd problem age and there is no way she would n’t have completely ripped trump apart on abortion unlike biden who was incapable of mounting any effective response to anything trump said on the democrats ’ biggest issue
satire is supposed to be funny
still trying too hard brevity is the soul of wit your setup is too long and there 's not so much a punchline as a a kind of a rant it 's not very effective edit too to and two damn it
i 'll tell you from my experience it 's not a bot narrative if young progressives were an actual consistent voting block then our politicians would have to cater towards them in order to capture that voting block they just simply do n't vote turnout for voting in 2020 was a record high for 18 34 year olds at 57 % meanwhile the next two cohorts had a 69 % and 74 % turnout it 's incredibly easy to share memes about progressive ideals but the actual work of getting progressives in office still takes place in the real world
there ’s more misinformation in your pocket too and it ’s not just malicious orchestrated propaganda some of it is just plain wrong bullshit that redditors or tiktokers or whoever see and do n’t have the energy interest or sophistication to realize is bullshit and then they parrot it
what problems were fixed immigration is a mess which biden just made worse prices are killing the middle and lower classes which biden is making worse with tariffs concentration camps are still at the borders abortion is still getting outlawed left and right like what actual problems were solved no one cares about placebo bills and policies that do n’t affect the average person
depends on how much you want the job biden has been trying to be president for most of his adult life harris is equally ambitious
rfk jr does n't believe in vaccines or science nuff said
that ’s kinda what policy positions are just without a name or face attached to them whatever the president ’s policy goals are the person they appoint is supposed to carry out that vision for them in this election there ’s also the benefit of both candidates already having done the job for a term so we already have an idea of who would make up their cabinet like would people prefer the return of rick perry heading the dept of energy or devos controlling education
i mean literally watch the next day speech he just made that ’s also still there i trust biden ’s camp his policy is far better project 2025 is straight to authoritarian rule i trust his future at this point i do n’t really care what biden did it ’s not a hard decision trump has fully gone into dictator mode you vote against that not for anything if you have to here is his next day speech
i did n't downvote you
yeah it was brutal but imo not as brutal as some of what i saw last night
i ’m certainly cackling at that debate performance last night you should read the transcript it ’s like an ink blotter test every time the word biden appears
joe biden is a dumbass did that one do it for you
i ’m privileged to live in oregon where i ’ve been voting by mail for 20 years it ’s culturally different when you could n’t cast a vote in person even if you wanted to to not vote in a state like this is a shameful abdication that ’s part of why republicans are so set on casting mail voting as vulnerable to fraud people who can vote from their living room are more likely to make a considered researched choice than people who make a point to get down to the polling station so that they can throw their weight behind their cult leader
young progressives very nearly put up an alternative to biden and were stopped by the party apparatus they are a voting block and they worked hard for progressive candidates especially between 2016 2020 record high turnout during a year that going to the polls meant risking your health seems fairly decent to me given that our democracy ’ is designed to be antithetical to the material needs of young people
oh you ’re one of those all or nothing none of the things he did count because there are other problems that are much more difficult to solve or not the president ’s fault do you think the president controls inflation or abortion congress has to protect abortion but it ’s a broken institution i do n’t think there are “ concentration camps ” right now but there would be under a second trump term
biden is only running because he thinks it ’s the only way to beat trump do you really think he wants to die in office it ’s not a low chance if he wins
i mean if that ’s your line in the sand to not cross i respect that and would normally agree that debate was a turning point for me i now and always will vote against trump it just made me realize biden will be the compromise candidate we have to go with and so desperately wish it were n’t the case the positive from all this has made me understand rfk jr better and hope a candidate that embodies all of the positive stances he portrayed in his debate shows up in 2028
i associate policy positions with the party with which the candidate is aligned i do n’t need joe to tell me he supports abortion and paths to citizenship and a social safety net because he ’s a democrat if he was n’t for those things he would n’t be a democrat instead tell us how you ’re actually going to make a difference on those things because swing voters want the country to improve not to stay stagnant people tell me joe has been one of the most effective presidents ever i ’m skeptical of the hyperbole but if his infrastructure and whatever accomplishments are both meaningful and also the result of specific actions on his part then he needs to focus on that or say “ i will protect reproductive rights in these ways ” instead of just saying “ donald wo n’t do anything to protect them ” i want a plan not a philosophy
the fact he is n't like that 24 7 does n't fix it the fact he is like that at all is the problem the president of the united states should n't be someone who has bad days like that
i trusted biden ’s camp until the debate but not any more i agree with you about the danger trump poses which makes me all the more enraged by the fact that they concealed biden ’s condition from the public until it was too late to do anything about it based on some egotistical fantasy that out of every other person in the country only biden could defeat trump they may had meant well but objectively speaking they ’ve done more than anything trump himself could have done to ensure that trump is elected this fall
i agree to some extent but i also think there is overreaction and trump certainly did not deliver a performance equal to mondale 's the bad palestinian black jobs the space age material from asia comments are not good soundbites let 's see when the dust settles
it ’s like an ink blotter test ever time the word biden appears do you mean a rorshach test do the letters of his name become pictures ever time i mean if biden 's name becomes an actual rune when written down that sounds kind of cool
it 's definitely shorter and does n't feel as tryhard but now it 's less a joke and more of an opinion and yeah i 'm laughing but maybe not for the reason you think
all this is true but they still showed up in much lower numbers than the other two cohorts the younger generation simply does n't vote in large enough numbers to be the most important block
yes they are n’t concentration camps when it ’s biden or obama but they are under trump y’all are lost completely delusional
anyone but rfk jr i would take newsom or whitmer 1000x over rfk jr and so would every other democrat most democrats not just me would be turned off by his ant vaxx talk so he 's as a candidate is a non starter
bud trump fell asleep during his trial biden is going to be like that that was a conversation to be had in 2020 we are way past that trump 100 % has bad days he rambled about sharks and thought arizona was texas he went on a five minute rant about how america took over airports and the sky during the revolutionary war we both agree you should n’t be over 75 and even be allowed to run
trump only is elected if you do n’t vote you win at the ballot box not debates not polls ask hillary
no i mean the word salad of “ we beat medicare ” and “ initiative but or errr uhh ban asylum officers ” is like if someone came in my ass and then i shit onto a page with diarrhea farts yes you can refer to it as a rorschach test but it is commonly referred to as an ink blot test as well it ’s weird sometimes things can be referred to in two separate ways but mean the same thing i ’m glad i could teach you that
hey while we are pointing out tryhard notice how i do nt downvote you because i do nt care and notice how every time i comment you click the little button to put me at zero because you feel like it matters somehow or that you need to try hard to disagree lmao
it 's amazing how all it takes is 1 bad speech from biden to make everyone forget about all the batshit crazy things trumps says
i mean nothing obama said here is wrong we ca n't really expect him to suddenly turn on biden and cause a huge rift any concerns are going to be voiced in private and not in public
this obama cat is pretty eloquent he should run for office
i think obama may be the person best positioned to have a difficult conversation with biden about what ’s really at stake and what the uncomfortable truths are
sincerely loyal and lifelong democrat here i promise but people keep saying things like “ poor performance ” and “ lost the debate ” as if that were the issue biden did n’t “ lose ” a debate he showed up mentally unfit for a debate he collapsed at the gate it was n’t poor performance he could t perform and you ca n’t gaslight folks into thinking that it ’s a good idea to hand an increasingly volatile world stage back to a man who probably should n’t be allowed to drive you know i ’ll still be voting against trump but the debate seriously makes it difficult to vote for biden and for me that ’s a big deal
well yeah as long as biden is running against convicted felon trump he should have support if biden walked on stage crapped his pants then walked off without saying anything i ’d still vote for him over the alternative
look i will vote for whoever is on the democratic ticket so long as trump is on the republican ticket however i believe many normal people who do n’t follow politics will be so appalled by how biden looked that they will not vote for him after last nights debate it is time to put someone else in as the candidate or else you are handing trump an easy electoral victory i fear that obama not talking joe into stepping aside will be catastrophic
it ’s crazy how quickly and publicly democrats turn on their own when republicans always stick to their candidates even when they ’re convicted felons
circle the wagons time you are here hope the poll numbers improve if they do n’t then maybe actually change ship 5 14 days from now
beam me back to 2013 2014
this is hilarious since he begged him not to run when he had more cognition than he does now
the real problem here is kamala if people were ok with her taking over if joe dies in office he ’d be doing better in polling
he says this publicly privately he 's freaking out no doubt in my mind
dude coulda torched him and change world history
it ’s really weekend and bernie ’s at the dnc right now
maybe if obama did n't have his head up the clinton 's asses in 2016 he would n't have betrayed his vp by encouraging him not to run if biden was the nominee in 2016 he would have destroyed trump and we would n't be in this situation right now
i hear dido faintly singing somewhere in the distance
the gaslighting will continue until morale improves
i blame obama not even joking he pushed for hillary in 2016 and convinced joe to stay out of it joe would have won in 2016 and be retired by now
it 's so sad to see how quickly this sub turns to copium popping in a halls and reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter with a little more vigor is really enough for some of you until last night the narrative has been my age is n't holding me back at all and after absolutely shitting the bed on live television it 's yeah i 'm old but i 'm a decent guy
absolute lunacy biden was a walking corpse last night might as well dig feinstein up and run her at this point
better biden than don the con
but seriously now who is the better golfer
gaslighting the entire country by telling people they did n’t just see what they saw is a losing electoral strategy
it ’s a bit insulting the way everything is being spun as alright after last night a part of me understands why so many do n’t trust the media trump is going to trounce biden
the job of a candidate is not same as the job of a president biden obviously struggles as a communicator which means he 's not great as a candidate but his record behind the resolute desk proves that he is actually very skilled as a president bipartisan infrastructure legislation gun regulations our largest clean energy investment resurrecting nato historically low unemployment economic growth that is the envy of the world i could go on his problem is that he does n't know how to dance on command not that he ca n't do the job of president watch his speech today in nc if you are someone with lingering doubts about his acuity lawrence o'donnell made how people are now focused on imagery rather than substance he points out that fdr arguably our best president could not have won an election in 2024 because he looked old and frail
backing him for now at least biden is clearly mentally unfit to serve he should just retire and ride off into the sunset never understand why these politicians cling onto power for so long
the amount of people that still think biden has a chance after this is mind boggling there ’s no viable path to 270 after this he needs to bow out of the race
gawd obama could have injected some fresh blood into the democratic party and instead elevated past their prime mainstays like biden and hilary sigh
obama choked in his first debate with romney
between someone who tells the truth who knows right from wrong and will give it to the american people straight and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit you know who else seems to be lying through their teeth for their own benefit the democrats like obama who are pretending that joe is fine and that he wo n’t be barely functioning in 4 more years i get that trump is a threat to democracy but do n’t spit in my cheerios and call it milk i have eyes i know they saw the same thing i did last night i know they ’ve probably seen worse behind the scenes and i know they are all freaking out behind the scenes and have to say all this to save face fuck all of these people and their greed for leading us into this situation to begin with we should n’t even be having a conversation about an 81 year old man being president until he is 86 it ’s ridiculous
what gets me is that it 's fair to assume this version of biden we 're seeing is already on as much prescription uppers and medication to perk him up it looks like he 's on valiums rather than uppers though seriously would n't a few pills before a night like this at least give him appearance of being energetic he must have teams of doctors able to prescribe anything
i really got ta think hope that everyone had their mind made up before the debate anyway that said as long as trump can pull off being the only advocate for many of his supporters he wo n't have to be accountable for anything
biden had a bad night he 's old not evil
backing biden and the debate was n't going to change my mind the alternative is theocratic fascism
terrible debate performance but the choice is still clear
we need to stop the denial it ’s not working anymore no one cares if you are a “ vote blue no matter who ” type swing voters are n’t and after the debate they ’re not going to vote for biden replace biden or trump will those are your options
biden said himself he was bad last night energy is miles better today in north carolina
i think his debate performance was abysmal but he 's still been the best president of my lifetime so i 'm still voting for him again
the difference is obamas bad performance was like jordan having an off game he could come back and clean up biden ’s bad “ performance ” was more like an aging player who no longer has the ability to do it anymore
so biden stays on the ballot and trump will be president next year got it there is no way that biden can win against trump he is far to weak a candidate
sure it ’s cool to freak out today but literally nothing has changed and neither has anyone ’s views
because of ohio they only have until august 7 to change the nomination
wow i did n’t expect obama to endorse trump
can we just give the term to obama four more years
interesting no one points out this debate was at 9pm i 'd be nowhere near my best and i do n't also have to be president every day have the next debate at 9am biden will be in his peak performance time and trump will be falling asleep like he did during his trial
what kind of stupid fucking story is this like he ’s ever gon na back trump ever of course he backs biden what ’s a fucking waste of words
well he 's hardly gon na back trump but we get why this matters
at this point we 're voting for vice potus pick your favorite next in command because there is a fair to strong chance they will be taking the reigns in the next 4 years
lol could one imagine obama backing trump
great so trump is n’t going to win
i mean was he gon na do something else
it would be kinda funny if obama backed trump after that tho
can obama vp would be an amazing
america is doomed with those elites our german ones are incompetent too but that is next level
i love the dichotomy on one hand dems are starting to turn on biden for his bad debate rep have never turned on trump for all his shitshow and shortcoming also after becoming a felon it 's incredible it shows you all you need to know about who votes republicans and their values
the democratic party establishment must stop ' picking ' old legacy candidates based on seniority loyalty oaths and brushing off concerns of voters and allowing this to happen they should have put up a much stronger candidate that would be able to refute trump 's lies during the actual debate instead they continue to be the disappointing centrist top down capitalist pro isreal party this country needs a true left party and it needs the dnc to step up and be that or i do n't see the point of voting for it
why is every democratic politician openly gaslighting everyone about what we saw with our own two eyes we saw a formerly great in my opinion president who could not string two coherent sentences together on national television not only did he perform horribly but he has proved the republicans right about his mental acuity and age i drank the media kool aid and truly believed he was n’t as bad as every republican says he is now i have seen exactly what they meant while every pro biden media source tried to demonize any one who said anything negative about biden ’s age it would be an incredible disservice to the people of america the concept of america and the world as a whole to stand by biden instead of dropping him he is clearly not fit to be president for another four years and i sincerely hope he realizes this and bows out while his presidency can be remembered for the success it was regardless of the trump bullshit he spoon fed his supporters any serious candidate should have destroyed trump ’s lies and rhetoric but all we got to see was a feeble old man in the beginning stages of dementia try and answer questions that would have been layups for any other democratic candidate with a solid grasp of politics in the usa the fact that democrats are trying to spin this debate as a win in quite frankly offensive to me and i sincerely hope that they are shitting their pants figuring out what to do about biden ’s campaign for the presidency which he will absolutely lose to trump in november
gee i would n’t have guessed that obama would back biden what a fucking revelation
nothing trump said last night answered the questions he was asked he talks in tweets which have underlying tones of racism misogyny and his complete lack of understanding of the real issues
trump literally had to say he did n't sleep with a pornstar people are delusional
i do n’t think anyone forgot it ’s just not noteworthy anymore trump being a pathologically lying xenophobic sexist asshat is what we all expected so there ’s not much to comment on it ’s just trump being trump biden on the other hand we were hoping would be in top form for a very important night he was nowhere near top form
i do n't think that 's fair my dislike of trump is exactly why biden has me concerned
it 's the fear of 2016 by putting someone up to run who does n't inspire confidence the voters wo n't turn out to vote like in 2016 in 2020 joe got to run against trump after trump being in office for 4 years so everyone knew they disliked him and voted for biden and barely won this time biden has been in office for 4 years and his fault or not a lot of people are n't doing good and have forgotten just how bad things were under trump but if biden ca n't inspire the fence voters to get out we will lose and lose are chance of getting the house last night was a shit show
i know the bar is low to want a president that can speak coherently
calling it a bad speech is n't a good description this was watching him struggle mentally on camera yes i know he has a stutter but that does n't account for all the instances of incoherence i still plan on voting for him with trump as the alternative but otherwise it feels disqualifying and i wish he 'd step down everyone who 'd still vote for him after that would still vote for his replacement who would also have a chance at picking up independents double haters
look i hate trump but you ca n't expect me to want to vote for biden
do n’t act like biden ’s decline has not been ongoing for months the democratic party ’s refusal to have an honest primary put biden on display and allow us a chance to pick an alternative will be directly to blame for our next 4 years of trump
yup here ’s a speech joe gave today it ’s like night and day compared to last night
this is not an isolated event
i do n’t think anybody forget about how bad trump is but and i also do n’t think it ’s totally honest to chalk his debate performance up to “ 1 bad speech ” it very clearly indicated that guy is suffering very serious cognitive decline and is obviously unfit for office will still gladly vote for him over trump but let ’s not act like last night was anything but an unmitigated disaster
nobody 's forgetting they 're just growing disillusioned
yeah it takes a convicted rapist and felon like trump to make biden look good i would vote for a side of spoiled meat before i would vote for trump
nobody has forgotten we know who trump is he is a traitorous piece of shit dictator who had no place on that stage last night however neither did his octogenarian counterpart the security of the nation is at risk here we ca n't afford a president who is struggling to focus and who is highly unlikely to complete another term it makes absolutely no sense to even consider someone in his condition what 's worse is he knows the stakes here he is willing to risk the united states losing its democracy just so he can have another term it 's bullshit biden is a piece of shit for running again he was a great president for one term and i really liked him now i am furious with him for staying on a second time he 's going to ruin his legacy and he might ruin the country what a fucking fool and yes as long as it 's my only choice i will be voting for the guy who will most likely die before he finishes another year in office my mom went from a condition resembling biden 's to her grave a few weeks ago and it took a total of 18 months
i 'm going to post this on every thread i can because it 's so batshit insane it needs repeating trump said that democrats birth live babies at full term and then decide whether or not to let them live or kill them the media response to this debate biden is losing the plot it 's like every single absolutely batshit terrorist inducing lie is just fine no one is asking trump to drop out being a genocidal psycho is just him this country is done as a functioning entity but it appears a lot of people have n't quite figured that out yet
we have n’t forgotten we want a candidate that can beat trump and that ’s not biden
yeah the so called “ liberal ” media is at fault here you get a bully off your back by punching him in the teeth not by being nice to him nobody at those networks call out his nonstop lies this orange bastard got over a million of us killed cause he lacks the ability to defer to smarter people and admit he ’s wrong on something
the incessant doomposting is so bizarre to me
acting like they both did n't say batshit crazy stuff is the height of propaganda
“ all it takes is 1 bad speech ” bro every day he ’s wandering around not knowing what he ’s doing the guy is very senile
it 's not the bat shit crazy stuff from trump it 's that undecided voters saw trump understand and answer questions without looking sounding and acting like he was taking his last breath and forgetting where he was we need confidence in our leaders and undecided voters are going to determine this election not lifelong democrats or republicans optics play a huge role in an election and right now bidens optics are really bad
i think that was the whole point sadly cnn just wants a boost in ratings
the consequences of this going sideways are fucking grim we 'll never cast a meaningful vote again and political prisoners will be the norm and maybe a whole lot worse
i expected exactly that from trump i did not expect that from biden
it 's all the news will talk about most news networks are owned by billionaires who want trump to win which means we are going to be subjected to whatever psychological tactics will work to manipulate us into voting against our interests which includes every headline talking about how biden failed instead of how trump just straight up lied dodged questions insulted and overall acted in bad faith as the fucking president of my country if that dishonesty is what makes the best of my country then we deserve to fail voting for biden is the only alternative please vote
nothing about trump last night was new it was just trump same old story
one thing no one talks about is even if biden only lives 5 minutes after the beginning of his second term he has already filled all the critical positions with competent people life will go on with barely a blip trump never managed to completely staff the whitehouse and almost all the people he did bring in ended up being criminals it 's going to be a shitshow of biblical proportions of he gets anywhere near the oval office in this rare case i sincerely hope that he 's not trump will be enough to bring out the vote
i do n’t think anyone that held the belief that trump was an awful president before came out of this debate thinking trump was best fit for office lol but this is the kind of stuff we get when we allow the democratic party to blow down other candidates over a man who undeniably has dementia and does n’t even look like he wants to be there anymore if trumps in office come january blame the democratic party for being stubborn and not acting in americas best interest we could ’ve caught this over a year ago if we held primary debates but ya know “ that ’s not historical precedent ” lol neither is having a presidential candidate with dementia fighting the greatest threat to our country ever
it was n't a speech though he does well with speeches this was stand there and shoe people you 'll make it to christmas and maybe showcase trumps many weaknesses there seems to be a difference
that ’s a mischaracterization of democratic biden critics correctly characterized all it takes is one bad performance from biden such that he confirmed live and in real time that he is a frail and elderly man who does not in fact instill confidence he is not in “ leadership shape ” and all the people who want trump out hate that jb is the best the dems system whatever could offer in sum the correct characterization is that neither candidate instills trust and neither at least imo deserves to win this race but we ’re stuck
it ’s not the “ one bad speech ” and no one is forgetting trump is a fucking moron it ’s that he could n’t pull his shit together and fucking perform when it mattered most biden needed to eviscerate trump in this debate and what he got into a golf argument and stumbled through basic talking points trump is a lying twat that will sell us all for a modicum of power but jesus fuck can the democratic party just admit their mistake and course correct already
he should step down he was elected because he was n't trump that 's it
people remember the last thing they saw and they also base things off appearances it does n't matter if trump spouted a bunch of bigotry and lies he looked coherent and confident and got his words out while biden was bumbling around maybe biden will do better in other debates but people are going to remember this one look at the first debate of 1960 kennedy looked attractive and nixon looked like a sweaty mess people watching on tv thought nixon lost and people listening on radio thought he won after that nixon put more effort in being prepared to be on tv for the other debates but all people remember is the first one where he looked all sloppy
it 's the fundamental problem i noticed in western liberal vs facist problem facist are united in their hate while liberals are not in their love democrates are split if biden is the best person from gaza to this debate while maga will rally behind trump understand any circumstances as a result biden is under significantly more scrutiny while trump can do whatever he wants and still maintain his votes trump is n't going to win because he got more popular but rather because biden is n't popular enough
dude c'm on that was n't one bad speech that was exposing how completely unfit for office he is noone is saying trump is n't an utter disaster he is but because he is such a danger it 's vital to have the strongest candidate to defeat him and biden categorically ai n't it
regardless of trump being crazy i think we can all admit that biden did not do well are we all gon na vote for biden regardless sure but we can also admit that he looked and sounded terrible
no one forgets about trump they ’re pissed at the fact dems had four years to come up with a better candidate and this is what they ’re running jfc it ’s like redditors are children “ my candidate sucks but look at yours ”
maybe we should n't have run him as an incumbent due to the norm he was n't our best bet and we all know that
it 's amazing how everyone is painting this as a comparison to trump when in reality it should be in comparison to the rest of the democratic candidates that would have a strong chance if biden did n't insist on pulling an rbg and refuse to give up power when it 's right too as opposed to when he has to everyone here on this sub for the most part thoroughly agrees trump is a disgrace to this country the debate is between biden or someone like newsom or whitmer or other options this is an issue people have been bringing up since before his original announcement and confirmation it has little to do with one speech aside from this one particular speech being a notably bad public affirmation of many people 's worst thoughts and fears
exactly let ’s count the trump lies and how he talked about his fraudulent golf game
it was n't a bad speech it was showing very cleat cognitive decline you can say he has his good and bad days but this is the president of the most powerful nation we are talking about what happens when a crisis falls on a bad day not to mention if he wins he will be president for 4 5 more years rather than 6 more months i have seen his decline from 2012 to 2020 to 2024 go back and watch old clips of him anyone who says it is not clear mental decline is being dishonest he needs to step down and let literally anyone else take on trump cause if trump wins and project 2025 is implemented it is over and that will be bidens legacy and the fault of the dnc and biden
nobody has forgotten about trumps lying if anything the debate highlighted that he just kinda says whatever he thinks sounds good regardless of facts that in no way means we should disregard biden clearly suffering from a mental decline to be honest i ’m starting to see a lot of comments from people who are denying and minimizing biden ’s poor performance it ’s almost identical to how trump supporters disregard his lying and it ’s pretty worrying tbh
it 's like a repeat of last time one note from comey and that 's all the press bleated about it 's almost as if they want trump to win
we already knew trump is unqualified to be president biden just proved he is also failing and should step aside insane to think he ’s fit for office now let alone 4 years from now
ok first off i ’m not from the us so i do n’t know how much merit my opinion would have in the eyes of a us citizen but imo the order in which is vote is definitely biden some random guy a literal turd sandwich trump but i ca n’t understand why the democrats should n’t nominate a guy that shares bidens views but it ’s like 25 years younger as an outsider i think bidens team does really good work but genuinely he is at an age at which he should n’t be allowed to be president no matter his perceived mental and physical health same goes for trump ofc but with trump it ’s more the being batshit crazy that should keep him out i ’d still vote for him one hundred percent of the orange lunatic but i would not exactly be happy about it i also know ofc that a sitting president on average has better chances at actually winning the election but i ca n’t quantify if that advantage is n’t lost by swing voters perception off him
yeah if only there was a similar reaction when trump was first campaigning for 2016 everyone has always allowed him to play by a different set of rules i 'd still take biden on his worst day over trump at his best
people do n't forget that trump is crazy this line of thinking is so binary and distorted people are rightly worried that biden came across so badly that he wo n't beat trump biden being criticised does not mean the critics are trump fans its the complete opposite they desperately want someone to beat trump he should 've been destroyed in that debate
1 bad speech are you fucking high he ’s been mumbling and bumbling and falling and short circuiting his entire time in office
it ’s not amazing there are 2 widely different narratives constantly being spread by media companies and their fan bases believe what ever they hear guiding ppl to their opinions
what ’s wild to me is how many people do n’t see the analogy to what the dnc did with hilary in 2016 everyone tells them she ’s not that popular they push through anyways and then we lose
nothing about that debate would make me switch my vote from biden to trump but i 'm more concerned about those undecided voters or unmotivated voters that see his performance and question if they want to vote for him and end up handing the election to trump these debates matter and hand waiving it away as if it 's just a bad night and no one should care is disingenuous
just because we all know trump is a piece of shit does n't mean biden did well on the debate he is a senile old man and shame on his family for letting him go through this
it 's not one bad speech he 's clearly been declining for a while let 's tell it like it is
seems like it 's the media saying that but then i just see people commenting everywhere that they 're even more determined to vote for biden i feel like this is a lot of media attempting to stoke what makes them money that 's rarely good for us but i hope people continue to see through the bullshit and vote the smart choice
it was n't 1 bad night though people know better we need a new candidate joe is a great person but it 's time and what we saw is a genuine issue for what happens behind the scenes at the whitehouse and is a huge concern for the next 4 years he wo n't make the next 4 years his team and wife pushing for him to continue is a really shitty and borderline elder abuse
i agree but it was n’t a bad speech it was other things as well a speech he has a teleprompter a debate he does not
it 's weird to think someone actually won this nonsense
it was n't just one bad speech biden has been like this for years remember the america is a nation that can be defined in a single word incident or the cuecards
yeah obama like all high ranking dems must publicly default to the expected remain calm messaging but privately there 's probably no one other than the current first lady who is better equipped to tell the president to gracefully bow out than obama i do n't think biden can rebound from last night especially given that he just handed the gop 90 minutes of highlight reel footage that will repeated in commercials constantly between now and november for the good of the country biden must withdraw from the race and obama must lead in getting him to do it before it 's too late the stakes are too high
i disagree i expect anyone who cares about democracy to sound the fucking alarms after last night false hope that americans will turn out in droves to elect a senile octogenarian should not be what stands between our way of life and full bore fascism anyone who ’s not willing to say that at this inflection point is a moral coward full stop
we do n’t know what obama is saying to biden in private he may be trying to convince him to step aside
yeah but i mean he also knows him personally and would best understand what it feels like to run for president twice obama had his own fumbles i ca n’t say for certain he ’s considerably concerned in private but i think it ’s just as likely he ’s just not as pessimistic as the rest of the nation right now
he ’s way too young maybe he ’ll be ready in 30 years
he ’s the one who convinced sanders to finally face the music in 2020 after all
and then what what happens after biden drops out i ’m looking for the name of the person who can beat trump
in that case he probably would
i do n't know why people have this idea that anyone else can take biden 's spot having someone else step in to take biden 's place other than kamala is n't an option none of the governors who are politically positioned to take the spotlight have a single dollar they can legally use as federal campaign funds the fact of the matter is joe biden 's campaign is the only one in the country that can currently participate in the election against trump completely due to finances can you be confident enough to bet that the democrats in this country are going to panic donate enough money to the new candidates you want to risk trump getting back into office based purely on that bet i 'm willing to bet the delegates do n't want to also we already do polling on how every democrat performs against trump and biden polls better than kamala does in every single one of them biden is the only option right now that 's where we 're at the only discourse dems should be doing right now is talking about his strengths and accomplishments point out how despite biden 's inability to get the words out he told the truth to the nation he spoke about striving to make america strong meanwhile trump lied deflected to the same attacks repeatedly and could n't stay on topic when asked very simple questions and for the love of god let kamala do more interviews to talk about biden 's successes and the things he wants to accomplish we really need her younger voice to be a prominent part of the campaign to remind people that things will be fine regardless of biden 's age
but one person did walk on stage crap their pants and walk off stage
this is n't about you or me it 's about swing voters biden needs to step down
this is literally the same logic trump 's supporters follow as well though it 's disgusting to see what us politics has devolved into yeah my guy is a convicted felon and proven liar but at least he can speak for 3 minutes straight without falling asleep sure my guy is a demented old man who should n't even be in charge of dressing himself in the morning let alone given access to nuclear codes but at least he is n't a convicted felon the two best candidates for one of the world 's largest superpowers btw
if biden died on the campaign trail then he ’d get replaced the next day the dnc already has people they could put in there is biden dying really a better alternative than him continuing on i would n’t say so but that line is super blurry after that debate i do in fact believe that biden dying and being replaced would increase the democrat ’s likelihood to win the election yesterday was a sad day for americans
i do n’t follow politics at all but i would still vote for anyone other than trump there ’s enough out there in the world that makes him come off as nuts and quite scary i know biden old but he has a team that he listens to and works with all he needs in my book
people here keep saying that they 'll vote for a corpse over trump but that kinda language does not inspire confidence in biden lmao i 'm expecting a big drop in turnout compared to 2020 even more so after that debate and a drop in turnout likely benefits trump
yeah biden was already losing in pretty much every swing state before that debate too right
i mean as if trump looked much better he may not be as old but dude still has the worst facial expressions and as orange blob as it gets give me grandad biden please until america can get its ass together and give us some candidates on their death beds or starting their criminal wrap sheet out
when the polls are released get ready for an engaging discussion about how they may be flawed
why on earth would the poll numbers improve after last night
some people are gon na be waiting for awhile on poll numbers to improve with next weekend being a de facto holiday weekend
do n’t forget blame progressives when the dem loses
we cannot let this go biden needs to bow out he is not going to get better over time
final point or maybe first breathe
my wife showed me a video of obama debating romney in 2012 and i realized i d completely forgot what an actual debate looks like they were actually talking about policy and obama was such a confident orator
why is she so unpopular the vp should obviously be the next one ready to take the reins if the president becomes incapacitated put her on the ballot
biden actually sounded normal today in north carolina do n’t know wtf happened last night he ’s literally going to have to repeat what he did today every single day until the election considering how bad last night was he will have to do public rallies pretty much every day and hope for no more fuck ups
he ’s been freaked out about biden running since 2014 he chose hillary over biden for 2016 and certainly was n’t high on biden ’s 2020 campaign until it became a question of consolidating around a moderate or letting bernie win none of that is speculation it ’s all well established but biden wo n’t go away and if he wo n’t go away obama is apparently unwilling to begin the ugly process of helping force biden ’s hand he must feel the candidate who would emerge would be worse off than biden himself
i wonder what obama thought when biden said “ we beat medicare ”
it 's very rare for a party to go 12 years in modern american politics the pendulum swings regardless if biden had lost to trump in 2016 instead of hillary it would 've been likely impossible for her or sanders to beat trump in 2020 maybe it was fate or maybe obama understood that 12 years is tough task but hillary lost 2016 on her own by not even campaigning in midwest at all
it 's been pretty well established by the biden family themselves that joe did n't run in 2016 because he was still reeling from beau 's death beau passed in may of 2015 and biden would need to start putting together a campaign in the summer and be ready to announce his bid in the fall so i do n't think there 's some nefarious obama the clintons and the dnc stopped biden from running conspiracy going on a father lost his child and he needed time to mourn and heal
if if if if jeff probst had gotten involved in a sex scandal survivor would have flopped and mark burnett would not have been able to produce the apprentice and donald trump would be as relevant as roseanne barr
right so many comments with links to today ’s speech saying “ he can still talk good see ” the whole world just watched a train wreck on national television it never really was a secret but it feels like the cat ’s out of the bag we ’re in trouble if he gets even a little worse
her age is an advantage you know
if trump trounces biden purely based on his confidence despite having no policies no ideas no morals that whole “ insurrection ” thing then the us is a very very dumb country not defending biden ’s debate performance but people acting like one debate somehow cancels out the last decade of trump ’s utter bullshit is nuts
opeds are n't spinning this as alright so so many are calling for biden to step down
i would argue that the job of a president very much is the same as the candidate be an effective communicator have a good head on your shoulders and be aware of current situations the job of the president can more easily fall to his entourage
fdr has polio and died at 63 during his 4th term for his first election he was only 51 and could n’t walk yet most the public did n’t know that biden is 30 years older than that
they ’re insulated from the costs of their greed we ordinary citizens will pay for this campaign by living in an open kleptocracy for the rest of our lives
my thought is go in the next months with “ these are the people i surround myself with a vote for me is a vote for them ” message
yep all people care about is perception and the fact is biden looked like the zombie all the facebook memes and conspiracy theorists claimed calling last nights debate “ just a bad night ” would be like calling the titanic just a bad night it was the worst possible outcome
these reactions are hilarious people have short memories just a month and a half ago he gives a killer sotu speech and everyone was impressed then he has a bad night at a debate and it 's doomsday come september he 'll have had some some strong speeches and a few wins and nobody will care about the debate anymore or maybe trump does something else worse to alienate independent voters anything can happen between now and november
trump is a criminal and a rapist and tried to overturn democracy who knew the actual dealbreaker for the american people was one bad debate performance
yeah but this is different its not like biden just had a bad debate and lost on points this debate highlighted the irredeemable crisis of biden 's age
people not to stop spewing this bs this is not about having a bad debate it ’s about looking like you are on deaths door a coming across as a confused old man who ca n’t put sentences together looking like you physically and mentally not able to hold office is not the same as simply not answering questions or responding to your opponent well it appears dems are sticking with the guy on deaths door though so i guess we see how authoritarian it gets with trump this time around great job guys
i agree this is absolutely absurd get biden out of the way and put a real candidate up there even the best politicians have to retire sometime there ’s no shame in it
bud there 's zero chance any democrat would publicly admit they 're thinking about replacing him thinking these statements means those discussions are n't happening is extremely naive
this joe is a good man and he has a good team surrounding him we get that but he is the dem candidate only because party elders insisted it be so whether out of deference or party politics they have increased the chance of a trump victory so at the end of the day they ca n't have it both ways say that democracy is being threatened in unprecedented ways yet transact business as usual when it comes to their part
no one ’s going to watch every random speech and it wo n’t really matter seeing as they ’re scripted it ’s not the same
what you ’re missing is that it does n’t matter if it truly was a one off night and every other day from now until november he ’s coherent and speaks fine the point is that the debate last night is what millions of americans tuned in for they ’re not tuning into all these campaign speeches they saw that debate and what they saw was appalling and why it really matters a lot is because it affirmed the strongest and most effective criticism that has been lobbed against biden for years now that he ’s too old to do the job it does n’t matter whether he ’s actually too old to do the job or not what matters is that millions of americans were just convinced that he ’s too old and you ’re absolutely insane if you think that performances like last night are n’t going to happen again for biden they will happen again and again and at this point biden has nothing to protect him it was a “ emperor has no clothes ” moment truly
we are back to coping in this sub already lol that was not a bad night that was someone showing that they have reached senility
there has been a significant change in the political landscape from last night if you have n’t noticed it your head is in the sand
there have been discussions in the media about biden dropping out and being replaced by gavin pete or kamala it looks like obama does n’t share that sentiment
i do n't know about that he made it very clear in the climate change question that we had h2o under him and it was the best and now a biden has taken that from us how dare he
he straight up said his view in the middle east was to let israel roll through palestine and take them out he said that he would end the war in ukraine before taking office trump had a terrible performance that would be the topic had joe been jacked up instead of sleepy
trump could have stepped on stage shit his pants and wallowed in it for 90 minutes he would n’t lose one vote biden needed to crush it last night and he withered like a wet fart
so basically it was a thursday for donald trump
40 % of americans ' he 's just like us '
beellions and beellions that ’s all i remember from his bullshit every time
yea he 's speaking to his base
if he went up against a candidate with a high school debate level of presence he 'd have been absolutely schooled this whole situation is embarrassing
that may be true but trump had h2o we lost our h2o when biden became prez
yeah it ’s a shame he ’s the only living candidate fuck this election cycle man
not true when asked if he would support an independent palestinian state he responded with “ i ’d have to see ” lol
yeah trump is terrible but what is the point in acting like the story is something that it ’s not last night very clearly demonstrated that biden ’s cognitive state is significantly worse than everyone thought the democrats have to replace him
rbg let her ego win out in her last days as opposed to doing the right thing and stepping aside joe seems headed the same way
it ’s on us voters then
not only that the house will pick the president
i agree biden did himself no favors yesterday but to an extent i think the media has been hyper critical of him since his presidency started harping on pretty much every mistake or misstep meanwhile giving trump a free pass on his own bullshit that seemed to play out in the debate yesterday too
ok the problem with biden stepping down if people do n't like kamala then we have a problem with black voters who like her so biden leaving race will cause hiccups unless it 's michele obama that 's not gon na work i personally think m obama would never want that job we are in a pickle ride with biden to save democracy
how many politicians do people actually want to vote for do you really think susan collins has stans is chuck grassley exciting does anyone actually know anything about tina smith people vote for people because they trust them to have a competent administration and often times because their opponent seems more dangerous yeah occasionally a politician like barack obama with actual charisma comes along but that 's rare
this is unbelievable wtf happened like 12 hours before that speech night and day
the voters that need to see this wo n't
dude he gave a speech immediately after the debate and it was fine not fantastic but it was leagues better than his performance at the debate like holy shit i 've done 180s before but not like that
it 's kind of infuriating how different and worse he was in the debate holy shit
biden seems to have taken medicine when i take cold medicine i get fuzzy today he seemed to have slept that off
dude where was that guy last night that ’s who we need at the second debate
it ’s not night and day just like the state of the union the difference is this video proves he can read a teleprompter that ’s it he ’s able to read a teleprompter still that ’s exactly why his handlers never want him answering questions from the media that are n’t pre written go back on your own and look at press conferences he ’s done it multiple times he either has his binder with written answers or he has even said “ whatever they tell me ” “ they are working on it ” he ’s a puppet and you ’re trying to convince your brain otherwise
i tuned into this and was like wtf joe ’
to be fair i think more people would be asking trump to drop out if they thought he would actually listen the reason people are putting pressure on biden to drop out is because they think he might have the moral fortitude and wisdom to actually listen they believe that he can see past his personal pride to the wider issues at stake they know trump ca n't as much as it might not seem it that 's actually a compliment to biden 's character
trump answered questions not at this debate he just bloviated nonsense no matter what the question was
we have the minds of goldfish this debate will change nothing and we 'll all forget about it in a week trump is a convicted felon being propped up by a corrupt criminal organization democracy over fascism e'erday
90 minutes let 's relax it was 2 or 3 questions i understand being angry but let 's keep it honest
not just between now and november now and forever forever and ever they ’ll be playing this shit 50 years after biden ’s whole entire family has passed away just to discredit his son ’s dog ’s friend ’s owner ’s cousin ’s daughter
what about people who care about democracy but still believe that biden has a better chance of beating trump than any last minute replacement replacing biden would be a huge fiasco and his replacement might not be able to recover personally i 'd be down with replacing biden if they could smoothly replace him with another candidate who has a much better chance of winning the problem is the only candidate who could realistically do that would be kamala and she 'd lose to trump if they try it with anyone else there would be so much infighting that it would tank the whole campaign
you ’re overestimating the impact of this yes it was a horrible debate performance and the media is hyping and amplifying that guess what the next media cycle is going to be in a couple weeks trump ’s sentencing biden will recover the more trump talks the more people remember how much they viscerally hate him and want to be rid of him the more biden talks the more people realize he ’s old which they already knew
i think the best narrative is that biden ’s age is mostly inconsequential because his role as president is to delegate power to others hopefully experts whereas trump will delegate power to grifters and fascists
you ’re overreacting and doom posting still senile remember hillary won ’ all her debates against trump and still lost
this election has been about keeping trump out of office rather than keeping biden in office since the beginning everyone is panicked about what other people are going to think about biden and whether or not they 'll vote for him without a checking that against their own motivations and b seeing if it 's borne out in the polling repeat after me i am not my emotions
no they should be providing a louder counter voice that says the debate was fine the people who did n't watch it most people should be hearing that it was fine just as loudly as they are hearing that it was a disaster that 's how trump 's team does damage control and it works great
could n’t agree more if there was ever a time for the dnc to put convention aside and take a risk this is it we ca n’t run biden
we have two options run biden and have a 50 50 of winning the election or run someone else and have an almost zero percent chance them 's the breaks
he is not senile and this comment really sounds like hysteria do something now and say to the magats and undecideds our guy was terrible trump won the debate he is the better candidate help us that sounds incredibly weak
you must be young it feels good to shout and yell and do drastic things that 's why people like trump causing damage and chaos is easy but actually producing a better outcome out of it is harder abandoning biden on a whim is not how you beat trump they need to do a lot of maneuvering in the background to come up with an alternate strategy that can actually work not just burn things down in a panic and hope you can get something better after
hillary won the debates with trump how did that work out for her john fetterman had a stroke and said good night as his first words in his debate and mehmet oz polled multiple points ahead of him after it what happened with him
agree the democratic party is delusional right now i am a lifelong registered democrat
replace biden with whom i ca n’t imagine kamala winning but there ’s tangible risk in simply swapping her out or bypassing her would it make sense to replace biden with someone he already defeated in the 2020 primary
hopefully in 2028 we have someone running that is n’t two steps from death
ironically sanders is still mentally capable and would have debated well
sanders would be finishing his 8 year term now if it was n't for these same democrats pulling the rug from under him and also the nation they rigged the rules discouraged young voters made trump president and now they wanna do it again by telling everyone else to get in line rather than do the right thing
you mean convinced everyone else to drop out and endorse biden when bernie won 3 4 of the first 4 states
obama also essentially gave an anti endorsement of sanders and privately called every candidate that dropped out to convince them to endorse biden obama is part of the reason we 're in this mess
nah sanders needed to be the candidate
not a single person or media outlet suggesting biden drop out can give you the name of a viable replacement these people are delusional and think gavin newsome will beat trump this election
it 's ludicrous how many people do n't understand this biden was losing in all 7 swing states even before taking the stage last night
and replaced by whom let ’s remember primary season is over who should be appointed his successor do you kamala can win
yup swing voters will decide this election anyone who dismisses last night as no big deal might as well cast a vote for trump i love and appreciate joe for everything he has done but the time has come to pass the torch
r politics is already elevating a newsweek article saying undecided voters say they now support joe biden after debate when it 's really univision having a focus group of 14 undecided latinos declaring that they switched to biden after the debate this is par for the sub anything negative of biden gets downvoted and anything disingenuously good for biden gets upvoted to the top
“ it ’s all the media ’s fault they want a two horse race the polls are fake news unless biden is ahead ” this board up until last night ’s disaster
nate silver 's blog today was fantastic on this it was basically just a gigantic i fucking told you and all you ' poll unskewing ' fucks were wrong fuck you he 's too old
trump did n't have a good night either he sounded like a lunatic the incumbent advantage is a real thing in that you get what you know vs an unknown in this case known alternative
yes always blame anyone but the establishment democrats always blame progressives the voters am i doing the establishment democrat propaganda right
she had a lot of bad ideas as a candidate is a generally unlikable person and could n’t make it through the primaries in 2020 but was elevated to vp
she 's a cop and she 's weird and awkward when talking bad vibes that 's why people do n't like her
he sounded massively better today but it was in a friendly environment and i got the impression they were managing the crowd to kick chants off whenever he looked like he was struggling
he was reading from a teleprompter though
he sounded great today fiery and well spoken here ’s the video you ’ll feel better about his mental state after watching it if you were worried
he is sundowning it is a common medical issue with people his age
nahh look how quickly people forget trumps missteps or they simply do n’t care oddly enough i think biden ’s faltering performance may have the reverse effect because for now people are focused on biden not on trump it will solidify the support he has and get people to focus on why they support him yes biden is as old af there ’s no denying that but so what he ’s a thoughtful guy who does n’t do well in rapid fire situations if you listen to the actual words not the delivery it ’s clear that biden ’s mental acuity is still there
i have some old people in my family i 'm pretty sure he was operating on lack of sleep and 9 30pm for old folks is like 3 am for most
it still ca n’t compete with a debate where the two are head to head and in the same room and the ratings are very big that was the best chance that biden had to change the narrative he ’s too old and borderline out of it and he merely confirmed people ’s fears he wo n’t get that chance again sadly
i think he backed hillary because that was the deal he made to get her to back him in 2008
the bidens say that to cover for obama beau wanted his dad to run and he made preparations to run read this article
it was actually very sad to see feels like he ’s being forced to run
an entire lifetime of experience
do you know that this is all a popularity contest that 's how this has always worked saying the american people should be better does n't make it so the dnc and biden himself is completely undermining their main message of democracy is on the line by keeping him on the ticket that 's the reality and if they do n't come to terms with that they will lose and fuck us all because of their hubris
they 're absolutely not trump is already publicly considering jailing his political opponents biden and obama will be at the top of that list
gop and republicans are already using the talking points that biden is a puppet which plays into their conspiracy theory of a political swamp to say it would confirm it for people
umm biden had an acceptable sotu speech which surprised people many have been warning us about this for years it ’s only getting worse unfortunately he ran out of time until the election i ’m assuming he planned on passing the baton to harris after winning
killer sotu speech was done with the help of a teleprompter fyi we have n't forgotten we just now see what he 's like when he 's off the teleprompter which is a resounding not good at all so please stop gaslighting us with these whataboutisms i will never vote for trump but it 'd be worth it to remember that biden will be in office for another four years should he miraculously manage to win in november at this point he 's already showing crystal clear signs of old age last night made that very very clear and likely galvanized countless voters that were on the fence about his mental acuity very few people had their confidence restored in his ability to continue killing it i also think it 's rather dismissive to say that nobody will care about this debate anymore when in fact it left a pretty horrible taste in a lot of people 's mouths and would you continue eating something that tasted pretty rancid i 'll vote for him if it comes down to it but i think i 'm done watching him done watching or hearing him say anything that 's not scripted
y’all are n’t hearing me this is n’t about my opinion it ’s about the fact that the coalition of voters that elected biden in 2020 will not give him the same support in 2024 biden won by less than 12 000 in georgia the centrist and independents that voted for him then are not going to support him now he needs black voters to turnout in michigan pennsylvania and georgia to win but no one in the community is excited to vote for him there is no real path to 270 for biden
“ killer sotu address ” my ass people were surprised that he did n’t fumble the bag on a prepared speech he is in decline and it is a problem we need an alternative or we will have trump again
i think the point is you really ca n't have a bad night as much as he did unable to finish thoughts and sentences when you have an important job like being potus the same way a neurosurgeon ca n't have a bad day at the end of the day he is running because his ego is telling him to whether he now puts that ahead of saving the country is the question
80 year olds age 10 times as fast
we all know what a cold looks like what a bad night looks like and what old age looks like this was old age
this we are absolutely fucked might be the last election that the country has
as you also seem to be saying the significance of last night ’s debate should not be understated this was n’t some goof up at a state fair on the campaign trial it was a live debate that was watched by almost 50 million people it was the chance to shut down trump ’s lies in real time make an impassioned plea for reelection and demonstrate competence before the nation none of that happened yeah you can of course do damage control but the election is four months away there ’s not much room for errors like this
yes but he is president he can make lot of official speech
biden is not senile having had two parents with dementia i can tell you that he is old he fumbles he stumbles he misspeaks this is not the same thing as dementia my mother had significant dementia but could fool people who did n’t know her because she could still articulate well but then she would turn around and say something totally crazy and off the wall sort of like trump does now
no did n’t you pay attention biden is letting in millions of murderers and they are killing women and his handling of afghanistan was the worst thing in the history of our country
god damn biden crime family is probably just filling pools and pools up of the h2o
i was wondering why all the water tasted so strange the past few years now i have the answer
fuck joe needs some adderall or something before he debates
could nt they have done this at 3 in the afternoon so the two eighty year old men running for president could be well rested everything has to be primetime 60 second infotainment
i was distraught last night i think it was appropriate for what was on display part of it is that we do not want this country to slide into the hands of fascists the thing is joe admits he 's old that the debate was horrible but he said i know how to do this job he also said i tell the truth goddamn it when as a country are we going to finally put substance ahead of form i 'm sick and tired of liberals who know better worrying about the marketing angle we ca n't stand for values if we let appearances determine choices he 's tired he 's old but goddamn it he 's still fighting and he 's got a huge army behind him does anyone think that biden and his administration ca n't get the job done i mean i personally think biden knows politics better than anyone alive right now he knows how to squeeze meffers he also understands prudence a long forgotten virtue in america marketers are fun but that 's all it is it 's not leadership can we get behind a guy a who actually knows the job got the infrastructure deal done got medical debt and student debt relieved the pact act you name it it 's a shit ton we ca n't fight mainstream media bullshit if we allow their popularity bullcrap to scare us fr fr are we about this democracy or not we ca n't sit here and cry about the democrats now and joe is still rolling real versus fake what 's it going to be old versus liar what 's it going to be wisdom versus smart ass what 's it going to be fuck it whoever whatever whenever trump and people like him are shown i will vote in the opposite direction because we can not go backwards i 'm not going to let them break the spirit of democracy based on looks and for all the people who are scared that independent idiots are falling for trump then make a bigger turnout it 's on us now each person each individual and we need to shut down all fake ass fools who are pushing trump those people want to win at all costs and you know what that 's wrong that 's ceo company draining flop house bullshit that has sucked the life out of this country we the real people need to ourselves on the line to be judged and heckled to push for people to finally vote their interests
everyone pretends joe stepping aside would fix everything but there ’s literally zero evidence of that
yeah biden picking kamala helped him win in 2020 yay but now if biden steps aside kamala would probably lose boo and if gavin was the pick people would say it ’s both racist and sexist boo well this is something we can ponder during the next 4 years of president trump
alot of people were jokingly saying it was past his bed time could that have had even a little bit to do with it or am i just entertaining a ridiculous idea honest question
was n't even 12 hours either he held a rally with voters in atlanta after the debate and was the same joe from the sotu it really does seem like he just had a bad debate which incumbent presidents always do the first debate plus a reported cold and gave a shit performance when it mattered
a speech is rehearsed and normally reading off of teleprompters a debate is responding off the cuff and having to remember facts and figures to cite them
right i feel like he must have just been feeling really shit last night probably had a good nights sleep and got back to it say what you will about the man but he picks himself up and gets back to it when he gets knocked down
what happened was that his handlers who got to make the debate rules completely forgot that biden needs an audience to bounce off and always has just so that they could ratfuck trump
i mean he was giving a speech reading off a teleprompter it 's a little different than actually having to think on your feet and reply with your own thoughts using context also maybe he 's no good after 8 30 or 9 i 'm like four decades younger than biden and i ca n't stay up late anymore like i used to in my twenties and thirties
the difference in all the public appearances which biden seemingly does well is he ’s reading off a teleprompter there s one left and right of the main camera in most of these situations so he can look back and forth to the crowd and it seems semi natural however as we learned at the debate he seems to have lots of cognitive issues conveying complex topics or thoughts when not reading a script this is also the reason he rarely does interviews and none of them are long form trump was on dr phil logan pauls podcast for over an hour of unscripted questions recently worth a watch both hosts extended the offer to host biden but i highly doubt we will be seeing any other unscripted public appearances from him before the election
giving a speech requires reading off a teleprompter a debate requires real time critical thinking skills
spread it around and they might
yeah i mean you could even tell he was starting to come out of the funk as the debate went on real poor timing with the illness giving him that rough start
he gave a prepared speech that lasted minutes debates are not that
he had severe anxiety last night if you have ever overcome anxiety you get it i wo n't excuse it away but i 'm just saying that 's at least part of it
agreed i ’ve given a presentation while fucked up with a nasty cold before and that shit was rooouuugh i feel for the guy
like bro where were you at last night
just to be clear the people asking biden to drop out are pundits media outlets and a very loud group of people freaking out on the internet also some donors that some media outlets report take that for what you will democratic politicians are not asking biden to drop out the facts may change but i think it 's important to state the facts as they are now
well yeah but ca n’t we have democracy over fascism and a strong leader to accomplish it i think that ’s the problem most people are thinking on now it ’s just hard to believe that if the some 350 million americans out there jb is the best pick the dems could find
do you really believe that the man we saw last night could serve as president until january 2029
yeah people are apparently ignoring the fact that the second half of the debate was much stronger from biden
“ and here comes michelle obama from the top rope ” all kidding aside i know she has zero interest in it but in terms of having good popularity and a national household name she ’d fit the bill though i have a feeling it would take joe personally begging her to do it to even have a shot the only other i could think of that ’s a household name polls well with independents and swing voters would be someone like mark cuban i hate billionaire worship like everyone else but we could do much worse at least he pays his taxes which would suck but those two are the only i could think would have a shot starting so late note i would love to see pete be able to run but he would need much longer to convince swing voters
newsom would fall into the john kerry dynamic and losing whitmer or shapiro 's governorships would be a huge blow to the party nationally buttigieg would be good with 4 years of more infrastructure accomplishment everyone else beto who showed potential and held national presence has lost their local elections and been sidelined you know what bring in warren
there is no last minute replacement as that is not a possibility simply because that is n't how our elections work and we are too far into the process at this point no one else is getting on the ballot at this stage in the game you have the choices of trump or biden fascism or an elderly statesmen whose polices in the last 3 1 2 years have not destroyed democracy or the constitution want change elect biden then spend every moment after pushing for a third party candidate that can appeal to both republicans and democrats enough to steal their votes any other suggestion is just a vote for trump and possibly the end of the constitution and what frail democracy we did enjoy
it only works if biden willingly steps down which judging by the campaigns posture today he wo n’t we are totally screwed
calling it a horrible debate performance is underselling it people are concerned about his fitness for office physically and mentally after obama 's horrible debate performance against romney nobody was discussing the 25th amendment
look i do n't think he 's senile and i 'm gon na vote for him but lets also not pretend this was n't very bad one of the single biggest concerns people have about biden is his age last night confirmed all those worries it 's great that he is doing better today but that does n't negate the nationally broadcast debate where people who are not politic junkies were watching
yep they are running for president of the usa not president of the debate club
narrative control only works where the evidence is murky enough to be shaped that debate exposed too many to a man not fit for the office granted it also exposed them to a delusional pathological imbecile but most people make basic decisions based on what it looks like and that was n't a good look
what the fuck do you not see what clips of this will do on social media there is 60 seconds of his dialog that ends with we beat medicare from last night that all but disqualifies him for a second term i am sure he is fine today relieved of the pressure of that debate but he is going to get less reliable not more as time goes on people hearing that last night 's debate was a disaster are hearing the truth give us someone better to vote for
yeah i was shocked by how aggressively the dems on cnn were going after biden only one of them was making a halfhearted attempt to defend him
lol idk how i forgot about fetterman ’s debate
maybe they ’ll give hillary clinton another chance surely this time will be different s
sit down you 're a united states senator convicted felon
sanders also would have better motivated young people to be active in the political process democrats do n’t seem to understand why young voters do n’t pokémon go to the polls
sanders has never been particularly good at debates he just reiterates his stump speech over and over
ca n't even begin to imagine how different the past 8 years would be if sanders had been president this whole time
i think the nevada primary was the last positive feeling i had about anything political in this country
i think gavin could have beaten trump but he needed to go through primary any candidate now “ anointed ” by the democratic convention would piss off voters
the thing about that article is it seems to be based on one tweet saying nearly every single undecided voter said they now support biden not trump but if you actually check the footage you discover that half of the focus group are still undecided on who they 're going to vote for 35 50 for the final vote
this sub always complains about newsweek articles being clickbait garage until they ’re favorable
not to mention this gem buried in the text of the same article in carried out by the new york times and the siena college research institute 45 percent of hispanic people said they would vote for biden and 44 percent said trump in the 2020 election trump received 32 percent of the latino vote up from the 28 percent he received in 2016 biden is hemorrhaging latino voters to the guy who called them all criminals and rapists
r politics elevates dozens of newsweek articles every day sometimes with side by side competing polls saying exact opposite things sometimes with just a couple twitter posts like the one you 're referring to i would n't read much into it one way or another that said i completely disagree with you in that negative biden posts get downvoted there 's literally a dozen sitting up there right now just in the past 24 hours so ya that 's objectively false what ya said
every good poll for biden i saw the top comment was something along the lines of ignore the polls and vote there is definitely an anti pool sentiment but there did n't seem to be a bias that polls good for biden should be taken as gospel
ah yes the incumbent advantage was such a thing in 2020 it 's lookin like grover cleveland all over again
it was also 1 pm not 9 pm dems do n’t wanna accept that trump was right on the money with the sleepy joe monicker
go listen to pod save america ’s latest episode on the debate they mention going to a fundraiser a few weeks back with biden obama and jimmy kimmel and biden was very much the same way he was at the debate they do also mention he just flew back from europe so he could ’ve been tired but overall it ’s not good optics
he does pretty well reading of a teleprompter and he does well in natural conversations it 's when he has to give a memorized answer that he struggles
i do n't care about his mental state i just want a candidate who can beat trump and biden is n't up for it this time that 's what people are worried about winning
it 's not good to have a president that ca n't operate in the evening
cool he can read the teleprompter in a controlled setting during the day
trumps awfulness is already baked in they forget his missteps because they do n't add anything to what they already think about him biden was the one with something to lose last night and he lost it the whole point of this debate was to show general election voters see i 'm not too old and he only made it worse
i do n't thank trump got any support from independents he was talking nonsense and straight up lying he claimed the 2017 nazi rally never happened he claimed the sucker 's and loser was made up he claimed some shit about we have h20 and something about a dog he did n't answer the pill question he talked about covid
he said women are being raped by their in laws and brothers and sisters those were the actual words be for real right now
for republicans sure creating it as a team could change independents
this it ’s not about biden it ’s about the must win situation we are in this is no time for denial
i do hear you and i 'm responding directly to your statements people 's thoughts and opinions about this shit change with the wind it 's not doomsday yet anything can happen
not only that but in my eyes the most damage was done right at the start if he had mental lapses in the middle of the debate which honestly he did too it would n’t have been as bad the first 5 minutes were horrific it got better but damn was there a massive stumble at the start
again they ’re scripted it means significantly less
trump was just saying random shit incoherently yes his voice was stronger but i have no idea what he was trying even to say he was just rambling tbh like black jobs what does the mean
he is old he fumbles he stumbles he misspeaks oh in that case all good
they 're literally dumping their criminals in our country yea right donald go back to your kennel in the kremlin
heck biden is made up of 60 % h2o can you believe the audacity s
that ’s where all the black jobs must have gone s
thanks for the award let 's go
there 's a quote that 's annoyingly true bill clinton was president 30 years ago and is will younger then these guys like bill was a baby boomer bush was a baby boomer obama was a baby boomer the last president to not be a baby boomer was fucking george hw bush that 's a little weird to me that not a single person born in 1970 is n't qualified or able to run on the national stage in their mid 50s in 2024 like what the hell is going on ca n't we have like one 52 year old senator who is skipping his kids highschool graduation instead of his grandchild 's granduation in politics
there 's lots of people who are voting against trump they will vote for anyone who is n't trump biden has those people 's votes but so does any other democrat who is the nominee those are blue votes no matter what the point of replacing biden would be to get additional votes from people who do n't want to vote for someone with severe cognitive decline who are n't excited to vote for biden after the last 4 okayish years where biden was in office if the anyone but trump crowd are sure thing votes and they are and few people actually want biden and they do n't then why not quickly replace him with a candidate that people might actually want to vote for there are lots of potentially decent options like newsom or buttigieg
the dnc had four years to groom a replacement for biden a scramble at the last minute would be a sign of desperation and not inspire confidence
democrats are polling very very well they 're ahead on the generic congressional ballot they continue to do well in special elections and midterms democratic senators are polling way ahead of their gop rivals in states where biden is down against trump by a lot in some states the gap between that state 's democrat and biden is as large as 15 the only way you could feasibly say there is no evidence that biden being replaced would be beneficial is if the only evidence that will make you convinced is an actual parallel universe where that has already occurred
it 's not that it would fix everything it 's that it would break less things if democracy is at stake should n't the best candidate be fielded as opposed to observing deference to party hierarchy
i think he was just a mixture of tired sick overprepared and not quite fully healthy i feel like his strategists sort of overloaded his brain they gave him a lot of lines to say you can tell biden was trying to say them it just did n’t quite come off the way he wanted issue is trump is so unpredictable to the point having lots of prepared lines is borderline pointless i think the bedtime thing could play a part i mean think about it on an average day he probably wakes up relatively early then works all day before at least being able to rest at 8 pm and he ’s 80 i think he ’s still full of energy just look at his north carolina rally earlier today for gods sake the difference was night and day but perhaps he ’s not like obama maybe where he can take a full day of debate prep receive national security briefings and discuss with his ns team then go on stage and debate a lying lunatic for 90 minutes all while dealing with what seemed like a bad cold and relatively little rest during the day and go to bed pretty darn late his debate performance looked terrible yesterday let ’s not get it twisted and it was alarming but i think it was just a bad night when it was a crap time to have it i do still think the discussion is worth having as to whether he should the nominee tho he ’s 80 had a bad debate last night and his poll numbers are n’t great the discussion is worth having i think newsome and possibly whitmer should be on standby ready to campaign at a moment ’s notice if needed
joe biden has more practice than most when it comes to picking yourself back up
tbh we really need a president who is n't gon na get anxiety in front of nobody
which is quite ironic really since the same media outlets and pundits currently working themselves into a frenzy about biden 's incapacity were exactly the same ones hyping biden 's abilities up to the point of sheer absurdity prior to the debate we 're mere weeks past morning joe that joe biden is currently more coherent cogent dynamic intellectual and analytical than he has ever been in his life liberal darlings like joe scarborough and rachel maddow deserve to lose all credibility for the sort of counterproductive twaddle they 've been peddling if they had n't gone so hard on the ' biden has attained an unprecedented level of cogency and anyone who says otherwise is a russian or a trumpist ' guff yesterday 's debate would n't have been anywhere near as newsworthy because the expectation they 'd placed on biden would n't have been anywhere near as high or unrealistic we 've had months of totally counterproductive compensation for the fact that biden is an older man past his prime and now these media darlings are engaged in an existential crisis not so much with biden himself but with the fact they started to believe their own delusional hype the damage their narrative has done is probably far larger than any damage biden himself could have done in the actual debate
this subreddit is american politics but the most generalized and relatively true statement about the eu across the board is post red scare almost every election is between a weak neoliberal and a far right candidate the neoliberals win slightly more because of a do n't you fear fascism and serve generally ineffective and unpopular until eventually the anti momentum gets them deelected and the fascists have a few years going absolutely nuts and alienating even their base and the cycle repeats anything else of course would be communism coalition governments complicate this bit obviously the money never backs anything farther left than the neolibs and that 's what decides wide swathes of elections where you could argue maybe that has happened here before i think america just bought into that same cycle or at least gets to have the just desserts of that neolib left candidate decline
it 's either his old ass or a rapid descent into a christofascist autocracy led by an obese dude with a spray tan so count me in for the old ass man
calvin coolidge was asleep for a significant period of his presidency fdr was physically disabled reagan most likely had early alzheimer ’s late in his presidency debates are tough on anyone let alone an 81 year old sitting president his mind is definitely still there but it ’s very difficult for an 81 year old with a stutter to show it in this kind of format
because one bad debate does not disqualify a candidate
100 % yes it 's not even a doubt one performance where he mumbles a couple of times and misspeaks a couple of times trump has had actual pudding brain for half a decade there 's hours of tapes and thousands of tweets an truths that show he is categorically unfit to serve as president as always has been even if biden literally lost the ability to speak entirely he 's so far ahead of trump in policy record who he surrounds himself with his cabinet picks and appointees that it 's literally no contest the other guy is donald trump how did you forget this and today he addresses those concerns and a bunch of people who personally know the man says it 's not worth worrying about it 's not even a quetsion if yesterday 's biden is the new permanent biden then that 's an issue but 1 instance no how did you end up this reactionary
it would have to be a sitting elected official holding a high office state governor or senator because there is n’t going to be a primary a gavin newsom gretchen whitmer ticket would absolutely excite the base and independents over trump and whatever deranged fascist he picks as a running mate
let ’s just throw the rock in their
i think a few months of tv ads repeating that pete is a christian and military veteran in the right areas and ads repeating that he ’s a brilliant debater and that he ’s young and gay in other areas would have a great effect
if whitmer is popular than her endorsement will carry a lot of water for her replacement just saying i think she 's got way less negatives than the others you mentioned only problem is her name recognition is probably like 2 % though that can change quickly
if we could magically replace biden right now buttigieg would be my first choice warren has most of the same strengths as buttigieg but more liabilities unless you count buttigieg 's sexual orientation as a liability which i guess is an open question newsom is slimy and i think he 'd be a terrible candidate in most years but in a year when so many people are just looking for a mentally competent adult with a pulse he might be better than biden
i 'd love a warren presidency she is so smart and likable sadly her time has passed i think
buttigieg officially lives in michigan now he and his husband brought a house in traverse city which is his husband 's home town i would put large amounts of money that buttigieg decides to run for governor of michigan in 2026 when whitmer 's term is over i 'm pretty sure his and his husband 's decision to make michigan rather than indiana their home was in large part because pete has a much better chance of getting elected to a statewide office in purple michigan compared to red indiana
i think if we were in 22 still pete would be the best option but considering it 's campaigning time i think whitmer or shapiro would be the best options i think they have a lot of midwest name recognition to help secure midwest swing states and i think either one would probably be fine to let their lt governor 's take over
elizabeth warren is 75 years old
no one else is getting on the ballot at this stage in the game nobody has been nominated yet we do n't even know who the republican vp candidate will be there 's plenty of time as far as the mechanics go the problem is that they already had a primary and biden won they 're not going to throw that out unless biden chooses to step aside
it is a possibility if biden steps down and releases his delegates
it only works if biden willingly steps down which judging by the campaigns posture today he wo n’t yes at a minimum he 'd have to voluntarily step down but i do n't think that 's enough there would have to be a clear replacement ready to go with all prominent democrats on board i do n't see that happening
and why would the campaign allude to him stepping down before it ’s official or even decided of course they ’re going to posture today lol
yes he had a bad debate you do n’t suddenly get better though within 24 hours the point of the second clip is to show what he ’s usually like i guess what irks me is we have several examples of biden ’s public speaking this year but this debate performance is being harped as a smoking gun on his cognitive functions partly because it ’s going to make the site a ton of money from panic clicks now everyone is freaking out and it ’s starting to spiral i work in broadcasting and have been assigned to monitor on some of biden ’s stuff i get i ’m forced into a position where i ’m listening to him talk more than the average american and that warps my perspective on him it truly is unfortunate his worst performance i ’ve seen this year was the one everyone tuned in to watch i just think it ’s worth waiting for the second one before hopping on reddit demanding everyone panic and abandon biden or you ’re a moral coward ’
confused biden is already a meme
at this point they literally ca n't i 'd rather vote for the guy who mumbles than the constant liar pushing us towards authoritarian fascism
van jones looked like he was going to cry last night it was the worst possible outcome
it was weird watching the post debate discussion some of them almost shouting about how bad biden did and how democrats were texting them saying “ wtf ” while casually just mentioning that “ yeah trump did nt do good either and nearly everything was a lie or nonsensical ” before jumping on biden again america media weirds me out
well cnn is a right wing outlet
maybe we can also get someone we all can get excited about
young voters never go in big numbers to the polls regardless of who is on the ticket
that ’s funny sanders did n’t motivate them to vote in the primaries for some reason
same here that was the last time i felt actual hope
that 's what i do n't get you have people in this thread still complaining about bernie 's loss in the 2016 primary but think that opening up a power vacuum in the democratic party 5 months before the election would be a good thing
good find i trusted the tweet since i could n't find the source myself
still complaining still clickbait still think it should be banned that said i do find it weird today me being in the chorus suddenly when it 's a rather biden positive newsweek article and here i thought reddit loved joe biden wait no it 's contrarianism that 's what reddit loves forgot
negative articles about the debate are getting through now because there 's been a substantial change in opinions but any polls or articles that were unfavorable for biden were almost always in the negatives anything positive for biden would reach the top of r all even if they were n't accurate
it was actually lol trump was a historically awful president and he had the most votes ever for a conservative president biden just got more because people decided that more of the same was a terrible choice
biden sounded way better speaking to a crowd right after the debate i do n't know what to make of the whole thing
last time everyone voted anti trump not pro biden they ’ll do it again what happened since then trump is now a felon jan 6 happened roe got eliminated trump has other pending criminal trials he was found liable for sexual assault go ahead and freak out about him losing his train of thought like everyone does sometimes watch the speech
possible that he had a fever and the medicine they gave him to not constantly cough and sniffle made him incredibly drowsy still horrible his mouth was constantly open because i imagine he could n’t breathe through his nose regardless he looked like a walking corpse last night today was a complete 180 in nearly every sense
i would that the actual point of the debate was to come to grips with biden ’s age and deal with it what matters not is whether biden “ won ” or “ lost ” the debate what matters is what we decide about that i can only decide for myself i ’m still voting for biden and i know why
i 'm confused do you think that 's not happening or was there a wider quote that that makes no sense in i did n't see that part of the debate
independent here i want a leader not a team
you think i ’m overestimating the situation but you ’re underestimating it do n’t say you were surprised come november
based on context just jobs otherwise held by blacks not specific working areas
not to kink shame but that is the perfect circle for republicans black pool boys who 'll fuck their wives while they watch from the bushes
i actually had to look that up i can barely believe bill clinton was president 30 years ago and right now today younger than biden and trump that 's insane bill clinton is 77 years old trump is 78 and biden is 81
ironically it ’s both our collective expectation of more experience trump and to a much lesser extent obama aside and what it tends to take to move up in politics you can earn these offices at younger ages but someone running for the house who ’s won state wide office has a better shot so they ’re hypothetically now 30 after a few cycles they run for senate after a term in the senate they ’re on to governor and now without even noticing they ’re 60 and maybe thinking about running for president clinton and bush jr only being governors prior was seen as more of a liability than a standard path
well there were a bunch of them coming from the republican primaries in 2016 and they were all idiotic congressmen they screamed at each other on the debate stages like animals then we ended up with trump for 4 years cuz that time people did not have trust in career politicians to run our country people are so easy to forget that timeline and that ’s why we now ended up with biden cuz we trusted him for his records as a vp and a life long senator in his prior years the problem is that kind of boomer generation between the age range of 50s stepped out but not stepped up back then they did n’t understand what the milenials want and now it comes down to the genz biden did try to pull us back and away from the chaose of trump and the extremists but this will be the final warning that we must have better candidates in the future that understand the struggles of the working class shared between millennials and genz
i do n't consider obama a baby boomer and neither does he
there ’s never been a successful late candidate and there have n’t been many at all i believe just two the incumbent vp hubert humphrey being one and he lost to nixon in 1968 no one is going to replace biden now and it would n’t be an easy or clearer path to victory you would run the risk of splitting democratic voters trump supporters are n’t really going to change their mind and few republicans would vote democrat anyways it ’s a bigger risk to dems if they were to swap candidates besides it would most likely be harris because she ’s the easy choice she ’s already vp and there ’s little time left until the election to find another viable candidate let alone campaign harris does not move the needle for some folks either so it ’s not a reliable strategy
the dnc is not a fucking council of wise elders who control the party the dnc is a party apparatus that largely works for the president who is the leader of the party
who would have been the best candidate in your opinion
this is truth i 'll shout it from the rooftops until the day i die the fourth estate has failed this country more than any other group or any one person ever could except maybe donald trump that of course can be traced back along a straight line to the revocation of the fairness doctrine a foul turn of events resting squarely on the back of ronald reagan may he rot in hell to think they could be expected to police themselves as an unofficial branch of our democracy with no checks nor balances absolute foolishness
this is an interesting conclusion i am not up on modern eu politics so thank you
yup give me an old ass man with a good heart over a convicted felon and rapist any day of the week also the convicted felon and rapist is also an old ass man
this messaging will 100 % certainly absolutely lose him the election he won by the tiniest of margins last time remember the popular vote is completely unimportant he needs to win a set of very specific states to secure this election how does he win by 10k votes in georgia again when georgians are going to get 4 months of constant evidence of his senility on display he needs a couple of hundred thousand votes in arizona same thing he never had a guarantee in 2020 and he never had one going into this election stop pretending that the electorate is going to accept this stupid vote the way i tell you to because i said to strategy because wit ha literally never worked in all american history and relying on it now is political suicide
or you know someone else like we 've been asking for
if you ca n’t handle the mental strain of a televised debate you should n’t be president trump literally never could and biden ca n’t now either
well i mean it ’s not like newsom is the most popular governor at the moment plus the work that whitmer is doing in michigan is very important and losing her in that position would be devastating plus idk if whitmer and newsom would want to expend their political capital for a 6 month uphill sprint cause if they lose that ’s it for president for the rest of their careers and both of them probably would n’t want to be vp as that tends to be a death knell for presidential hopefuls but yeah it ’s a tough choice and one the dnc has back itself into a corner for
and a few months of attack ads about the global supply chain crisis and east palestine oh glowing in the dark will have a great effect too
he ’s got the charisma of a dish towel
we do nt need to win over the base all the democrat candidate has to do is to be normal avoid the culture war shit full stop
buttigieg ’s sexual orientation is absolutely a liability i wish it were n’t but we ca n’t pretend it ’s not it ’s not an open question at all there is a significant portion of the electorate including those blocs of people who can ordinarily be safely trusted to vote democrat that would not support pete buttigieg because of his sexual orientation
nothing magic about it he can be replaced at rhetorical convention by a vote of the delegates if he consents to it
how many of the other appearances that he did well at were unscripted if he can only do well reading off a teleprompter that says something
i could n't stand to watch cnn they were covering it like it was a train wreck admittedly it sort of was but they had no real path forward towards unifying the democratic base solidifying support amongst independents compared to msnbc which was all about strategizing the next steps for the biden campaign big picture outlook for the democratic party msnbc did n't downplay biden 's performance but there were n't just gawking at it they were rationalizing it and detailing possible next steps world of difference to what cnn had going on
so if a candidate ran on a platform of education reform housing reform and enacted policies that would help young americans you think they would n’t show up to vote i disagree young people do n’t currently show up to vote because politicians do n’t run on issues that affect this group joe biden is n’t doing anything for a 25 year old that trump is n’t also doing and i fucking hate trump if anything some of biden ’s policies would negatively impact me and my peers i paid off my student debt so why would i be in favor of a candidate that will wipe debt from some people without solving the issues for future generations liberals in america in 2024 are stupidly short sighted and it will cost you another election
let me go ahead and correct and or criticize this statement on a couple points negative articles about the debate are getting through now because the debate was less than twenty four hours ago there were plenty of negative articles about biden yesterday too only they were n't about the debate 'cuz it had n't happened yet first correction criticism second correction criticism anything either positive negative or accurate about biden on r all has nothing to do with the statement that i was responding to you were talking about r politics elevating newsweek articles specifically stating this is par for the sub emphasis mine anything negative of biden gets downvoted
turns out an 82 year old man has inconsistent energy levels maybe this is why most leadership in every day life is generally younger than 65 and has been for all of human history ben franklin did n’t run for president because he was concerned for his age ben franklin died at 84 even if ben franklin was running for president in 2024 he ’d be too old joe biden is no benjamin franklin
biden achieved victory in 2020 through a combination of some enthusiasm for him as a candidate and the fact that trump 's presence and public anxiety was at a fever pitch because he was president at the time neither of those factors are present this time around what will secure trump 's win in november wo n't be an increase of his supporters but the spread of apathy among everyone else after this week that scenario has become a lot more likely
they wo n't unfortunately trump was already ahead in the polls before the debate respite his convictions etc he 's going to get a massive post debate bump it 's over for biden he 'll lose every swing state now he needs to be replaced quickly
those sound like things primarily folks on the left care about except now folks on the left are also becoming no longer a sure thing now we are looking at having to make up two categories of people at least left and centrists moderates let alone gain any ground on the right you 'll get lower turn out on the right for trump but they 'll still typically vote more than those on the left now we 're suffering from leftists being less likely to vote if we do n't get energy in this party within the next month fuck it it 's over trump will win again
yeah but most of us do n't lose our train of thought every single sentence because we do n't have dementia yet
i do n’t know what that guy is complaining about it absolutely made sense in context he was talking about exceptions for incest and rape to allow abortions that republicans do n’t support the only part that does n’t make sense is “ sisters ” since the topic was abortions but that ’s a minor instance of misspeaking under a time crunch and it definitely still happens
fled cruz was born in l970 rhonda was born in 1978 aoc was born in 1989 newsome was born in 1967 whitmer was born in 1971
obama was in the senate for like 5 seconds
no way to know since the primary was effectively stopped by party elders and serious candidates were all dissuaded from running to protect biden now it is even harder to organically select one if biden was to have stepped aside before the primary then it truly would have been a way to select the best candidate
100 % although they like to cosplay as the last line of defence against trump they gave him his greatest ammunition ' fake news ' resonated with people because they inherently recognised that disconnect between what the media promised and what the media actually did like morning joe 's weird insistence that biden had reached levels of intellect hitherto unseen is a recent example of that people see the discrepancy between reality and narrative they resent that obvious discrepancy and then an opportunistic trump swoops in points out the discrepancy validates that resentment and people then somehow imagine that because he occasionally gives them a scathing account of the society in which they live that somehow means he 's ' on their side ' obviously it does n't mean that at all but i feel like we 've underestimated the power of validation as one of trump 's weapons for far too long i know that the media 's incessant boosting of trump has been well accounted for in his rise to power but i often think an overlooked part of the media 's failings with trump is just how often they play to his characterisation of them like you say there 's scarcely a group that has failed america more than them besides perhaps trump
i do n't want an old man with a good heart he has to be damn good at being president too and able to get shit done thankfully that 's joe
i mean how do we even know that he 's an ass man this just seems highly speculative to me
i love the fact us election are decided by swing states which are predominantly small and powerless but the real vote aka popular does n't matter minority rules canada is also the same a little bit shitty election model
little late for that call at this point a new candidate would be handing the election to fatty mcgoo
counterpoint it ’s even more difficult to “ debate ” in his position when an opponent constantly goes off topic and personally attacks you your family etc not to mention lying in every other breath anyone would get thrown off trying to “ debate ” an asshole like donald trump that ’s why he “ wins ” debates and why everyone else sees him as an idiot
whitney i get but the idea that newsome would turn down a run now bc it ’s political suicide is exactly what ’s wrong with our political system to be clear i think you make a lot of sense as to why nothing like that will happen just makes me hate the process and people involved in it a little bit more
it really is crazy that america ’s homophobia would tank a sane candidate over a felon but i feel you ’re 100 % right people would stay home and accept trump over voting for pete and having a first gentlemen
nothing magic about it he can be replaced at rhetorical convention by a vote of the delegates if he consents to it the magic is in doing it smoothly if they just throw it open to a brokered convention all we 'd hear about is the chaos inside the party it would be the biggest scandal of the election in an election with a candidate who was just convicted of 34 felonies the only way it would work would be if biden announced that he 's stepping aside and he 's selected to run in his place and then every other prominent democrat immediately endorses so it 's a done deal unfortunately i think that would only work if it 's kamala and i do n't think kamala would beat trump
it ’s hard to say because he ’s a politician he ’s in talking points mode in most appearances and those are obviously practiced i just think it sounds worse than when obama or harris does it because he is old and talks in a canter you ’d assign to an older person all of these were recent ish but again i ’m not voting for a president for bread and circus speeches
idk why people are still expecting cnn to lean left after their purchase it ’s been pretty clear since then they ’re not anymore
young people have never shown up to vote it 's a big part of why bernie lost primaries they also did not show up for mcgovern in 72 when he ran on a lot of the same policies as bernie
so if a candidate ran on a platform of education reform housing reform and enacted policies that would help young americans you think they would n’t show up to vote so joe biden
what negative articles about biden were getting upvoted yesterday before the debate i looked through yesterday 's posts and the only ones about biden that were upvoted were positive for him while the negative ones were downvoted my point about the debate articles is that there is a clear change of opinion on biden across the board so of course there 's going to be an influx of negative articles about the debate i was talking about r politics elevating positive articles for biden not just newsweek 's i think i know my own point
well to be fair if ben franklin were running today he ’d be 318 years old
so far the indications are that trump is only getting a small bump which makes sense since very few voters are truly undecided biden needs every vote he can get though
lmao at fled cruz i have n’t heard that before
newsom has my vote he 's quintessential gen x not to mention very handsome and astute
there has n’t been a meaningful primary of an incumbent in forever you talk like it was some conspiracy it ’s really easy to take the side of something that will never happen because you can never be wrong
party elders lmao incumbent presidents are never primaried it ’s not some conspiracy get a grip
party elders other candidates did n’t run because running an active primary against a sitting president in your own party would only damage your own party in the long run it is n’t some magic cabal who prevents things from happening
ah ok even as a non american i like to think i follow us politics fairly closely since it affects the rest of us the way so many people are saying he should have stepped down as if there was a promising candidate made me think i missed some important detail thanks for your insight
i 'll take the faded over the fascist
i do n't think this is true another candidate would get the same vote as biden plus some people who do n't like either current candidate
housing has gotten more expensive the last 4 years educated has been steadily deteriorating in quality nothing has been done to help college students afford tuition beyond cancelling debt for a small subset of americans minimum wage has n’t increased in 15 years police budgets increased we beat medicare under biden and trump suicide has been at an all time high in american history so has homelessness and drug addiction and political lobbying has continued to worsen need i go on
i do n't think ya do d
as much as i want this to be right it 's several days too early to know the true impact there 's been like one post debate poll
i think he ’ll be the nominee in 2028 i love how gavin actually takes the fight to republicans he debates tiny boots in florida and goes on fox news i love the fighting spirit but does he stand a chance of beating kamala if biden steps aside i do n’t see how anyone else could get the nomination out of her grasp
you 're right anyone saying it was some sort of coordinated conspiracy by party elders is being sensationalist and i can totally understand the argument that launching a viable primary challenge on an incumbent would risk fatally wounding them without finishing them off allowing them to limp on to certain defeat in november but at the same time i think it 's now clear that not nearly enough regard was given to the fact that biden is the oldest incumbent in history facing one of the most dangerous political opponents in history avoiding any sort of meaningful stress test on his abilities prior to locking him in harness has n't exactly proved to be the wisest course either and to be honest i do n't really blame the dnc for that i blame the media when the likes of morning joe mere weeks ago was evangelising about how biden has never been more cogent more lucid more coherent more intellectual and more analytical than he is now it 's really not hard to see why his performance last night came as a surprise to many people and morning joe was by no means the only one guilty of that if you actually want to see your political candidate run as robust and effective a campaign as possible you 'd rather their deficiencies were found out sooner than later the only saving grace here is that someone somewhere very wisely decided that the debates should take place far earlier than usual i ca n't imagine how genuinely catastrophic that first debate performance would have been if it had come september or october instead of in june
that is only true if they did n't step aside in the first place right if biden would have said i will only finish out this term and retire to be with my grandkids no one would have faulted him and that would have triggered a true primary
housing has gotten more expensive the last 4 years that 's what happens when you have a depressed market and low interest rates from a pandemic and then have an incredibly bullish economic recovery under one of the most effective presidents in living memory educated has been steadily deteriorating in quality not for lack of biden trying nothing has been done to help college students afford tuition beyond cancelling debt for a small subset of americans again not for lack of biden trying minimum wage has n’t increased in 15 years not for lack of biden trying police budgets increased police are not federally funded we beat medicare i ca n't take your comment seriously after this biden literally ran on and is running on a platform of education reform housing reform and policies that would help young americans you asked for such a candidate and you fucking got one
sure but that ’s not what happened if the incumbent runs for a second term they almost never get primaried and no incumbent has ever lost to a primary challenger
so the starving have joined the ranks of the drunk
trump putin and kim jong un three great war criminals just ratcheting up the kill count
n korean missile ha that was a 5th gen n korean trash balloon their artillery shells and missiles do n't work but they have the best trash ballons in the world
yeah just like it was irrefutably proved that iraq had weapons of mass destruction
north korean artillery shells do work but they have a very high failure rate something like 1 in 4 fails to detonate on impact and 1 in 40 suffers a catastrophic failure that spoils the artillery piece with a couple incidents of shell detonating in the barrel but when you are firing a thousand of these shells at a location even with those failure rates you are still causing devastating damage edit interesting fact after the korean and vietnam wars the us started a program to bring the dud rate of their munitions down to less than 5 % the reason for the change in policy was because duds are still dangerous years after they have been fired and can detonate and maim innocent people years after the war had finished
except north korea and russia have a formal pact and have you know announced themselves that nk was providing missiles and shells
does anyone remember trump will be receiving his sentence for his criminal conviction in less than 3 weeks
i just love the phrase raleigh rally
but not as many people will see it
i wish he would have shown up like this last night one debate should n’t determine an election but it was a particularly terrible moment to show up the way he did that being said president biden is a good man a good president and someone who loves his country and wants to protect the people in it mr trump is a rapist and an insurrectionist and his ideas and platform are a danger to the american people good day or bad i am with biden it ’s carter or reagan all over again and we ca n’t make that same mistake
but 49 million people were n’t watching
he flubbed when it mattered then had a better performance when it did n’t matter
raleigh rally noice he was a different person tonight some stutters but full of piss and vinegar how i like my malarkey
he has it in him he just failed to deliver when it mattered i 'm not buying into the calls for replacement because i ca n't see an alternative candidate getting enough support in time at the end of the day we 're voting for an administration not just a president the debate solidified my doubts about biden 's ability to continue for 4 more years but i 'm still voting for him because i 'm confident in what his vp can accomplish if his strength fails completely
“ bad debate ” is putting it lightly is n’t it
biden “ did you see trump last night ” everyone “ no we saw you ”
how is this the same person from last night
if biden is the nominee trump will win face reality
he gave a very solid speech there fluid energetic even fiery i 'd recommend it to anyone it 's just so sad that he could n't come out in this shape for the debate for whatever reason
biden made more money today than any prior day in this race suck on them apples republoseicans
anyone who thinks this can erase last night 's performance is being incredibly niave
i ’ll still vote for him but jesus is he old that shit last night was so cringe he reminded me of the old guy that ran the art shop in bobs burgers sure he ’s tough today but we needed him to be tough yesterday he charlie browned trump is in his glory right now and that makes me puke next debate screw camp david all that rehearsal messed him up wing it drink water keep your mouth shut stare at the camera and shake your head while he talks quit the canned insults hire a comic to write your insults instead of your lame debate squad cheat write shit on your hands like we all did in college he s going to eat you up again unless you flip your script
the difference a simple prompter can do
too bad 51 million people are n't watching it like they were last night
there is unfortunately no real bouncing back from last night unless they prove that was a deep fake during the debate the content of his speech was irrelevant he does not look competent to be a wal mart greeter i 've already said it elsewhere but the argument for biden 's fitness can not rest on trump 's badness we are in a sorry state politically and the further down the road we go with him the worse it will get better course correct as soon as possible
biden finishes a scentence and its headline news
y’all that clip of this that is going viral bout moved me to tears he ’s gon na be ok
variation of the title grandpa had a good day today
presidents have speech writers these words could very well have been written for by directly practiced and up in front of him when they were delivered that is not how real world situations go and biden showed last night that he ca n't handle the real deal i 've seen my middle school students make great speeches live in the moment is something different
i assume he has confidence monitors when giving a speech
its quite misleading to not mention here just like in almost all his other speeches he uses a teleprompter while at the debate we got to see the real unaided biden minus the help he required to get down the stairs safely at the end
this is a great speech everyone should watch it
too late well has been poisoned one mistep in the future and he 's cooked get newsom in there if this election is as important as the dems are claiming put someone in who can win
that 'll stem the bleeding at least but it wo n't be enough to totally reverse the damage not yet at least
there is not bouncing back we saw what we saw joe is toast
he needs to decline the nomination if we wanna win in november
looked like he got over that “ cold ” pretty quick
r politics is so biased in their coverage of this i can not even believe it ’s allowed to exist with a neutral name like that
i feel like there should be a term for when old people are normal and energetic earlier in the day then later in the evening after the sun goes down they are incoherent and agitated really wish there was a word for this specific condition smh
my take on president biden is that he was tired i bounce back too when it 's all said and done president biden is aligned with our nato allies and trump is aligned with our enemies
holy shit he was less than 5 miles from my place today damn wish i had heard about this sooner
the news cycle will move on from the debate just like it does everything else america ’s attention span is horrible biden just has to move forward and focus on what he ’s done and what he will do and how trump winning will very well mean the end of free elections
i do n't know what people were expecting from the debate i was n't expecting biden to pull anything like his sotu speech it 's a completely different format speaking from prompt as opposed to taking questions and answering off the cuff are two entirely different animals especially in the presence of a raving lunatic
please do not bounce this man you will shatter every bone in his body
perfect city for a raleigh
the only people who care about a debate results as away of determining who they ’ll vote for are idiots or undecided voters who at this point are idiots this is n’t a wrestling or boxing match this is n’t a football game one guy has been a decent president for 4 years with policies in his resume that helped the american people the other was a disaster anyone who was pro biden and is doubting that after the debate was n’t pro democracy pro policy or pro helping american people
glad to see he 's on damage control big road ahead of him scripted speeches earlier in the day are great but he needs to show voters that he can think on his feet if he ca n't think on his feet then he 's in trouble trump is a fucking monster but he 's like a circus ring leader or one of those snake oil salesman he 'll make you give him your wallet and let him fuck your wife and you 'll think it was your idea biden needs to come off fighting if possible if this is n't possible well then i sadly see trump winning
a raleigh rally rebound really
people who think biden should keep running after last night are delusional imo like as delusional as the people who think trump is a saviour figure biden could n't complete a 1 and a half hour live debate without looking weak tired and confused he 's applying to be president of the untied states again for another four years this man does not have the ability to do the most stressful important job in the world for another 4 years he is not fit for the job and needs to go he needs people to be honest with him and convince him to step down the country needs it its not about whether you would vote for biden over trump every democrat would its about what the millions of other americans who do n't see biden as a good candidate will do some small amount might vote for trump but realistically most of them wo nt but they might just stay home in large enough numbers to hand the election to trump biden continuing on is not selfless public service it is selfish hubris
he is going to need to do even larger rallies everyday and a lot of public interviews to erase what we all saw in the debate not saying he and his campy ca n’t but it ’s certainly an up hill battle now
and millions of viewers did not see it so go luck with that
biden needs to be bubble boy the week before the next debate so he is n’t sick or whatever his problem was
if there 's any state to flip to dem nc is next i just hope they can pull it off
i wish trump was to get prison at his sentencing alas that wo n’t happen and would be a logistical clusterfuck but still
biden bounces back from bad bate with rousing raleigh raleigh
and where the fuck was this level of energy during the debate honestly i 'm still so pissed at that his poor visual performance at that debate might very well be the deciding factor in the destruction or protection of democracy in america if he 's staying in this race he better pull the dark brandon persona on full time against the gop and never hold back like that again
if biden truly believes this election is about us and not him he needs to step aside choose a successor and bow out with some grace and dignity while there ’s still time refusing to do so will cost the dems this election plain and simple
bounces back i watched the rally biden read from a teleprompter the entire time are we kidding ourselves this was not a “ bounce back ” this was an entirely scripted 20 minute excerpt
bad debate because he was n’t an incoherent raging lying psychopathic lunatic fucking news media has to gin up bullshit to get clicks rather than report on what actually happened they ’re complicit in the next attempted insurrection ffs
nobody is watching his raleigh rally
idk if there ’s any bouncing happening from him
the opinion of the debate biden lost give the particulars of this event a week or two to distill one man took the event seriously and stumbles the other just tones down his “ rally delivery ” that distinction i think will be given to this debate a thoughtful candidate versus a blow heart
heres the thing i do n't care need my leaders greatest skill being able to pull zingers at will against their political opponents i want someone who makes sound policy decisions and knows how to choose competent and not corrupt staffers if everyone looked at it this way trump would nt stand a chance in hell unfortunately people seem to be drawn equally to confident and competence probably preferring confidence regardless of the competence which is why humanity continues to struggle against some relatively straightforward challenges
it 's kind of ironic that the people who just a short time ago would have stated their political core was to eliminate control over things by a smoke filled room of white men are now begging for a figuratively smoke filled room of white men to bail out their political cause maybe this room does n't exist i see current events as the consequence of the left attacking the very notion of nuanced rational thought that considers multiple angles and multiple iterations of consequences instead the emphasis has been on lizard brain appeals to just one idea and anyone who says the slightest thing questioning whether this idea can be achieved must be silenced the time to have switched to another candidate would have been a year ago with president biden agreeing to be a one term president as of now simple rational thought at multiple levels shows there is no alternative to joe biden and kamala harris as the ticket there just is n't even if joe biden were to bow out this instant who exactly is the obvious successor why would n't that successor be kamala harris how do you put together a ticket without kamala harris that does n't alienate the voters she is supposed to appeal to but can one argue that kamala harris is any better a candidate than joe biden against trump right now no you ca n't argue that that is sheer nonsense what is disgusting is that now now when it is way too late now is when the mainstream media such as cnn the new york time and the washington post are dogpiling on questioning joe biden 's fitness to be the candidate where were those organizations months if not years ago pointing out the same problems this is the consequence of the left promoting an environment where anyone who steps out of line is to be attacked without limits in an attempt to destroy their career the result is that mainstream media can not do their jobs so we have them waking up only at the worst possible moment when nothing can be done moving as a irrational pack
calling that a “ bad debate ” is like saying damar hamlin had a “ bad game ”
it 's wild watching the news orgs do this slow pivot from we need to talk about other options to he can still do it it was just a bad night the media organs were in total panic mod last night but now this like what happened are we supposed to believe the whole it was a cold spin it 's all so unconvincing and the change in messaging feels really forced the wheels came off on live tv blew apart the notion that clever editing makes biden look the way he does and now we 're being asked to pretend it did n't happen this is an incredibly important election and they 're going to risk it all for the ego of one powerful but rapidly deteriorating dementia patient are they too scared to consider what few paths they have left to beat trump or too lazy
reminds of my 50 m race i finished in 6th position i did an ok job in practice two days after my mom saw me and told me i 'm her champion thanks mom
this is a desperate take
i also find it funny that everyone has forgotten all the crazy shit trump spews at his rallies bc biden had one pretty awful night i mean trump was fucking nuts at the debate but he 's crazier when he 's in front of his cult members biden 's team needs to put out some supercuts of trump 's incoherent ramblings there 's plenty out there
it 's just amazing to me what the dems have been through in the last 24 hours 1 panic and disaster that was the worst debate ever biden did horrible 2 we need to replace biden he ca n't possibly win against trump 3 we 're definitely going to replace biden we just need to step down 4 biden refuses to step down 5 biden did n't do so bad trump lied way more they realized they ca n't replace biden so they 're gon na glue those big cheerful smiles on their faces and eat the turd sandwich before them just like they had to pretend they were stoked about hilary going up against trump the first time
maybe between this and the cavalcade of horrors emanating from scotus the news cycle will move on from last night quickly
obama ’s 1st debate when running for reelection against mitt romney was crap as well yet he won handedly let ’s see the second debate before coming to any real conclusions but honestly i do n’t see how anybody can be undecided already by this point
because he has dementia does these symptoms look familiar lewy body dementia symptoms include fluctuating attention alertness these shifts can last hours or go on for days the person may stare into space appear lethargic or drowsy and have hard to understand speech appearing a lot like delirium at other times the person may have much more clarity of thought
i was annoyed biden 's voice was so raspy but i still think he won the debate you have to actually answer the questions to win
honestly he was n’t even that bad at the debate least he said something of substance trump just avoided and lied
47 million less people saw it
this brought tears to my eyes i 'm not old but i can only imagine how he felt last night if not for a long time but probably just a moment everyone including me said he 'd let us down and it was a bad debate he came off horrible but the fact that he 's back up and fighting seeing him stay the course people chanting four more years god damn it i really felt touched he might be old but he ai n't weak i do n't give a shit how he looks or sounds he 's pushing for substance over bullshit i hate to say it but he believed in himself when for a brief moment we all did n't that 's a hero
this needs to be every two days and hit trump hard at each one also trumps environmental numbers were probably helped because he fucked up the covid response so bad the shut downs lasted way longer than necessary meaning hardly any planes or car travel
i wonder how much of biden ’s poor performance last night was due to the relative lateness of the debate most older people get up quite early and are almost toast by 9 pm just wondering
biden had one of the best presidential debate performances ever yesterday where are people getting this
millions of people watched him struggle last night but i ’m sure he did great 24hrs later when no one was watching lol
biden 's rally in raleigh was more than just a campaign event it was a testament to resilience and leadership despite facing tough moments in recent debates biden showcased his ability to bounce back with vigor and determination his speech resonated with a renewed sense of purpose addressing key issues from healthcare to climate change with clarity and conviction this rally was n't just about rallying his base it was about reaffirming his commitment to fighting for every american regardless of the challenges he faces on the debate stage
he only looked good because he was able to read off a teleprompter which he was n't last night or if he was he needs to get a bigger teleprompter
unfortunately rallies are watched even less than the debates he 'd have to do a dozen of these to make up ground for it and that 's a dozen chances for him to slip up and the feeble joe to come out to play
raleigh rally 3 times fast is something neither candidate can say but at least biden will know what he ’s trying to say wish he ’d pass the torch
too bad the rally was n't nationally televised
republicans drugged him for the debate trump was talking about it for two weeks wake up libs
that of course no one saw
i member will probably be a big news day week going into the convention curious how soft merchan will go on him give how soft he was with the 10 gag order violations
and a week after that the olympics kick off which will suck up all the air time
yeah i think people read way too far into the debate performance i 'd rather biden make his errors this early and shake out those yips i mean i wish we had a better choice but here 's your local socialist begging you pleading you to be pragmatic and participate in this election we have the choice between a convicted felon with a fascist agenda and the continued existence of our democracy a choice between hatred and brotherhood a choice between outlooks on what society should look like you can have absolute power or you can have freedom you can not have both and anyone who says you can is selling you fear and lies
i keep hearing all these big brain democratic pundits sayings biden should consider stepping aside “ for the good of the country ” how about the fucking convicted felon and sex pest step aside for the good of the country nah that ’s just too much to ask dems need to be the adults in the room while the gop runs the antichrist
he 'll have a fine added to his tab that he has no intention of paying so what
he 'll get probation or a suspended sentence and a monetary fine he 's not going to spend any time in jail
please let it be jail time i would be soooo happy
i 'm looking forward to it
week before the rnc i believe so like 2 weeks ish
he very well could get 6 months which makes two states automatically disqualify home from being on the ballot one if those states is florida lol
i do i kind of want tacos and a watch party
i member it seems like a bowl of post nuts and bonch that he is even able to be on the stage and sugar on top that he ’s still lying about the things he ’s about to be convicted of this is truly the era of unh brother wat is that we have surpassed the rick roll
if we remember here 's my
so if he does end up going to prison but somehow gets elected if that ’s even possible what happens then does his sentence get commuted and he ’s just released i did read that secret service agents will have to go to prison with him lol
not if he is given immunity this monday he is the chosen one s
do people still think this matters his numbers post conviction have only increased the voters have made it clear that the sentencing will be irrelevant
and he 'll have to pay some money the dude is n't spending any time in prison
yes i 'm sure trump receiving a small fine will have a huge effect on this election he did n't lose support from any of the other awful shit he 's done but being assigned a fine by a manhattan judge over financial reporting irregularities will totally sink him
he will get a 50 000 fine
raleigh was built for rally 's
the average independent voter does n't watch a second of the 24 hr news channel nor spends their spare time in political subreddits many of them are going to vote for different reasons and i feel that at the end of the day the fact that trump is a facist wannabe dictator and convicted felon will probably end up 14th on their list
true but if we want to point people to the facts and have them covered then this helps
well then it 's on us to spread this
i mean i doubt all that many people watched the debate either
momentum will grow a leader who came off that bad publicly and gets back up to fight that says a lot
no one watched the debate only around 48 million world wide
it was broadcast live on both cnn and msnbc do n’t know about fox
and people do n’t care that ’s why rallies are all rah rah people tune in for the debate to see how exactly their brain and points of views are working with out teleprompters without anything fake
yeah true we are judged on our most important days it was horrible
51 million people watched that debate probably more a random rally is only seen by a few of those that bothered to show up this was a huge disaster that ca n't be swept under the rug but the conversation will only go anywhere with the polls if his polls dip and if nyt and cnn who think he should drop actually poll potential candidates that could replace him there might be some hope
i do n’t see how biden fumbling a debate can be a deal killer this speech obviously shows he ’s still got some sharpness trump is a nightmare let ’s not forget what he ’s done 1 lost the election and lied about it 2 sent an armed angry mob to congress and told them they need to fight like hell 3 approved of the mob saying “ hang mike pence ” 4 was found liable for sexual assault 5 was found guilty of defrauding his university students 6 was found guilty of inflating his assets to get favorable loans 7 admitted to walking in on pageant contestants dressing rooms 8 raped and beat ivana trump 9 stole from a kids ’s cancer charity 10 received 413 million inheritance despite claims that he ’s a self made man 11 blocked his chronically ill infant nephew from getting any of that inheritance 12 is the first president to receive votes against him from his own party during impeachment 13 led us into being one of the worst hit during covid despite our head start and resources 14 said the democrats do better with the economy 15 was ranked as the worst president in history by presidential historians 16 pushed a plot to have fake votes created and then used to make him president despite losing the election 17 ordered republicans to block a bipartisan immigration bill so biden would not get a win before the election 18 is a convicted felon guilty of falsifying records to influence an election sources for any provided upon request
precisely we needed this biden last night hopefully the next debate will still happen and we ’ll see this biden debate i just hope it ’s not too late for those who were convinced about this acuity last night
this is what i was thinking what if that debate sorta helps biden because he sounds genuine while trump still just sounds off the rails
yes it was unfortunate we need to see past it he is not a perfect candidate but he is a damn good one
the content of the answers is what mattered most to me yes biden showed his age and had a cold but at least his answers were what we expected to hear mostly as opposed to the orange clown who did n’t even answer any of the questions just lied through his teeth biden ftw
carter lost pretty dramatically to reagan what the hell are we talking about
no they were just seeing the press fallout and memefied outtakes
4 months still this is n’t a breaking point
when it mattered care to show me what elections flipped due to a debate they ’re nearly always meaningless to actual end results
tbf how would any other sane person handle being in that ' debate ' against trump 's constant unchecked lying rambling felonious smelly ass
i have argued my maga family members for months that biden is mentally fit after the debate i can not do that anymore in good faith when he said he defeated medicaid he ended his chances of election stop gaslighting and join the call to get someone who will be here in 4 years
this is like someone missing the catch at the superbowl then reporting hey i caught it today in practice the next day
this is where i ’m at people think another candidate can completely disrupt their lives and their families hire a campaign staff get on the ballot in all the states schedule all the campaign stops and media events two of the candidate names being pushed are both active governors who have responsibilities and somehow capture the voting public and democratic delegates in four months i do n’t think that s a winning strategy
people claiming biden should step down are living in a fantasy world the amount of work he had to do did in his political history to get the support of so many crucial areas would get washed away in an instant i would love one of the younger dem candidates to be president but there is n't a single one who would keep all the crucial groups that biden attracted in 2020
kamala harris said the president just had a slow start
apparently everyone is ignoring the fact it was late he is old he has a cold and a life long stutter he was coughing and holding back coughing all night he was hoarse from coughing he probably is actually on better cold meds today
reading is much easier than constructing your own sentences on the fly
and none of the rising stars who 'd have even a shot at winning would consider running right now campaign trail is one thing they 're also facing political violence as a real possibility as is a gop controlled congress plus the scotus
wow he delivered a rehearsed speech fed to him by a teleprompter totally makes up for his vacuous corpse like display last night when he had none of those crutches lmao
he needs a teleprompter as he proved last night he ca n’t communicate without it he had more than 7 days of prep for that debate it ’s very sad
he had a teleprompter and did n’t have to directly interact with people so yes he does well in staged events this is a five alarm fire
we ’re trying to help him pay for whatever drugs trump gets
that make you feel better about the global embarrassment that happened the previous day
i 'll still enthusiastically be voting for biden over the narcissistic compulsive liar who has been adjudicated to be a sexual abuser defamer fraudster and felonious election interferer
4 months will do that alone so much time left
and anyone who thinks last night is irreversible damage is being incredibly pessimistic still have 4 months to change the narrative
it ’s still eye opening though is n’t it his problems does n’t appear to be cognitive he just ca n’t do tv acting he could n’t replicate this on a stage speaking to only a camera and two dead eyed “ journalists ” with no live audience it ’s unnatural and telling he ’s not a pretender he ’s better when he ’s talking in a natural setting to real people and not only to people who like him either he can even do this in front of a congress full of people who hate him edit that cnn debate was awkward and disturbing before either of even started speaking no greeting or handshake between candidates or with the moderators no one in the audience to interact with everyone just take your places like a robot and start the performance no genuine human emotion whatsoever where does one even get the energy to be big hearted in an inhuman sterile environment like that
smfh absolutely a million bounce back points so full of it biden gave an absolutely electric speech during the state of the union but people let it slip out of mind because it was months ago 4 months still plenty of campaign moments relax
lmao the bounce back is the fact that people hate trump more than they hate biden they know trump is a criminal and will just bring in four years of chaos they will be reminded of that every time trump speaks or does a town hall interview i 'll take well intended slow response grandpa over criminal conspiracy grandpa anyday and i think most voters will too
literacy lessons from you about scentences
just wait till trump begins his sentence
the bar for biden is very low lol
could you post that clip itself here for us
yeah i 'm sure he 'll be fine i 'm more worried about our country
i agree with you fluidity and thinking on your feet is key with giving off the presence that you are sharp and able for the job i do feel that biden could not keep up in live time and trump found this out rather quickly and took advantage of it as a downside to this trump did tell a national audience that democratic states kill babies after birth and biden created more black jobs so there is a down side to being quick yet not sharp as well as a down side of being sharp and not quick
and biden showed last night that he ca n't handle the real deal nah if you want to talk history lets talk about all the great things he 's been doing for the working people lately despite the supreme court and half of congress trying to stop him he was horse at a debate that was poorly moderated as his opponent stood there and screamed a tantrum of rage and lies
you mean presidents write words and read them the horror
we disagree on the candidate replacement choice but man you ca n’t frame a campaign around defeating an existential threat to democracy and continue to run biden after last night they clearly are n’t taking seriously how catastrophic last night was
newsom is an establishment prick which is one of the few things that maga trumpists and progressives can agree upon he will be a repeat of hillary
if this election is as important as the dems are claiming its important for us not them they will continue to be owning and managerial class they will continue to get cushy campaign and consulting gigs the party will rake in donations for another 4 years of toothless pseudo opposition we will be fucked
there ’s still trump ’s new york sentencing to help
oooh there starting to be one that i think gets at what you ’re talking about “ cognitive sundowning ” is what we ’re starting to call the observation that especially among older folks and people with alzheimer ’s memory and cognition are often worse in the evening night hours neuroscience is still trying to figure out why but you ’re not wrong to be thinking along those lines
yep it ’s gon na be a rough generation if the dnc keeps up with this course
obama did n't shit the bed this hard
obama has charisma joe biden does n't
and i wish the media cared
agreed but the media is trying to pull a coup
hero what a pollyannish twist who is he saving except his own greed and ego he has been in politics all his life ditto majority of dems in leadership they practically want to cling on to it till death remember the senator from california what ’s difficult with stepping down and letting the next generation step in what brilliant ideas does he have that are so unique to him that other democrats do n’t have this is no more than manifest greed
the evidence of our eyes and ears biden did about as well as nixon versus kennedy can he recover he ’s got a good chance of doing just that and he ’s got good people supporting him but it ’s intellectually dishonest to pretend that debate was among anyone ’s finer moments
got ta work those google search algorithms eh
man i want what you ’re smoking
gj on that comment nailed the script word for word
this ai bot needs to be downvotted to eternity
he ’s reading off a fucking monitor the man can not make a decision to save his life
it actually got an abnormal amount of coverage
i think merchan ’s incredible leniency was to ensure this case could not be won on appeal it ’s frustrating absolute bullshit that trump gets away with this but maybe the long game and giving him enough rope to hang himself with will be the right move as the convention hype starts ramping up so will his anxiety about sentencing and we ’re gon na see some pretty unapologetic bs from trump i hope it buries him at sentencing
just discovered david pakman not sure what his reputation is or if he 's got major flaws i do n't know about but he gave a pretty cogent explanation theory of merchan 's choices with the verdict against prison trump 's an elderly first time offender in the eyes of the law and only 10 % of these crimes are slapped with jail time for prison technically since he defrauded an entire electorate his crime has 300 million victims which would probably rank this crime in that top 10 % also the defendent has shown zero remorse and publicly denounced the court and the judge and repeatedly violated a gag order and held shit stirring press conferences directly outside the courtroom the judge will recognize there is subzero chance of reforming this person or inspiring contrition pakman 's bet he gets a prison sentence but it 's suspended barring any other criminal activity
he went as hard as he could without putting him in prison for the trial
i ’m keeping my expectations to fines and nothing more
he 's a hero he was down and out last night everyone gave him an out and he 's back up and fighting that 's a hero four more years hell yeah
i 'm definitely voting for biden regardless of any debate performance i think it 's telling that the only negative thing the press has to run with is his age even faux news has had to admit the wins for the biden admin i suffered through 8 years of reagan although i was young at the time and 8 years of dubya the magats can survive 4 more years of biden trying to make a positive change for those of us below the 1 %
this is n't making errors or having a bad debate performance people like obama romney gore etc have had off nights at a debate this is him not passing the incredibly low bar of looking like he knew where he was or what he was saying i am praying he either drops out or if he does n't that he still somehow wins in nov but the gaslighting by many is headscratching you can 's spin what everyone saw unedited in real time
obama did absolutely horrible not as bad as this but really bad for a young man in his first debate against romney the good news is trump did n't so much win this one as biden fumbled it biden is good for a second it just hurt sooo much to watch that there 's a lot of collective trama coming out
ngl i did n't even stay up to watch it because of how meaningless a debate in june for an election in november is
bro this is cope he just gave trump ads fodder for months there 's no coming back from this and he was already losing going in dems need to pick a new candidate and do it quickly and get every motherfucker on board and the choice you are presenting is clearly not representative of many people no one not already strongly backing biden believes this they only care that rent prices are fucked and their grocery bill are 40 % higher than when the other dude was in office we need to talk to them on that level cause it 's all that matters to them the save democracy tack is covered
why is it too much to ask the democrats to run someone who could beat trump biden is losing the swing states it 's not about being an adult it 's about winning but democrats do n't actually want to win if they 're the minority party then they do n't have to do anything and they 're corporate owners are happy they can just sit back and whine about not being able to do anything and raise money
like the fact that trumps not only not disqualified but is actually the favorite is the fucking point is n't it this is n't about being the adults in the room it 's about keeping the wolves out if trump is the threat we all believe he is we ca n't just roll biden out there and cross our fingers he was losing before the debate and now he just played right into trump 's hands by looking like the lost old man he 's been framed as what 's important is winning and biden is simply a liability at this point it 's not too late to pick a viable candidate and actually try to win
0 % chance this happens he is n't spending a day in jail
yeah some are still clinging to the delusion that trump 's legal troubles will sink his campaign somehow even though that ship sailed a long time ago
house arrest at the absolute worst and he 'll still be able to campaign in many states since almost no republican governor would allow for the house arrest to be enforced
but do they really have a rally ’s
well concerns with our democracy 's safety is in the top 3 most important issues with exit pollers and focus groups for the past 2 years a recent survey reaffirmed this so people are paying attention to the high stakes more than we actually realize they just are n't chronically online the way we are but we shall see in the next few months lawd jesus
this debate will be clipped into tiktok memes and live online until the end of time
yea they re all on tiktok now and conservatives are crushing it on tik tok
many of them are going to vote for different reasons online ads youtube facebook reddit tiktok where ever i turn my ad blockers off and i 'm fucking flooded with radical right wing ads everywhere it 's been this way for years some random 22 year old that spends half a day on instagram gets exposed to a ridiculous amount of right wing propaganda that boomer that spends half a day on facebook gets spammed with right wing facebook groups and ads
he lost a lot of low information swing voters last night and he wo n’t get them back enough to maybe cover the spread the ship just barely scraped the iceberg we ’ll be okay nothing to worry about but here put on this life vest and make your way to the upper decks
what would really help is biden dropping out
how about he announces he ’s stepping down
i ’ve commented it a few times i think more people need to see it made me feel a lot better about his mental sharpness
100 % most voters live in a bubble and the best way to spread news like this is sharing with people you know instead of just hoping they watch the news or read a specific article talking to friends and family about politics is probably the best way to convince them to vote for your candidate
51 3 million viewers combined over the various networks according to nielsen
people who did n't see it got to see the clips and memes instead it 's not good
definitely agree with that second part character should matter more than it does
even more will see the headlines and high lights world wide
biden fumbling a debate can be a deal killer it wo n't be though it felt like it last night nbsp for better or worse people have terrible memories and this debate was n't nearly as big a deal as cnn wishes it was and we 're still in june if this debate is even the 10th thing in voters heads by november then the biden campaign will have completely failed nbsp all biden and his campaign needs to do is keep driving ahead and work even harder to put biden out in public he wo n't always be great but he will have really good moments like this raleigh speech trump is a disaster candidate the calculus remains that it 's really fucking hard to vote for a convicted felon who most people hate
it is n’t a deal killer if he had been debating a normal candidate it might have been but trump literally did n’t answer a single question and lied basically the entire time it is a moment that biden can overcome and if it is a wake up call for him maybe it can even be turned into a positive over the next 4 months i am hoping his admission about how it went will make him way more open to getting out in public more doing interviews and giving rally speeches and meet and greets he is very good at those things we need to see a lot more of him as scary as that may be for people to hear after last night the worst thing he could do is hide himself away even more now
why stop at 18 that list could keep going for a while
the debate was a deal killer because biden looked and sounded frail he spoke in a meandering way that people myself included had difficulty following when his biggest electoral liability is people think he 's too old and senile his debate performance played into existing concerns about that last night 's performance convinced me that biden should step aside i say this as someone who has been overall pleased with what biden has accomplished so far the reason for biden to step aside is precisely because trump is so awful and the stakes are enormously high whether you think it 's fair or not biden 's performance substantially increased the likelihood that he loses we need someone on the ticket who has a better chance of winning in this pivotal election
i do n’t see how biden fumbling a debate can be a deal killer ah but you see the double standard that is widely accepted around these parts means that any democrat has to be absolutely perfect any less than that and it 's a mortal sin while any republican they 're up against can burn down the house with children in it and they 'll just get a shrug and whatever biden did n't act like trump and yet somehow that is a crime
yea but he hates brown people s
sorry this list is absurd you did n't even mention the georgia phone call arguable the thing that was the most direct attack on democracy and walking in on pageant contestants who cares
“ still got some sharpness ” this is the exact issue the dnc is running a candidate where the argument is no longer that “ he is sharp ” no the argument is now as you said he has “ still got some sharpness ” i will vote for joe because i simply have no other choice that said he is no longer sharp they ’ve been hiding a clear cognitive decline for years and there is no reason to expect him to maintain even this level of cognitive function over the next 4 5 years that is n’t just neglect or a disservice to anyone who can acknowledge just how bad for the country a second trump term to be no it ’s near treason by those who want to hold out and maintain their power as opposed to relinquishing it before we end up in this situation worse still we ’ve been here just a few years ago with the dnc i love rbg truly her reputation however will be tarnished over the next decade because she chose to hold that seat deep into obama ’s 2nd term yet here we are repeating the near identical mistake a decade later it ’s pathetic and the dnc deserves to be torn down and rebuilt
33 % of voters know absolutely nothing they vote on optics biden will lose he should be replaced
i wish i shared that sentiment
i do n’t know i ’m a supporter and will vote for him regardless but it has me concerned i really appreciate what he has done the past four years and think he has made great strides in improving the country but after last night i just do n’t know if he has four more years in him i just do n’t know not feeling too hopeful today
way way better i think the only people who could flub that layup would be hillary old biden and maybe kamela even amy fucking klobuchar would dust trump just put any normal human against him newsom whitmer john stewart pritzger idc
i mean other democracies have done it it would be stressful for them yes but it ’s not impossible
it ’s not like biden ’s attracting those crucial groups himself at the moment
he had a major senior moment
is nt it more he was reading off a teleprompter in ral and obv did nt have one in the debate
biden had a teleprompter in nc with a pre written speech that 's the difference
he shoulda been on better cold meds last night
they are ignoring that it was late because his state of the union started at the same time and he was universally praised for how he looked and sounded during it the difference is the teleprompter perhaps he also had a cold but you ca n't blame that performance on it
we get it bud you 're not going to vote for the guy out of protest and then complain about the establishment while his opponent enacts a political agenda that is radically opposed to your own
vote for trump then enjoy your results
it was n't just a teleprompter he looked disinterested and lost several times trump has faults a mile long and biden did n't even look like he felt like bringing up the easy rebuttals
i ’m not saying winners use drugs but lance armstrong was a machine
trump is a convicted felon and traitor nothing that happened yesterday approaches those embarrassments
what about the global embarrassment named donald trump
he had one bad night trump meanwhile is never not a complete embarrassment to humanity
one debate performance is a drop in the bucket when compared to the embarrassments trump has put the country under people have such short attention spans to not remember his presidency
as will i we 're not the votes that matter right now though our minds were already made up we need someone inspiring that will get people to go out to vote who might otherwise not vote at all
i guess niave was n't strong enough a word delusional
yeah for sure rapidly declining old people tend to get better with time
shame dementia is progressive then
unless biden is going to start aging in reverse 4 additional months does n't play in his favor this debate was n't just bad it would n't have placed in a hs debate competition i will never vote for trump but the democratic party has been deluding itself to think that trump 's badness will get enough people to overlook biden 's feebleness
lol you ca n’t seriously be suggesting that reading a rehearsed teleprompter speech to 5 k people is the same as a 90 minute combative debate in front of millions
what are you talking about
i ’ve been breathing all day still it was a debacle why 1 his age has been a major topic of conversation for months 2 he had one job to assure people he was up to 4 more years he failed 3 the negative focus will now be on biden ’s “ fitness ” instead of trump ’s that is the opposite of what is needs to be 4 they ca n’t tell us “ democracy is at stake ” and then tell us he can do the job i certainly do n’t want to risk it 5 this was n’t a “ bad night ” or a cold if it was then a cold can knock out an 81 year old at a critical time and he should n’t be president 6 trump once said “ only i can do this ” that seems to be what biden is now saying biden did a great thing when he took the white house from trump he has done great things in his career the most patriotic thing he can now do is pass the torch
i do n't care about replacement choice as long as it 's not hillary or kamela whitmer john stewart bernie pritzker idc do n't matter to me just anyone who would actually win
idk how you can say that about him and not biden lol the other thing they agree upon is biden is toast
yeah man the emperor 's clothes are incredible are n't they the man is cognitively gone we 're getting our marching orders now p s donald is worse before people start sending me hate spam because i have described reality
that ’s exactly what trump supporters say about media pointing out his incompetence too
honestly i think they just do n’t care it ’s not even malicious at this point it ’s just
you 're not wrong but he is a hero he will step down eventually everyone has the big step down but what he was saying was true he really did have massive legislative wins in the face of a horrific house being in politics your whole life is n't always shameful we need leaders with experience and he 's a decent guy a decent guy who was publicly humiliated and got back up who ca n't relate to that we 're facing the choices we 're facing trump is pure evil down to the toe joe did n't blame anyone coming out of that debate trump would have thrown his allies right under the bus to maintain his fake aura of perfection joe does n't do that hillary did n't beat trump in her prime bernie is n't running joe has character and grit
i ’m just saying everyone treats trump with exceptions and then people justify it as “ well they just have to be careful etc etc ” but it just feels so insulting since if any average person did the things trump does in a court setting they would get the book thrown at them the law has to matter so if merchan goes soft on the sentencing despite having a defendant who is unrepentant and has numerous violations in his own court the reason better be fucking good asked from well it ’s trump and here is an exception
trump is jello made of fat he will slip by this time like he always does
tbh it 's similar to the judge in the darrel brooks case a few years ago the justice system is not remotely equipped to handle defendants who are bad actors on purpose and the only thing the judge can do to stop them is give them continuous warnings
i find it kind of hilarious that people basically tried to howard dean an incumbent president
yeah it 's amazing what a teleprompter and being out and about before the sundowning takes effect does to a guy
america loves an underdog not going 4d chess conspiracy but damned if that performance did n't make biden the world 's first underdog incumbent
he 's not making it 4 years if he were a decent man and not an egomaniac he would resign the presidency today
what come on at no point did he look confused about where he was and he knew what he was saying what he did look like was tired possibly sick and floored by his opponent ’s insane lies and how nobody called the lying out it ’s hard for a reasonable person to respond to absolute crazytown people who do n’t know what actual cognitive decline looks like should not be declaring biden has it get back to me when you ’ve done some clinical assessments of elderly people or actually had to orient them to time and place
dude looked like he had a cold and was trying to counter a rampaging gish gallop with his lifelong stutter while on a time crunch spoiler trying to talk fast makes a stutter worse i know that firsthand all things considered he did vert well but idiots will look at the guys who did nothing but lie but did it loudly and assume that that means competence
ad fodder like editing ca n’t produce negative ads out of thin air lol political ads do n’t need fodder either you vote for democracy or you vote for the felon who will set us back decades
maybe we can get the ny times editorial board ’s darlings amy klobuchar or elizabeth warren to replace him because after all they really knew what the american people wanted when they threw their endorsements behind those two yea biden ’s not ideal and we have people saying step aside ok for who and vague bullshit answers like “ anyone younger ” do n’t count i do n’t give a shit whose on the dem ticket when the choice is dem or christofascism heralded by the worst people our society has to offer like steve bannon roger stone and the rest of the circus freak show
really who then and who is going to choose him or her instead of actual democrat voters and what a secure position that would be to run against donald trump as the candidate hand picked by democratic elites all these progressives losing their shit the nyt editorial board of imbeciles first and foremost among them have n't learned a thing from 2016 cue a deluge of russian propaganda being spread by biden 's base there is no better perfect candidate you whiny ingrates you are already running the best president america has seen for at least half a century f ing stand by him you are his base
i do n’t agree i think the judge cut him slack despite being berated by trump so he could throw the book at him during sentencing do n’t forget 1 year is 1 20th of what he could get even 6 months would do it and house arrest is considered a jail term for the ballot clauses too
magatok is the next foxnews
he lost nothing 81 % of registered voters have nt changed their mind on any candidate that s a significant number this debate proved nothing for either party the media just wants to blow it up for the heck of it
you are right why does he not just surrender and hand the presidency to trump
you mean his ability to read a teleprompter
we got to take our reality and values back from these fake luxury marketers that got us all screwed up and worrying about looks all the time substance over bullcrap we 're all sick of the fake world but well we have to stand against it there is more than enough money in this country for all of us to live comfortably and it 's time to put an end to the gold rush fantasy in my mind it 's a national security issue for all of us to have a home reasonable work week time with friends and families and give each child the top education that money can buy
did you see his speech today it was great fiery and well spoken
absolutely agree he needs to be all over the place going after trump and being funny and self deprecating we saw it in this raleigh speech he is at his best when he is impassioned raising his voice being social with people if we had this biden last night the trump campaign would be terrified but oh well there is still time to win
biden did n't lose simply because trump did n't win it really was n't a real win for either or them or anybody else trump gets the same soundbites he 'd get anywhere and his spin machine will say whatever it was going to say anyway biden could have looked and sounded better but he at least had understanding of the context of the questions and tried to give answers with at least a nod to that context i find this debate reminiscent of the nixon kennedy debate people who watched that debate said that kennedy won largely because he looked and sounded confident whereas people who listened to the debate transitional period of radio to tv felt that nixon won this biden trump debate is similar trump looked better on tv from a purely visual perspective but biden sounded better if you listened to what either of them actually said
i disagree people are overreacting about two lost trains of thought and a dozen stumbling of words he had some good lines and some great points his four years of success in the role in question matter a lot more than one fumbled debate
i do n't know who you 'd replace him with it 's not kamala
too many people most i 'm assuming is bad faith this sub has been a shitshow are harping on the guy who needed a cough drop and not the guy who incoherently rambled non stop lies because his brain is pudding
a deal killer for maga supporters lol
nope it 's too late you do n't sub in a new candidate in july for an election in november i think it 's naive to think that can work in politics nbsp the reality is that trump is a terrible candidate this race would be over if nikki haley was the republican nominee but it 's not trump has his cult base but he is also hated more than anyone else in america and he is a convicted felon and he is old and he has a bad message you are making the mistake of thinking this race will be about this debate unless the biden campaign completely fails it will not matter in november
there 's an added issue now that people have seen this live any videos like this ca n't just be called a i generated believably get ready to see a lot of fakes
haha trump ’s optics are shit there are plenty of people in the middle who can be swayed with arguments
it ’s not obama also had a first debate showing against romney true obama did n’t carry the baggage that biden does but romney also did n’t have the major turn offs that trump does i think if dems can drive the narrative of the damage project 2025 will do to our country and the impact bidens administration has had then i can see the next four months going for biden there ’s also more criminal trials for trump to get to as well
but after last night i just do n’t know if he has four more years in him as morbid as it sounds he does n't need to be there all four years
kennedy was ahead in most polls prior to the first debate want to try again
ah yes hillary would have been terrible she only completely wiped the floor with trump on every debate you definitely seem to be commenting in good faith s
yeah but to be blunt it requires more than one shit debate performance it should be reserved for things like finding out that a candidate has raped someone or has been convicted or is involved in a massive scandal involving a treasonous attempt to interrupt the nation ’s certification of the election you know little things like that
i feel the same as the guy above but i absolutely am still going to vote for biden if he 's running against trump i 'd vote for a potato over trump the issue is i 'm starting to feel like that 's actually what i 'm voting for it 's not people like me whose vote matter though i 'm going to vote democrat no matter what the issue is you need someone inspiring to get people to come out who vote who might not vote otherwise i 'm just worried because biden 2024 is making hillary 2016 look like an excellent candidate
we get it bud you ’re going to pretend biden ’s decline is n’t a serious issue and continue gaslighting anyone who brings it up as a problem and then complain when his opponent wins in a landslide
they probably pumped him full of stimulants and gave him a teleprompter it ’s obvious why there ’s a difference in performance but you ’re choosing to be wilfully ignorant
just because the gop has no standards does n't mean the dems should have none and send this lifeless corpse to be a presidential candidate kamala is very disliked and biden is mentally gone that does n't inspire voting turnout of undecided voters
“ let me just say after watching tonight ’s debate both of these men should be using performance enhancing drugs as much of it as they can get as many times a day as their bodies will allow performance enhancing drugs that will improve their lucidity their ability to solve problems and in one of the candidates ’ case improve their truthfulness morality and malignant narcissism whatever magical drugs that can kick their brains into gear because this ai n’t olympic swimming oh he solved the middle east but he was doping so it does n’t count ’ and if those drugs do n’t exist if there are n’t actual performance enhancing drugs for these candidates i could sure fucking use some recreational ones right now because this can not be real life it just ca n’t fuck we ’re america ”
which is why this is such a terrible situation no matter your opinion of him the chances of trump winning raised exponentially last night and trying to cope with “ biden made more money ” does not help being complacent and acting like all is well is what happened in 2016
every young person i know is saying “ i was gon na vote for biden but i do n’t know anymore i might just not vote ” or something along these lines in a race this close this is game over for biden
delusional would be thinking one poor debate performance is going to eclipse trumps criminal felony sentencing in two weeks
remember biden ’s state of the union address
yawn lazy and tired narrative pretend the sky is falling in 4 months
one he does n’t have dementia two 4 months with dementia would n’t be world changing difference three tired and lazy narrative
you ca n't say that trump is a threat to democracy and then have biden looking like that he 's supposed to be president at 86 when he looked barely alive mouth agape staring into space at the debate we all know trump is a threat so democrats need to act like they believe it the election is coming down to a handful of idiots in a few swing states anyone who is a swing voter at this point is a moron and all they 're going to see is biden barely able to speak
this post is literally about biden ’s raleigh speech where he is n’t reflecting those things you ’re pushing so hard months ago he gave an electric state of the union speech he is n’t melting in 4 months as much as you want to pretend
bro he just needed some of this energy last night wtf
did they drug him into the ground last night where the fuck was this energy
biden is not dropping out you can either support him or suppress the vote with your doom and gloom helping trump maybe think of the most patriotic thing you can do right now
agreed man what a shit show this is all the dnc ’s making
i genuinely think replacing biden at this point can be seen as a weakness right wingers were creating that narrative two years ago they also would love for a new candidate to come in 4 months from the election this is feeling like a damned if you do damned if you do nt kind of moment
if you looked at the policies biden implemented he has been the most progressive president america has ever seen even bernie sanders says so he subsidized life saving medicine for the elderly cracked down on junk fees and his fcc has been more aggressive in breaking up monopolies than prior democrat or republican presidents
i agree that merchan should not treat trump with kid gloves at sentencing but my point was that merchan bent over backwards during the trial to avoid validating any grounds for appeal
we have a legal right to defend ourselves but we do n't have an equal defense our law does n't account for the fact that people can pay for a better defense attorney if trump had a court appointed lawyer then he would have had the book thrown at him because the court appointed lawyer would n't have time to find a new defense for him everytime he steps out of line however since he has a limitless lawyer fund he has a wide range of options of how he can weasel out of his charges
but that 's not true judges hold people in contempt all the time and actually hold them in detention merchan was permitted to detain trump based on his contempt the justice system just does n't give a shit about poor people and gives undue deference to rich and famous people
are you kidding with this comparison howard dean yelled with enthusiasm once biden displayed cognitive disintegration on live tv there is no comparison between those two things look am i voting for biden yes because the alternative is trump and nuff said there but to act like biden 's catastrophe last night was just a nothingburger to shake off is unreal the dude did not look mentally fit to be president
howard dean does n't work in 2024
did you see that debate the president said he killed medicare bumbled fumbled and completely lost his train of thought consistently was unable to call out a single lie that was the craziest shit i 've ever seen watching debates back to clinton bush he is a seriously ill old man and thinking he should continue is elder abuse
i do n't think it 's sundowning a couple hours after the debate he was getting a crowd fired up at a party then meeting voters at a waffle house and chatting with them quite coherently if he was sundowning he 'd have gotten even worse my guess is that he took too much nyquil before the debate
it 's not so much the energy it 's the fact that he got up and faced the blowback he took the heat he kept going he stayed the course so what if he needs to get to bed early hell i need to get to bed early i 'll take sleepy grandpa who believes in this country 8 days a week over felon sexual assaulter braggart with pancake makeup who lies about jesus trump is like a state college frat guy dressed up like tammy faye baker
can we stop with the sundowning bullshit my mother who had early onest alzheimer 's disease actually went through a sundowning period it does not look like what we saw on the debate stage last night i was n't happy with the performance i thought it was one of the most abysmal performances i 've seen but being old and flubbing your words does n't mean sundowning
if the plan was to go out and look like that then whoever came up with it needs to be slapped and hard
i disagree he is a decent man he told the truth nothing i have seen in the last 4 years says he 's an ego maniac you think any of these other dems want to take on the maniac who can say anything in debate and have no consequences hillary lost to him biden is great man the best person for the job with a great team behind him and he will win this is the best time for real americans to come together and kill the maga movement and these nasty christian nationalists
this is cope he had an empty open mouthed far off stare basically the entire time he was n’t speaking i ’ve seen that look in multiple loved ones i ’ve lost once they got to the stage where we could n’t let them have the keys to their car anymore it was heartbreaking then and is for biden as well telling people to deny their eyes might work fine for the democratic base but wo n’t play well with the independent voters biden needs to get to 270
people were earlier saying shapiro and i think he could pull it off he gets biden voters right away and pa right away he is young inoffensive capable and a good speaker he just needs to give a mediocre showing and he would win throw pete b on the ticket and i might actually start feeling good about my country again
he 's gon na get a fine which he 'll easily pay and the judge will ask him to please do better next time the justice system is specifically designed to make sure rich and powerful people are let off as easy as possible there 's no universe where he faces real consequences here because that would require a completely different justice system
what the nytimes editorial board suggested today he step down immediately this is one of the oldest largest dem supporting papers in the country that speaks volumes to how bad last night was for president biden edit not step down immediately from office but his reelection campaign
where did you get that misinformation tiktok how the hell does anyone know what 81 % of 100 million people think
why do that when we can have a democratic nominee who is n’t 1000 and can speak in full sentences
yeah i saw it i do n’t think it ’s coincidental that he sounds better in the middle of the day than he does at 9 pm with or without a cold but especially with a cold he is also much better when doing a speech and he is also quite good one on one in interviews and with crowd work the reality is that he is 80 and old people are not known for being night owls
he read off a teleptomoter in friendly environment yay i love joe and will vote blue no matter who i 'm worried about those not as determined and biden ca n't win be a small margin or it 's trials that are absurd but will go up to scotus and a 5 4 decision will come out that will shame bush v gore while they 're at it they could even rule on the immunity case we 're fucked if we whistle past the graveyard on this and it appears that we are so again i say yay
bc he s reading off a teleprompter
it was read off a teleprompter and it still lacked charisma there is time to replace him almost anyone could else beat trump
except for the moments where biden lost his train of thought i wish biden had been better about turning trump 's bs against him but that is n't really something a debate prep team can predict to practice trump hit biden over the head repeatedly with the afghanistan debacle and his only response was ' we got our people out ' how about ' we only had to leave because you set the retreat date ' or ' remember when donald tried to bring the troops back in december 2020 ' several times trump had the sheer audacity to make claims about how great something was at the end of his presidency the economy was great nobody was crossing the border where was ' the end of your presidency was a global pandemic ' ' the economy was crashing and all you did was hand corporations billions of dollars to buy back their own stock ' or drop the real bomb ' you threw out america 's pandemic response toolkit and the consequence of that was over a million dead americans and a billion dead around the world ' blame him for the shit he demonstrably failed at that fucked us all over
you may disagree but what about your average voter who is n’t committed to voting biden that ’s who matters
his four years of success in the role matter more you can believe that but that 's not reflected in how this election cycle is going right now that 's not what the electorate sees
while i think his four years of success in office ought to matter more than his fumbled debate i do n't think that will be the case there is a difference between what view i wish people had about this and the cold hard reality of how damaging last night was to biden 's candidacy he did not look like someone who is strong enough to continue effectively for another four years
how do you reconcile last night 's performance with 1 what he 's going to be like in 3 years and 2 skills that are required for a president to perform their job well i was team biden look at my post history but last night was a game changer he 's not qualified
both of them looked like their brains are pudding is trump a worse person yes will i be voting for biden yes but do act like biden 's problem was needing a cough drop rather than acknowledging that he was totally incoherent at times and just stared blankly off into space like a fucking corpse really misses the point he barely seemed to be alive
it 's not just that he needed a cough drop it was an absolute disaster he looked and sounded frail he did not speak coherently when he had opportunities to pounce on trump 's weaknesses such as abortion he was ineffective if he had a bit of a hoarse voice due to a cold but otherwise had a good debate we would n't be having this conversation trump has obviously done many things that ought to be disqualifying but that 's precisely why people are harping on biden because when the stakes are so high we need someone with a good chance of winning and whether you think it 's fair or not last night 's performance seriously harmed biden 's chance of winning
i 'm a democrat because i believe government needs to be based in honesty and objectivity objectively biden demonstrated last night he lacks the communication skills to continue to act as chief executive we ca n't have a president that 's incoherent when he has a cold it 's disqualifying biden needs to selflessly step down here and hand the reigns to a successor the stakes are too important
i hope so but this is apples to oranges i think obama was flat not unintelligible obama also did n’t have to wait 2 5 months for a second chance which if i ’m trump there is no way i debate a second time he had joe wipe the floor with paul ryan in the vp debate then crushed the following two this bad debate did n’t have a lot of time to ruminate like it will with joe
obama ’s tough night vs biden ’s clear cognitive decline is not a great comparison
a lot of undeclared people do n't like harris so that does n't really help best case is biden lost 3 points which is enough to swing the election i think it 'll be more
this is such a terrible attitude and not even because it ’s morbid you cannot run someone acknowledging they ’re declining cognitively and physically right up to deaths door yet that ’s what the dnc has chosen joe needs votes he needs to pull independents and dig into the haley republicans that hate trump for independents that means people who avoid politics at all costs biggest news story in the world is that biden is declining cognitively and could barely get through a 90 minute debate they are n’t seeing the speech in raleigh after they ’ll see bits of that debate though these voters do n’t know whether trump is honest or not they do know whether biden is falling apart
prior polls to an election are always up and down it not debatable that that debate did n’t matter to the end result
yeah wtf guys are you gon na stoop to the maga level and back biden no matter what
no one cares if he is sleepy since the other candidate is a felon and traitor to the country you need better material
the guilty verdict had no impact he is still ahead in polls nationally and comfortablely ahead in key swing states how is sentencing going to make a difference after 8 years of trump and every motherf ing thing he has has said and done he is totally finally going down this time guys delusional was the right word indeed
a criminal conviction is a problem but it just does n't impact fitness for the job trump is n't fit for the job but that has nothing to do with a conviction biden is n't fit for the job and that 's not going to change because the other guy has to pay a fine
absolutely if that joe appeared last night would 've been great also consider both sotu and today 's rally are both prepared speeches the issue his ability to think on his feet and respond to be clear joe biden took an abortion answer that was ready to be his strongest position and answer of the night and converted it to an immigration response which is his worst biden fucked up the debate no one else and to be clear i was trying to defend biden until after the debate started but to continue after seeing what i saw is delusional
of course he does n't because it does n't fit his narrative
adderall 100 % he was jacked up at the sotu
problem is you ca n't be a president when you are feeling good he needs to show the electorate that he is capable 100 % of the time 8 years ago we had the phone call in the middle of the night discussion and biden made a lot of people question him last night it 's playing right into trump 's hand unfortunately
the dean scream doomed a much more able bodied and mentally acute howard dean 20 years ago an event as atrocious as last night 's debate is not overcome but a speech the next day it 's a drop of poison in the soup whatever gets added to it afterwards does n't matter i want to reiterate i 'm not saying this as a trump supporter i 'm saying this as someone that desperately wants a competent candidate to defeat trump
you ca n't let biden go to other world leaders with a teleprompter though
the president can step down and his vice president will become the president and we will have to vote for her
i 'm sure your finger wagging will do wonders for the turnout you 're so concerned about
for who who is going to vote for biden but not vote for someone else i think there 's basically no undecideds these 2 dudes have been around for 10 years now everyone 's mind is made up the only question is whether people show up to vote and biden is spite motivating republicans to show up this time just like trump did for dems last time it 's just this time nobody is excited about biden i think biden is far superior to trump even if he 's dead but i 'm obsessed with politics most people see too terrible options and might not show up to vote because why bother which is why you need a more unknown slightly less shit option newsom mayor pete whitmer does n't matter you just need a warm body to not look they are having a stroke
i think judges are too pussified to deal with him i mean when his fans are ignorant thugs threatening to kill your wife kids and other family members like they did dr fauci and others it 's rather intimidating
cognitive disintegration because he stumbled over words dude i ’ve been around elderly people much of my life and have seen all kinds of mental decline that was n’t it that was an over prepped old guy with a stutter and a cold trying to react live to a crazy guy spewing outrageous lies while “ moderators ” seemed to accept the insanity is biden a step slower you bet did he look low energy for sure but he did n’t show signs of dementia at all
i feel like i 'm taking crazy pills with how nonchalant people are being about biden 's obvious mental decline i 'm with you i 'll obviously vote for him if it comes down to it but he 's currently losing the swing states he 'll lose to trump if he 's the candidate we do n't have to go with biden we still have time to pick a different candidate he 's being selfish and his staff are being selfish they 've known for months that he 's been in decline it 's why he 's did n't do the super bowl interview they want him to stay in so that they can keep their jobs but what they do n't seem to understand is that if when he loses they 'll still be out of jobs people who do n't follow politics day to day saw a corpse on that stage who could barely talk compare that to who trump seemed more lively and vibrant nevermind that he was spewing bullshit the majority are n't critical thinkers
cope is unreal here this was a disaster we could n't afford pretending it 's not will accomplish nothing
he 's being selfish and so is his staff he said he 'd only run for one term and make way for someone younger well looks like he 's going to try and pull a jedd bartlett but he does n't have aaron sorkin writing this story step aside joe do n't let your legacy become losing to the literal worst felon president if when he loses and trump gets back in the white house he may not leave he may get 2 more justices we 'll be dealing with the consequences for literal decades
i say sundowning somewhat sarcastically but it 's clear that he 's not all there neither is trump but it was less noticeable with him
do n't get me wrong i 'm voting for biden but the narrative that is being attempted to be spun about how joe is up off the mat and the debate was a blip is ridiculous turnout is gon na decide this election and biden gave a lot of apathetic voters a reason to stay home in november
buttigieg ca n’t win and will tank the dem ticket if he ’s on it the us will not elect a gay person to be president or vp he also is a lightweight with little experience compared with other prominent democrats who would be great candidates
maybe the only thing that makes me think there will be some kind of physical sentence is the repeated breaches of the gag order and that the judge will ask trump if he wants to make a statement if trump was smart he would show remorse but i have a feeling he ’ll either decline to speak on advice if his lawyer or go on a tirade i do n’t think a fine for 34 felony counts is realistic i sadly think he ’ll get house arrest but that still ticks the boxes for those two states not having them on the ballot
people on this site are delusional at this point they genuinely believe that biden could still win an election if he alienated every possible voting demographic who needs young people moderates progressives independents and undecided voters after all he ’s only been 1 point behind for months now and barely won the first time losing chunks of his voter base and failing in his largest public appearance in a year is good for biden apparently
have you read the nyt lately i do n't think so
100 % nothing changed magats will vote for trump anyone previously voting for biden either wants biden or they just do n't want trump undecideds that actually want to vote wo n't be voting for trump based on that debate last night just got ta hope most vote for biden i mean yeah he did n't sound literally great but he actually answered the questions mostly and did n't just parrot utter nonsenseical lies
i saw that but replace him with who at this late date it would be like suggesting that everyone go vote for the independent which will only divide the democratic vote and trump wins
i ’m not sure it ’s about whether he can win or not or just educated journalists being responsible about not endorsing an octogenarian for president
who cares what they suggested it does nt matter if registered voters do nt care it makes no sense to step down end of story
its called cnn i do nt read tiktok or follow nonsense on social media like a maga supporter
because we live in the real world where that sort of gambit in this moment in time basically assures defeat yeah sure let 's hobble the national party by essentially having the presumptive nominee concede to bring in an unknown reliever and that reliever has to close out the game with a strong headwind when was unfortunately probably about a year and a half ago if the dnc is worth its salt they would have a short list of 2028 possible leaders but who knows they did coast on the biden train to this destination but they ca n't run him again in ' 28 for a bunch of obvious reasons whatever happens this year they simply ca n't coast anymore their attrition rate is too high honestly ' 28 might be the big break for progressives as the younger wing is the literal future of the party due to entropy alone so if they bring out someone probably in their 40s with a national profile and push strong social practices along with nuts and bolts shit well i think they could win handily against whatever hideous abomination the 2028 gop is going to be
you honestly believe he had a cold i do n’t believe it for a second he ’s unfortunately has late stage dementia that is getting progressively worse imagine him in the next two years yikes
replacing makes no sense since kamala would be the replacement or it would splinter the voter base and she ’ll take over anyways if he seriously becomes too old or dies
i completely disagree that one debate four months before the election will have more of an impact than four years in the role as president the hot takes here are insane
what vague bs is “ he does n’t look strong enough to do his job for four years ” let ’s not diagnose him through the tv his four year record in the role matters more than anything and if he ’s too weak or dies is really a catastrophe presidents have died in office pretty often the vp steps up and the country moves on what we absolutely do n’t need is another four years of the nightmare that is trump
i ’d rather look at four years of success than one bad debate followed by a bunch of armchair doctors diagnosing him watch his speech from today he was fiery and well spoken
you were never team biden lol if a few stumbling words overweighs all the good biden has done for the country then you were never ever team biden trump is a 34 time convict who lies like no other to put himself in a better position its not rational at all to have a guy like that in office when you have another who hasent committed any evil or harm to this country its honestly a no brainer but then again i do nt think you were ever team biden if you are changing your vote over a speech impediment
well will see but everyone knows the horror trump has caused to this country and if anything the debate exposed him more for constant lying and negativity there is nothing positive about the guy except that he may sound more confident during a debate which in the end indicates nothing this will be a close election but biden will win
trump will absolutely want to debate again closer to the election he ’s got criminal trials coming up and will want an “ easy victory ” closer to election day the real tell will be if biden repeats his performance or not
he gave a great speech today the point is one bad debate performance with 4 months to go is n’t the nail on the coffin everyone says it is especially when trump has his criminal felony sentencing in two weeks they way sensationalism works is that everyone jumps to one extreme or the other without taking a step back to look at the bigger picture
i loathe the word cope but we 're about to march right into fascism because the dnc supporters refuse to even acknowledge that they 're fucking up let alone proposing solutions to problems that to everyone else are blindingly obvious the hubris i 'm seeing is fucking insane
is that all it is the other guy has to pay a fine you make it sound like trump got a parking ticket or something it ’s so weird where we are now that just confidently spouting bullshit is looked at more favorably than not speaking clearly it seems like we value appearance more than substance
biden is literally already doing the job
point being that speech was a few months and it ’s already in the rear view and in a few months from now biden will have dozens of new opportunities to bring new light thanks you for acknowledging how fast the past can become the past
nah you ’re just a conspiracy theorist
the “ dean scream ” had zero bearing when howard dean was a lost cause to begin with he was doomed to lose after finishing third in the iowa caucus before it even occurred but carry on talking about things you were n’t aware of
and i ’m sure you would n’t resort to this impotent jab if you were n’t afraid your boy trump will lose again
me too i honestly do n't know if we can trust the dnc 's take on things
biden sounded like my grandfather slow to talk trips over words sometimes sounded raspy my grandfather is % 100 coherent he ’s bright as hell he just has a hard time talking sometimes especially when he ’s sick and biden sounded sick as hell
let 's not kid ourselves he showed signs 100 % of dementia and there 's no denying it so you want this guy with his finger on the button you think he 's going to be able to remember the nuclear codes policy decisions immigration decisions i 'm not saying trump 's any better in fact he 's probably worse both need to be replaced
biden is tired after work and suddenly every wannabe pundit busts out their thesaurus looking for attention it 's crazy to see
yeah trump was noticeably less animated than he was in 2016 or even 2020 like trump made one or two angry nonsensical rambles black jobs anyone but he 's definitely slowed down compared to the guy making goofy faces during his debates with clinton
i understand what you 're saying but it 's only one day after there 's a lot to do between now and november and he is back up off the mat the real apathetic voters were n't voting anyways the in the middle ones if they feel any kind of way after yesterday will change 100 times between now and november the narrative about joe off the mat is n't wrong he said it i do n't debate walk talk like i used to but i know how to do this job someone that can look at defeat take an l but keep going has grit that 's real at least to me when he gave the speech in nc they were chanting 4 more years i realized he 's a man he 's an old human but he knows how to do the job i know people half his age that if they were humiliated on tv they 'd give up naw i 'm encouraged and i 'm spreading the vibes because he 's our guy do i support the man or not is it going to be substance over form or not i ca n't let apathy and cynicism take my eyes off the ball and for this guy going after the bully
biden gave a lot of apathetic voters a reason to stay home in november dawg if they were apathetic you really think they 're tuning into a presidential debate in june never ever underestimate how checked out the average voter is and how recent events just wash right over them i freaked out i 'm still freaked out but i 'm also willing to wait and see
buttigieg ca n’t win and will tank the dem ticket if he ’s on it this is why i spent some time with but eventually tapped out of dump biden talk people start bringing up names as if they 're viable and they 're straight delusional i really like petey b but pretending like the gay issue which should n't be there is n't there is pure magical thinking
yeah there 's an insane level of copium huffing going on in this sub right now the majority of people seem to be recognizing just how much of a disaster the debate was but there 's still like 20 % of people here desperately trying to spin it as all good
yes and they are very left still which i do n’t mind as it just one source of news for me and no newsmax and fox are not in my rotation
lol it was so sad to see jill pander to him after the debate oh congrats you answered all the questions it was like she was talking to a toddler believe me many dems are not happy with the state of our country and i ’m one of them
you need to win swing states which includes the rustbelt most states are locked do you really think whitmer or shapiro who have already proved they can win ca n't win their own states and region that 's a bold claim and considering bidens performance it would at least increase our chances at this point just a candidate forming a coherent thought in a debate improves the odds
i ’m thinking a they know joe is declining rapidly and no way he will be fit in 5 yrs and they do not want to see kamala as president b they foresee a loss based upon the cover story that president biden is at the top of his game stated just in the last 30 days by those close to him wink wink and all the left media c they know jill will be charged with abusing the elderly if she makes him run but on a serious note it was a sad day to see the president of the united states perform so poorly and it will have a major impact until he can prove without a teleprompter that he can hold a conversation or an actual tough interview not like the last couple of softball interviews he has had
one of the biggest themes of this election cycle is that most voters do n't see biden 's 4 years as a success despite the improving economy etc there 's been like a million op eds and it 's been the top priority of the dnc to try to figure out how to get that messaging across also the average swing voter absolutely is taking the soundbites and general sentiment coming off this debate seriously it 's a massively trending topic across social media and is going to leave a lasting impression on people as a primetime tv event and not some dry news about the unemployment numbers dropping by 2 %
ok but his approval ratings are terrible and have been for years no this debate wo n't have more impact than his four years as president but people already were n't happy with his four years as president so if we 're voting on that it 's also likely a losing bet and i think he 's been a good president i do n't understand the hate for him but i can acknowledge the hate is there so if he ca n't run on his record and he 's a terrible debater well that 's pretty bad
i 'd vote for a literal corpse before i voted for donald trump obviously harris would be better than trump if biden is incapacitated but that 's not the point public perceptions of his health and strength matter you do n't have to think it 's fair and acknowledging this does n't negate the bajillion things trump has done that are disqualifying the issue is that this debate very negatively affected the public 's perception of biden in a way that affects his likelihood of winning the last thing we need as you said is four more years of trump which is precisely why it 's so important for biden to step aside to reduce the likelihood of that outcome
4 year record of high grocery prices and a lot of people are hurting this was his chance to set the record straight instead of letting the gop frame it as bidenflation he failed dramatically at all the points he needs to be strong on did n't spend enough time on issues he is strong on and he went after points he 's weak on such as immigration all the while he stared confusingly into space if someone were applying for a job in my team and they looked like that i would n't even consider them appearing strong and confident matters a lot to people consciously and subconsciously trump is bad very bad but it 's pure copium to think that he does n't have a real possibility of being reelected and that biden did fine last night having to justify something is a losing position damage control there are many voters who do n't hang out on reddit politics that are only going to look at the realities of their finances biden let trump grab the win there reframing the economic situation and pushing hard on rvw reproductive rights needed to happen and it did not
you had your blinders on and somehow you want everyone else to put one on no to each its own the fear going in was n’t about what he had done in the last four years it ’s about whether he still has the marbles for another four years he failed miserably and confirmed all of the caricatures of him out there he confirmed very viscerally that he is n’t any more fit than trump to occupy the office
agree that he and his team have done a great job these last 4 years but you got ta look forward it 's not gon na get better we ca n't have last night as the face of america to the rest of the world even if it only happens once in awhile
who says i 'm voting trump over biden you 're putting words in my mouth i am most definitely in favor of biden stepping back and endorsing a successor something that should n't be a controversial view after last night i 'm seeing a lot of gaslighting out here biden was awful you ca n't justify it and interestingly the people in my circle that are pushing the narrative that dems have to stick with biden are the trump lovers because they 're scared to death that any other democrat will beat trump
if everyone knew the horror that trump caused this would n't be a close election the fact is that 30 or so percent of the country loves the guy another 10 % tolerate him due to preferences on taxes and judges and some others are open to voting for him there are also disaffected folks who may dislike trump but perceive biden as weak and senile last night 's debate played right into that narrative such voters might not vote for biden but would be open to voting for another democrat i truly think that last night 's debate seriously wounded biden 's image with the voting public in a way that he is unlikely to be able to recover from
whoever he endorses whitmer newsome buttigieg other than kamala i think all are electable and would do a fine job especially when the other option is trump
i loathe the word cope but we 're about to march right into fascism because the dnc supporters refuse to even acknowledge that they 're fucking up if people defending biden is copium then people suggesting biden step aside for some unknown candidate is definitely hopium
that was n't my point my point was those 2 were prepared speeches he read anyone can read last night was a debate where he had to demonstrate his executive function here 's the difference if biden has to get on a call with another leader let 's say bibi and let 's say biden would like to convince bibi to allow aid trucks into an inaccessible war zone will bibi listen to a prepared speech or may he have a couple of rebuttals he expects to be responded to in real time or more complex let 's say biden wants to try to convince putin to slow or halt his invasion of a neighboring country do you think putin will listen to a prepared speech or maybe putin object and interject with some of his own intentions and rationalization that biden would have to rebutt in real time in each case i suspect the later is more important and i know that i no longer trust biden to be capable of those conversations i do n't trust trump either but it 's for different reasons not everything is zero sum some things should be the best for the job and neither of these guys are the best for the job
me neither i just do n’t know anymore i was n’t concerned until last night i feel moderately better with the speech he gave today but that was from a teleprompter i just do n’t know
people being apathetic or even checked out does n't mean they are n't at least loosely paying attention the media will be showing and discussing biden 's age for at least the next week and after that the gop will be more than happy to remind people of this biden this is n't going away biden 's age was an issue four years ago it was an issue 48 hours ago before the debate it will continue to be an issue until election day
pete b is a great communicator and definitely sharp but getting blue collar randy in middle michigan or pennsylvania to vote for a gay guy married to another man is a tall order
they constantly platform people who lie about trans people they are conservatives
aye but you 'll vote biden anyway because fuck trump hopefully they 'll setup a decent candidate for the next one and bidens done a good job just because he fumbled hard in a debate does n't mean he 's all of a sudden incapable of continuing to do a good job
neither of those candidates raised any money nearing the amount biden raised that can be used in an election biden is the only person who has ever polled well versus trump this was the least watched debate that indicates to me that everyone has their minds made up at this point we only need to sway the undecided and everything indicated that they have not been paying attention to anything edit adding links “ while she may have privately turned a few happy cartwheels yes really over her 2022 victory she is n’t widely celebrated as a top party performer too often she ’s mentioned only perfunctorily in conversations about 2024 or worse left out entirely ” also she declared she does n’t want it i m not seeing anything that suggests shapiro would do well with middle america
i hear you on this but i think if biden just keeps campaigning and maintains his passion and energy will be fine i d say trump would have a better chance if he just admitted he was a liar and he plans to change but nope
four good years matters way more than a tv perception of one night
he was on fire today with his speech i think this was just one bad night it will blow over in the four months until the election
this is a flawed argument you always choose the best president based on their previous success and policies just say you like trump there is nt a single good thing trump has done for america
i like that commenters are showing what they ’re really about like you said last night was unjustifiable it was literally the worst case scenario the things he said were good the way he said them and the way he handled himself was shocking trump is a not an option and i ’ll 100 % vote for biden come election day but the die hard party democrat is so similar to the maga crowd
ehhh buttigieg is about as feasible as kamala jb pritzker might be a better option i think whitmer is perhaps their best most practical bet
unknown newsom would have swept the floor with trump last night
yeah if you asked me last week i ’d say that biden had a relatively easy win coming his way in november i ’m terrified now after what i saw last night i m glad that this speak today was good but i ca n’t just ignore what happened just last night
wow the gray lady is conservative bs they are left all day long they may not be a progressive as some would like but in no way would they be considered conservative centric left maybe
for the longest time they refused to even mention the many problems in trans issues just because they actually got the courage and journalistic integrity to talk about it is not a minus in my book things like the cass report should be talked about there is a reason some of the most left countries in the world are rolling back puberty blockers for kids and that 's because the science is not thorough and lacks a lot of evidence and there are many other issues as well like self id in safe spaces or the sports issue let 's not pretend this is n't a complicated issue that should be discussed sending someone to a women 's prison because a criminal self ids or taking away the hard work for athletes training their whole life merits discussion and nyt refused for the longest time because they were to the left just because they are finally opening the conversation is not a downside to most liberals
nah most people are going to vote for trump after this disastrous performance by biden i know i will
yeah no i am voting for orange man in three years the dem party failed our country we are not in a good place i m concerned about our economy taxes border deficit gov spending international relations and trade as well as the electric everything goals set forth by this admin i say dig baby dig
51 million people watched where are you getting that nobody watched literally the biggest broadcast besides sports like the super bowl will it affect polling hard to tell because biden voters are simply voting against trump so that does n't change that much but it may and will come out in the following weeks would not be surprised that people do a protest choice in polling as a message democrats have already made clear in polling they do n't like the choice it just depends how the question is asked
least watched debate no that is n’t true
the problem is that biden does n't come across as energetic and at this age people do n't get more energetic whether fair or not his performance fueled questions about whether he is capable of another four years in this role
this is precisely how we got where we are today
what you see with your own eyes is not perception it ’s called reality in less political climes
yeah it does n't jive with what i 'm hearing from irl friends feels like there 's some serious astroturfing going on right now
you 're probably right on buttigieg i 'm fine with pritzker too
newsom would have swept the floor with trump last night that 's not a given you can throw out whatever names you want but the fact is that any potential replacement is currently unknown that 's why the suggestion biden be replaced is hopium those people are simply hoping that the replacement they 're naming would be the one chosen and that they would be a significantly better candidate than biden in less than 4 months edit i have no doubt that newsom would have performed better than biden in the debate but this was a single debate it 's not the election
do n’t waste your time with atalan they only can see one point of view and just told me that i want to see trans people killed the kid is a fucking moron
yeah good idea what things did he say to convince you you were always going to vote for trump
okay okay so you 're participating in bad faith if you 're gon na astroturf you should hide it a little better
while still a sizable tv audience it represents sharp drop in viewership from the first biden trump debate in 2020 which drew 73 million viewers the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign cycle drew about 51 3 million people according to the media analytics company nielsen a sharp drop from previous debates and the smallest audience since a 2004 debate between john kerry and president george w bush
bold claim without a link
if only there were 4 months to work on that
armchair medical diagnosis is not reality four years of results is
stack the court put 100 liberal justices on it during the next democratic administration that will force america to actually considering reforming the court versus accepting its clearly bias rulings
ok for real when are we storming the supreme court and getting rid of these crazy people this is actually insane can anybody do anything
i second this they wanna break shit let ’s break shit
vote volunteer or hell run yourself
you can do something at any time
an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind do n't stoop to their level
do n't stoop to their level you 're right let 's go lower its the only way for this country to survive as a democracy
it 's not eye for an eye to dilute a clearly bribed and biased judiciary
we 're already not a democracy luckily i have dual citizenship and am looking to the eu america is past saving already mine as live with morals at least
i would pick a person who had a bad day debating over a habitual liar any day
everyone here focusing on the debate while meanwhile the battle has been a bloody fucking loss for democracy in the past couple of weeks do your fucking job and get the supreme court in line
that was n't a bad debate biden was n't lucid and could n't form a complete thought trump was a firehose of irrelevant and confidently spoken bullshit so he won and now the media is doing it 's usual playbook of actual democratic candidate is guaranteed loser hypothetical candidate would do much better against the opponent and when the democrats settle on any other candidate repeat 1 it 's consistent every election cycle no existing democratic candidate ever measures up republicans are n't ever held to that standard either i 'm voting for biden or whoever runs with d by their name but holy fucking shit please pick someone who is actually lucid
bad debate nights happen this was a disastrous debate night with the future of our republic in the balance
bad debate dude has one foot in the grave and another on a banana peel
gore ’s town hall debate in 2000 was bad obama ’s first debate on 2012 was bad trump ’s first debate in 2020 was bad this was n’t that this was an all time disaster
obama is correct trump had a terrible debate but biden was so bad that it set the bar for trump low enough that trump doing badly allowed him to still win that is unacceptable democrats need to stop meeting republicans shortcomings with equal short comings imagine if obama was on that staged against trump obama could have had a bad debate night and still make trump look like an ameba
speaking as someone from the uk looking in from the outside and desperately wanting trump to lose this is madness how anyone can suggest that biden should stay on after that is beyond me it ’s confirmed all of trumps attack lines and in an age where people do n’t trust the news they ’ll trust their own eyes he really looked like he should be in a care home democrats have to wake up and not try and convince themselves that everything is all right
does anyone here think biden will do better at the next one
this is n’t a bad debate this was not knowing what he was even saying at times
man for obama to even admit this was a bad debate night is itself not good news normally he just brushes things off i really hope this debate is a wake up call to democrats people have been pointing out issues with biden 's cognitive abilities for four years i always assumed he was only running for 1 term in 2020 shocked he 's actually running again there are better democrats out there
candidate obama had a rough night in debates once too democrats were hand wringing and republicans hair was on fire nothing has changed democrats hold firm for nato our allies and our military trump does not
exactly the internet makes everyone over react these days keep cool trump came across as ducking unhinged the middle ground wo n’t like that
this is n’t a bad debate you ca n’t just fix this it ’s his cognitive ability and appearance that his mental acuity is in severe decline it ’s his speech gait staring etc those images ca n’t be fixed in the mind of the american public he has got to be replaced
for everyone believing this i urge you to actually watch the obama romney debate it was not a bad debate night in the sense we saw yesterday obama still had good arguments and more importantly managed to actually speak them out loud biden looked like a late stage dementia patient everyone who ever had to deal with dementia in their family immediately must have recognized this from not being able to formulate a single coherent thought changing topic up to three times mid sentence mumbling looking around with child like wonder mouth agape apart from the one time trump went i do n't know what he said and i do n't think he did either i feel like even trump was softer than usual and held back though trump also started sundowning towards the end god help us all
i think it 's pretty clear biden is gon na stay in with no regard for how many people will suffer when he loses obama is one of those people with the influence to persuade him to step down and he 's not doing it
trump also had a terrible debate so whatever
they ’re all going to publicly back him but we all saw what happened it was terrible and alarming
if biden was in a jar like nixon in futurama i would still vote for him sorry trump would be 10x worse
i agree that bad debates happen but what does n’t just “ happen ” is looking old feeble and lost biden needs to start taking whatever it is that trump does to keep his mind moving
i ca n't believe you can all say with a straight face that the debate was anything less than an absolute catastrophe for biden the swing voters will not just follow a mindless blue tiden for the corpse of joe biden any of them that catch even a piece of that debate will either be voting for trump or not voting at all and i guarantee a lot of those are shifts away from reluctantly voting for biden originally
that was n't a bad debate it was an implosion of a campaign the reasons biden did badly are not points that can be fixed he 's done done i hope obama is just saying this to try to salvage some of biden 's reputation while they talk about replacing him behind the scenes
obama did have a bad first debate too in 2012 so this is n't surprising
unfortunately i do n't think biden debates will ever improve
feel like the dems expect too much perfection from their candidates and i understand biden is way too old my thing is this no matter what happen trump and r ’s base would have celebrated a victory one slight hiccup and y all ready to start mad max it out here
i ’ll take the skeleton that is falling apart over the one who reminds me of hitler i ’m not happy about it but it is what it is
yeah they do this was n't one of those joe biden has been in a clear decline for a while now he looks like an undertaker has done their best job with him and he can barely talk he 's done the crazy thing is that the political system is so unfit for purpose that the election is being contested between a 78 year old convicted felon and an 81 year old man who seems 10 years older than he is and the train just keeps rolling on regardless
it was n't a bad debate it was an election defining moment that came up incredibly short because of his inability to excuse himself due to illness or his inability to realize he needs to take some drugs before being in public he needs to step aside if he thinks that will save us from trump
there ’s a lot of wishful thinking on the right that they can remove trump ’s opponent
i think saying it was bad is being generous that was catastrophic
can we get obama back
democrats have gotten so lazy and way to used to pulling at least we are better than that guy all the democratic leaders coming out defending biden are not taking this situation seriously enough and alienating their base
this is the same puppet master that weekend at bernie’s’d him into his first term if he ca n’t stem the tide against biden he might be toast
you can recover from one bad night but you ca n’t recover from dementia everyone can see just step aside preserve your legacy and let younger generation take over
there 's a very easy distinction to be made here obama was n't in decline and there were no other instances of him being out of it to one degree or another we all should have expected this from biden given all that 's at stake democracy human rights the planet the gaslighting must end now
the experienced statesman with the banging economy but some trouble retrieving names vs the last place felon and rapist potus with the emotional maturity of a spoiled 7 year old industrial strength adhd and also suffering from apparent frontotemporal dementia who thinks america is n't british because washington took over the airports injecting bleach might be good for viral infections and dropping a nuke into a hurricane is a great idea yeah that 's a hard one
like who ’s not sick of trump still talking about after birth abortions like it ’s a thing
yeah but when you 're 1000 years old they happen every time still better than trump
he would know everyone was scared af after that first debate with romney started responding to those donation emails after that one
unfortunately biden ’s reality is america ’s reality
the problem is age has become but her emails ’ and actually has some validity it might be enough to make a small enough difference in swing states it ’s a tough situation think they do need to stick with biden but keep it limited to speeches earlier on in the day he basically needs thrown over the finish line then kamala can take over i ’m sure biden is still capable of decision making but it ’s hard to imagine him at this point dealing with a potential crisis call in the middle of the night or being able to maintain a busy schedule
biden won as far as i 'm concerned he answered the questions trump did n't i already knew the guy was a geriatric and that 's okay he commands the obama era voters he 's more progressive than expected in some ways and he 's been very accommodating to centrists on israel and immigration just wait until he reschedules mj rocking the entire legal industry to it 's core
biden needs to go if he is this bad at 81 what will he be at 84 ffs just put someone else up for candidacy other than these two
usually a bad debate can be corrected with a few adjustments but this was more like evidence that senility has set in and no adjustments will reverse that
what else can he say he ’s too busy counting his money from selling us out to come up with something substantive
i keep saying this debating the proverbial chess playing pigeon is useless requires a different approach
after what has been widely heralded as devastating debate performance for president biden with some calls to step down some of the president ’s allies including governor newsom senator fetterman and former president obama have elected to rally around the president according to the biden campaign the campaign has seen a record small donor donations surge similar to way we a surge though not necessarily small donor fueled from the trump campaign post conviction “ bad debate nights happen trust me i know ” obama said in a post on x a reference to his own first debate with 2012 gop nominee mitt romney which was widely viewed as a victory for the republican ”
i can understand a bad debate saying the wrong things or points not quite landing are things that can happen but biden struggled to speak basic sentences the most damning thing to me was how they immediately went to an after debate event had this been any one of us concerned loved ones would be taking us to a hospital but the general public were the only ones caught off guard by this
coping liberals are going to keep bringing up obama 's first debate with romney and how bad it was obama doing bad against romney was understandable it was n't nearly as catastrophic as last night was at least obama was going up against a seasoned politician who could make coherent arguments at least obama was n't ancient and did n't ramble and trail off like joe did
why not get a candidate who actually beats trump in a debate comparing even his 2020 showings to this one are fucking scary i think we need more dems to recognize this and call for change at the top of the ticket not pretend like this is n’t a major fucking problem stakes are too high to risk it all on this man ’s mental state on debate night
bad debates happen but being fucking old does n't change it 's not like biden 's going to get younger and more spy any time soon the decline between himself 4 years ago and now is massive no way he survives 4 more years he needs to drop the fuck out today and make way for someone fit for the job he may beat trump he may not but there 's plenty of people that would mop the floor with that idiot let them run we do n't need another feinstein
i ’ll be voting for the dem candidate but i hope biden does n’t rbg his legacy and i ’m tired of being gaslit by the dem party that biden is razor sharp when i can clearly see with my own eyes that he is n’t as well as telling everyone that this is a literal fight for democracy while not doing what they should do to make sure they win it
captain going down with the ship i guess
lol bad debate is an understatement dude had no clue where he was even at
so we still on for round 2
we know he has to say this but obama is the best speaker in decades he ’s never come close to a bad debate lol
here was biden today giving a post debate speech much stronger vote blue
i am voting mickey mouse in this election both candidates are not fit to lead
biden lost so bad even obama could n't back him up
the issue is that it 's a bad debate performance it 's the fact that the performance solidified the image that he does n't look capable of doing the job sure that really does n't matter to anyone remotely intelligent but it does matter to the idiots who will decide this election the politicians willing to back that performance afterwards are a problem too a candidate who can not form coherent sentences during a debate while losing to a convicted felon in the polls this early in the election season is not a viable candidate it 's not panic driving this discourse it 's reality
oh well bad debate nights happen i 'll take heart in framing that on my wall in a couple years if i 'm not dead or in a camp because joe had a bad debate night and hindenberged his way into giving a literal fascist supreme power
when did obama have bad debate night when did hillary have bad debate night when did george w bush have a bad debate night no obama biden 's faculties are on a steep decline we need bernie sanders
especially when you 're too old to be trusted with knives and scissors let alone an entire freakin ' country
obama has never had a bad debate night in his life
i mean he has to what the fuck is he gon na say joe sucked and trump deserves to win obviously obama wants trump gone as much as anyone
who knew a turd sandwich has an expiration date
i 'd pick a literal streaming crap over trump
if the worst case scenario is he dies in office or his cabinet has to cover for him those are both scenarios this country has faced and endured trump 's scotus just overturned chevron deference which means now we do n't get to have experts determining our policy on anything but that 's not the bad part the bad part is trump is almost definitely ratting out cia informants selling state secrets gutting the governments ability to function and actively trying to take away our right to vote the damage was bad last time but recoverable i deeply worry about what lessons he 's learned since then
sure hardcore anti trumpers but not everyone think that way dem needs every vote
most people that are commenting on the sub are going to vote biden no matter what my issue is that biden 2024 is making hillary of 2016 look like a pretty good candidate and that 's sort of an issue
this is n’t a useful comment at this moment though if it was november and biden was the option for sure right now we need to be talking about how he is not at all fit to serve another 4 years imagine him 3 years from now he lowered his already bad chances of beating trump and we need to pressure him to step aside so there is time to replace him
but that 's the decision we have to decide right now we still have time to replace him
then you 'll be fine to pick whoever we replace biden with i do n't know why the people that will vote blue no matter who are so resistant to the idea of getting someone in who is less than 80 years old
it was more than a bad day at the office stop kidding yourself i watched a replay of some of the debate this was clearly someone unfit to lead
i ’m of the same conviction however do independents that will be needed to win this november feel the same that debate freaked me out where was the guy i saw yesterday on the debate stage on friday he literally sounded like his 72 year old self
they can swap him out
how about a guy that saw millions of people dying to a preventable novel virus and had the power to help but instead just shrugged and said it is what it is to this day whenever i hear anyone use that phrase for anything it brings me back to the day i heard him say it and it makes my blood boil
what about swing voters in the northeast because trump only needs to flip about 50k of them to win and i ’m pretty sure that car crash did that
dems need more ppl than those active on r politics and a senile biden does not inspire turnout he needs to step aside and let a more capable candidate put trump down for good
false or misleading biden claims at cnn debate only president in awhile who did n’t have “ any troops dying anywhere in the world ” 15 per shot cap on insulin in medicare 200 cap on overall drug spending in medicare border now has fewer crossings then when trump was in office unemployment was at 15 % when he took office trump wants to get rid of social security billionaires pay 8 2 % in taxes trump told americans to inject bleach during covid crisis border patrol endorsed him american has a thousand trillionaires he has the most support for veterans
i ’ve been on reddit for awhile does my account make a diff
the default usernames that reddit suggests when making an account are usually two words 4 numbers
yep either bots or the maga crowd just started showing up here in force
i posted about this before in a different sub it ’s always wordword4numbers it was started about 3 years ago but picked up heavily in the lead up to the ukraine russia war
it 's like they want us to notice too i guess russian interference is just one more topic russia and the republican party can use to divide the u s
uhhh reddit picked my name for me
i have four numbers and i 'm a real person and right now i 'm a real frutrated person instead of the lurker i normally am edit sorry i have 6 numvers i guess i do n't even know my account name
it 's the format for auto generated reddit usernames i stuck with one reddit generated for me 'cause it amused my fat ass
republican tactic for the debate they 'll calm down over time just expect this as apart of republican tactics 101 also foreign states might be joint in the fun it 's getting harder and harder to tell republicans from russians at this point
maybe they ’ve been deleted though i do n’t see any “ deleted comments ” on mobile but i have n’t seen a single account you ’re referring to possible the mods stepped in i ’m a biden supporter fwiw and just want to see donny get destroyed this election so he can retire from the public sphere edit i ’m dumb i misread your comment i thought they only had four numbers not ended in four numbers
wait i have 4 numbers i just needed something cause the default was taken
a lot of us have been ignorance is bliss ing this election cycle tuned in to watch trump embarrass himself and instead got hit by a train
this sub has been completely manufactured for a long time no way real people craft multi paragraph comments stroking off biden
it 's almost like that 's how reddit generates user names but a conspiracy is more fun
there is one singular play here one take the house pick up seats in the senate to protect against the defectors and hold the presidency at that point they could add seats to the bench that ’s the play they are completely untouchable otherwise
what plan should they implement to get the supreme court in line
if biden was proposing expanding the court i would agree he does n't even want to get the supreme court in line we need a reformer
the best way to do that is to pick a democrat that can finish a cohesive sentence without a teleprompter and or is n't historically unpopular there 's only two candidates that can screw this up joe biden and hillary clinton as long as we pick any other democrat we 'll crush trump and get the next set of supreme court picks i 'm a progressive and do n't like gavin newsom but if the establishment choses him i 'll give him all the support in the world he 's good at debating he 's a skilled politician he 'll kick trump 's ass the convention will be amazing to watch i 'll even be excited
right biden ’s time on the judiciary committee is unmatched we definitely need a president who helps get justices like clarence thomas confirmed to the supreme court
like essentially at this point you 're voting for 1 his cabinet and 2 the fact that he 's not trump his administration has done a decent job the last four years but i would like the person i voted for to be the one dictating policies and not a cabal of cabinet members and at this point i 'm entirely sure that 's happening and if 1 does n't sit well with you then literally any other democratic candidate fulfills 2 and if it 's kamela harris who 's running then there 's absolutely nothing unique about biden they 're presenting this a fait accompli but can you imagine if they actually held a primary debate there 's no way joe would be on the ticket right now
i 'm voting for biden or whoever runs with d by their name but holy fucking shit please pick someone who is actually lucid why should they if you 're gon na vote for him or her anyway
even if biden aced the debate we still would be in for a hard fight this was n't a disastrous debate this was the death knell of the current administration he should have dropped out he should n't have even run in the first place we should have had an obama instead we have a dinosaur against a fascist our best bet is literally for him to expire from age before the election
the last time a debate was so damaging was kennedy vs nixon
meanwhile trump 's words get glossed over because biden is held to a different standard it 's lazy
and 2 out of 3 lost so even if it was just a bad night it was n't peope should be concerned i 'm very concerned there 's a fat lot of good i can do but lose sleep and post frustratedly to forums to let it out someone from the biden camp needs to come forward and take a hit for this like whoever prepped him
i ’m not clear that the skills required for debating track well with the skills required for governing
besides trump wo n’t ever agree to a second debate
the thought of obama ’s “ bad ” 2012 debate almost brought tears he spoke eloquently articulate red good policy but got cornered by romney on a few points the media focused in on as if it were career ending joe biden had trouble making sentences last night he had trouble saying simple words he could n’t keep a line of thought he needed assistance to move down a small step he ’s cognitively unfit to hold any job really let alone potus
and it needs to be said that the people who are calling for him to step down would still vote for him if he decides not to the motivating factor here is to defeat trump not to convince anyone not to vote for him
or literally any of the 2020 democratic nominee 's
in the u s we do n't really have a mechanism to have a vote of no confidence and choose a different leader other than the primary elections which have essentially wrapped up and democrats certainly are n't going to initiate the impeachment process against a president from their own party because a bad debate performance does n't qualify as a high crime or misdemeanor nobody with a serious chance in the democratic party challenged biden this year because challenging an incumbent president within the same party for the nomination is almost always an unsuccessful endeavor ted kennedy in 1980 running against president carter is a prime example that only accomplishes weakening the incumbent party 's chances carter later lost to reagan that november in a landslide as a result of this unfortunate political reality instead of having a realistic chance of choosing newsom whitmer beshear or pritzker any of which could have wiped the floor with trump last night no other potentially viable nominees emerged and biden won the nomination easily i 'm still hoping biden wins because we 've got to keep trump out but i think choosing him as the nominee in 2020 was far from the best option we had available at the time only bloomberg would have been worse last night proved it
it ’s not about should ’ we already had the primaries and biden won which makes him the candidate he ’s not dropping out which means he continues to be the candidate the way to get a different candidate is to go back in time if you want to lend us your time machine maybe we can talk about a different candidate until then the choice is biden or trump
i honestly ca n't believe biden really wants to run again he wants to spend his twilight years juggling national emergencies i really think he was talked into by the dnc which makes where we 're at now even more egregious
there 's no reason for trump to do another one republicans do n't need to see trump again and biden could n't have done worse if he tried the trump camp would be smart if they just did ads playing biden at his best during the debate
trump ’s winning he wo n’t risk a second debate he ’ll just say he ’s done it the format is rigged and do a rally instead especially if the dems sub in another candidate who would destroy him in a debate
he should nt be at the next one i want to know who is actually calling the shots as president biden clearly is not capable of doing that fully its so fucking embarrassing that this is what its down to a felon crook rapist failed businessman insurectionist traitor vs a zombie what the fuck is wrong with us i will not vote for either of them
not unless he finds the fountain of youth the man has severely declined
doubtful even if he had a “ cold ” that ’s biden improvising public speaking the only reason he can give some semblance of coherence at other public events is because he ’s reading off a prompter and honestly trump seemed really tame last night he was reserved and not super combative aside from that he was a pathological narcissist and liar if he really wanted to open the throttle on biden and throw biden off his game at the next debate it would n’t be hard to do at all there ’s a lot of room for trump to gaslight biden into an incoherent frenzy even if biden could muster looking more with it trump could handedly spin him around a few times and watch him collapse to the floor in confusion last night was n’t just a bad night it was the beginning of the end and there wo n’t be many other high water marks for biden between now and election day the best anyone can hope for is that the low water marks do n’t any lower but it ’s pretty damning if our greatest hopes for biden are that successfully strings words together to complete entire sentences if that ’s where the bar is going to be trump ’s already won
if he ca n’t then that ’s more justification that he is n’t the right candidate for this election is trump winning is truly an existential crisis to the future of american democracy like almost every democratic leader has consistently said it is or is that just a talking point i believe it is more than a talking point and if it is then the democratic party needs to put up a candidate who can consistently go out in public settings on a daily basis and effectively communicate a message both against trump and for their candidacy biden obviously completely shit the bed at doing that last night and if he ca n’t do waaaayyy better than that he has no chance at defeating trump and therefore needs to withdraw from the election
so much denial of this itt
2016 should have been a wake up call and it was n’t i ’m convinced democrats want to lose at this point
candidate obama did n’t look like this this is an unmitigated disaster people are trying to compare it to reagan ’s debate against mondale when he lost and were saying well there is a track record for cognitively rough debates where the candidate still wins i watched it last night biden had the worst debate in modern history not even close reagan is making jokes and is coherent we are being gaslit that what we saw was n’t real or indicative of biden ’s leadership we need a new candidate now
i think his first debate with romney he looked awful obama came back though and was in prime form for their third debate
nothing annoys me more than seeing waves of dems just absolutely drop the ball on the candidate they 've been supporting for years now because of a bad debate it feels like a party of a bunch of phoneys absolutely dissapointing to see that 's the one thing the republicans have over us they stuck with trump 's ass as he completely lied on national television in front of millions if dems had half of that loyalty we would n't have 3 4 of the party asking to replace our nominee seriously it makes us all look fickle as fuck
what biden mumbled like a barely animated corpse and started riffing about rapists when asked about abortion he needs to go now or trump wins
yeah to me it 's just like that first romney obama debate everyone though obama was doomed but then the polls in a week or two looked the same
trump only looked bad to those who were already not voting for trump but the people you actually need to convince god no they saw this as a clear example of ' sleepy joe ' being true and worse all the comments in conservative and centrist communities online that i see all speak about how bad biden is not a word about trumps lies because they believe him and do n't really care for fact or reason it 's the flashy statements and confidence that they are attracted to the populist leader donal trump not sleepy joe who looks like he 's suffering with dementia you want to actually win votes you need someone with more charisma and wit than donal trump which is n't a high bar but for some fkin reason it is for the democrats america will lose its democracy if biden does n't step down
i ’ve been a dem since 2017 and a raging progressive also i want him to step down after this it was just embarrassing and anyone saying anything else is being gaslit or just not remembering how bad he performed we need a new candidate
the mad thing is you 're just thinking of the election what 's going to happen if biden does win and he continues to decline like this nobody is voting for kamala harris but she could very easily be president in the next couple of years the whole thing is a shit show
you ca n’t just fix this trump 's 34 felony convictions is cool his call for israel to finish palestine is cool his call for tens of millions of deportations is cool but biden 's debate performance is a campaign ender
just looked and sounded like an old man getting over a cold to me the dementia and cognitive decline accusations from both sides is just getting old people sun downing are n't making it to multiple public events speeches and debates
trump knew he had crushed the debate off handedly he started saying how he wished biden had a good presidency and that he could have just retired that was trump plunging the dagger he could not have dreamed for a better debate than last night
for everyone believing this i urge you to actually watch the obama romney debate it was not a bad debate night in the sense we saw yesterday obama still had good arguments and more importantly managed to actually speak them out loud biden looked like a late stage dementia patient everyone who ever had to deal with dementia in their family immediately must have recognized this it ’s funny that you mention the personal family quip because what i see with president biden is actually reminiscent of the stutter i saw a family member struggle with growing up nyu steinhardt communicative sciences and disorders professor eric s jackson explains that “ a common misconception is that stuttering is obvious when it occurs however many instances of stuttering go unnoticed speech interruptions can be subtle and imperceptible to listeners and may not look like “ obvious ” stuttering especially to non expert observers ” pertinent to the president ’s performance last night he goes on to explain that”in an attempt to head off these negative reactions speakers may stop speaking before stuttering becomes noticeable or they may change words or say “ uh ” or “ um ” if they know they are about to overtly stutter “ having watched a loved one struggle having thoughts but struggling to communicate them well it is very disheartening watching all you reddit “ doctors ” perpetuate the plight of those who struggle with speech impediments from not being able to formulate a single coherent thought changing topic up to three times mid sentence mumbling looking around with child like wonder mouth agape this part of the post is maybe equally saddening in that it manifest the superficiality of our politics it ’s difficult not to note the absence of more substantive criticism of his performance while i do believe there are substantive criticisms that can leveled at the president nearly all of it has been focused at the more superficial aspects of his performance
someone i know who is a doctor said he looked like a parkinson ’s patient
you said pretty much what i ’ve been saying all day for me the most frightening things were the vacant looks and open mouth something i ’ve seen in parkinson ’s patients it was just that they let him go out in that condition strangely shortly afterward he was much different energetic and well spoken so what happened in the intervening moments maybe nothing but there is a stark contrast between the two settings and guess what he still had a cold at the 2nd event why not still “ out of it ” the explanation “ it ’s hard to debate a liar ” does n’t fly that ’s why he prepped for days and if you ca n’t debate the liar for 1 5 hours you ca n’t be president for 4 years
also watch biden debate paul ryan while you ’re at it if you want to blame him looking old on his stutter
apart from the one time trump went i do n't know what he said and i do n't think he did eithe which was weird because with headphones on it was very loud and clear he said asylum officers but the mic was too quiet and biden was too quiet and people listening on their phones probably ca n't hear it i 'm not sure how much of it was biden speaking too softly and how much of it was cnn not turning up his mic volume i 'm sure it was a bit of both but still with headphones on it was clear as day
i would n't call it wonder it 's closer to fear it 's i 'm not quite sure what 's going on and what i 'm supposed to be doing next and then some cue rings a bell in their brain and they start off on what they think they 're supposed to do say next
completely agree people are falling in line with precedence and are terrified to actually act
they ’re all going to publicly back him they 're attempting to gaslight the world and tell us you did n't see what you saw incredible hubris
i guarantee you they would have had rolls reversed if the debate was at 9 am biden would be coherent and mind lucid while trumps adderall or whatever meth cocktail he takes has n’t kicked in yet
yes of course but i ’d be excited to have a different more viral democrat in a heartbeat
the reasons biden did badly are not points that can be fixed he 's done done if only he had 34 criminal convictions and called for mass deportations he 'd still be in the race and we would n't be saying he 's done
this is such a dumb thought process reagan lost his first debate in a terrible manner hillary won all of the debates and lost debates have zero predictive value and little effect on elections
these posts are delusional biden is the candidate full stop that 's not going to change
people are voting to stop trump if they see him again back in proper form they 'll latch back on this is n't a deathblow not yet at least but if someone is n't making a contingency plan right now they 're insane
i hope obama is just saying this to try to salvage some of biden 's reputation while they talk about replacing him behind the scenes i would say they want total support for joe in public but behind the scenes they are telling joe he must make the decision to withdraw and announce it so it does nt seem as if he was pushed
if it was as bad as obama was saying then obama would n’t say it at all he would have rather claimed a win or at least a draw but the fact he admired that it was “ bad debate night ” means it is as bad as you just described and much worse we are doomed but i knew that for a while
i hope obama is just saying this to try to salvage some of biden ’s reputation while they talk about replacing him behind the scenes our only hope
he was 30 years younger than both candidates now at the time so there ’s the difference
when biden was asked about abortion he rambled about women getting raped by their in laws that 's something you consider a slight hiccup you think expecting the president to actually talk about abortion when asked about it is expecting too much perfection holy shit dude take a step back and get some perspective
based on what happened last night it will be mad max in the us come january
trump called for putting 12 million people into concentration camps preparing them for deportation but biden 's bad debate night was election definding how do people support this insane double standard with such enthusiasm
biden stepping aside will lose the democrats the election plain and simple you will lose the incumbent boost and you will have a contentious primary that will lose you the election
he asked for the debate lmao it was by his rules his timeframe everything was hand picked by the biden camp coincidentally enough he was sick just as the debate ruled around funny how he was n't sick today when he was at that rally however
i think they are hoping he is n't removed so it 's a slam dunk biden last night loses without a doubt
also the reason why bernie did n’t win the 2020 primaries
with his wife being very nancy reagan about it you did a good job you answered the questions he lied she needs to stop leading her husband around by the hand but then again i 'm in the camp that is convinced he will not be the nominee i think this has been figured out already i 'm convinced this is a show
lmfao he ’s also old though not as incoherent as biden and the democratic socialist label is not going to fly with centrists or those worried about inflation progressives are not as electable as people think they are they regularly lose to centrists because the people vote for the more moderate candidate
go support your leader who consistently shits his damn pants how is no one talking about how everyone around him has said he smells of shit he wears diapers for god sakes how is this not enough what timeline is this jesus christ but yeah biden is old omggggg s
oh shoot if only he had stored nuclear secrets next to his toilet then we could trust him these double standards are insane
he could endorse kamala harris for the democratic ticket
“ they ’re the same picture ” pam
i 'd pick a dead deer that got ran over by the redneck who is planning to vote for trump over trump
i would elect the flaming bag of dog shit i placed on the neighbor 's porch in the ' 90s over trump
me too unfortunately it ’s not about what we would will do it ’s about those 3 % wishywashy morons
how about a turd sandwich
98 % of all cities voters today “ well i do n’t like him so i ’ll take this piece of shit instead of that one ”
alright everyone you know what to do write in netflix if enough people do we can just watch all the bad netflix shows for the next 3 5 years and then hopefully try again s
the most boy way i ’d believe they ’d cover up biden being unfit is to if they ’re close to the two year mark otherwise it really does n’t matter if he steps down so long as the democrats win
source on selling secrets source on ratting out cia employees do you have sources for anything or do you just have a strong “ hunch ” lol biden is n’t your friend he ’s not going to facetime you because you posted this comment lol it just makes you look uneducated
i do n't even look at it as a trump biden decision i look at it as a pro fascist vs pro democracy i 'll take democracy
exactly saying i “ r politics ” user will vote for him means nothing what matters is what undecideds and sway able voters think and they just had their biggest concern about biden confirmed in a big way on the biggest stage ignoring what they saw or trying to minimize it will not end well obama and clinton will always side with establishment power and are now steering us into a 2nd trump term just like they steered us into the 1st one
more people died under bidens presidency
most people on this sub are voting d regardless of who is on the ticket replacing him after that performance is my preferred option tbh
you have more than four numbers you 're clean
i 'm so old back in my day it was two words and three numbers
after getting banned so many times you stop caring what your name is
and they low to pretend they 're a fellow liberal while not sounding anything like liberal
it seems that way since last night
hmm 3 numbers i guess that 's okay
russia scarcely needs to interfere in the us anymore it 's such an internally fractured microcosm of paranoia suspicion and prejudice that the whole thing has become self sustaining now russian interference has no doubt exacerbated things at crucial points in time but america also really needs to start seriously reckoning with the fact that the majority of its problems are internally generated as a country it seems especially susceptible to seeding division by foreign powers at some point americans will also have to start asking themselves why they in particular are more susceptible to such seeding than others
man i just do n't care what my username is so i let reddit choose it
yeah dude it is n't that the entire country just watched the shambling corpse of biden mumble incoherently for an hour and a half it must be those darn russians again every piece of bad news that you do n't like is definitely russian propaganda you nailed it
they pick it for bots too
same here i never knew it was a thing i woulda tried for something else had i known damn
i literally tuned in for we beat medicare i screamed
biden is mid at best maggots are fanatically devoted to trump they chose trump over family life long friends workplaces stores artists and anything he demands 2020 voters galvanized against trump biden had one job slay the dragon he missed and now we ’re all fucked fucked fucked
aww look at you trying to influence the election so cute
that 's not even possible they would need a super super majority in the senate at least 67 but probably closer to 75 votes to really make a difference that is simply impossible given the way the senate works people do n't seem to realize this the kind of change this country needs is n't possible via legislation or voting it 's going to take protest and massive demonstrations and that 's just the start
it 's very funny that you think this is a real possibility it 's even funnier that you think the democrats would actually do anything with that kind of a majority
fucking anything should be on the table
i ’m so perplexed why this has n’t already happened last night was a disaster for this country if rbgv2 insists on running ofc i ’ll vote but i ’ve seen this play out exactly the same once before anointed nominees do not energize voters
tim ryan made a great point on cnn last night that jfk kept us out of starting ww3 in the 60s with the cuban missle crisis he personally stood up to our own war hawkish generals we have no one at the helm to be a part of this conversation why would this not be factored into the conversation of replacing biden as the candidate
to be fair nixon almost won that race
nixon was guided off stage by his wife for his own good at the end either
the standard at this point is stringing three sentences together
biden was the first presidential debater to look like he belonged in assisted living rather than the white house
i 'm with you friend also losing sleeping and being frustrated it was awful do n't let the deniers on here get you down replacing him would be my preferred option
i do n't know what he said i do n't think he knows what he just said i hate trump but that line was a nuclear fucking bomb that quote perfectly captured the entire debate and was the one thing out of trump 's mouth that was actually true it does n't matter if you can speak decently and keep it together sometimes if you 're president you ca n't have moments like that if we get attacked at 1 am and the president has to jump out of bed and start making decisions is the confused old man we saw last night who we want at the helm in that moment i 'd vote for a moldy towel over trump but we have to admit that biden is all there anymore the dude is acting like my grandpa did in his last 2 demented months of life
he successfully beat medicare though we ’re so screwed
they 'll say it 's his stutter that was non existent for the last several decades lol
i do n’t think it requires impeachment biden just needs to be convinced that he ca n’t run and then he withdraws before your convention he remains president till the new person trump or whoever is sworn in in january as other people have said i think we need to forget about historical precedents because these are unprecedented times
they can choose a different candidate at the convention
if he does n't drop out it shows that he does n't have the ability or judgement to do what is best for the country
you know that many people were trying to warn you guys about this exact outcome long before the primaries began and you shouted all of us down and insisted that biden was perfectly fine oh well you made your bed now you get to lie in it
ok re read that and think who you are talking about trump camp would be smart yep they 'll debate him again
should trump refuse a 2nd one then biden camp should do an early morning one where they just play trump 's lies and rebut them with receipts and explain how the firehose of falsehoods work and that this is their method of countering it
neither trump nor his campaign are smart so they will do another debate and joe biden will shockingly to dems everywhere still be a senile old man at this debate
counter point if they refuse it opens them up to biden did badly last time what are they afraid of by september this will be old news for the most part
if he does n’t trump will look weak by dodging the doddering old man i am not sure what he will do if they do debate again i m not expecting much better from biden
but will biden do that
the delusions in this subreddit are honestly mindblowing
uh biden said we beat medicare and froze straight up could not keep a straight thought through a sentence spin all you want that dude is toast and we ’re toast if he stays in get a foreign passport the gop is all but calling for political violence against democrats if trump wins it ’s going to be ugly for college graduates
so you get harris and the current administration she finishes out his term and then runs for her own no problem with that
ok so we have president harris does n’t really matter so long as sane people control the white house
like many people here i will vote for biden in november if he 's still on the ballot but all the problems with trump are precisely why biden should step aside we need someone with a better chance of winning in an election where the stakes are so high
yeah that 's if you do n't replace biden the number of voters who are biden or i 'm not voting can be counted in one hand
i will grant u all your arguments it is biden ’s mental state you ca n’t be blind this is about replacing him not voting for trump you ca n’t have a man in that condition as president pick harris gavin manchin anyone
i do n't understand comments like this it 's like you do n't want to win
every trump supporter prays biden stays in the race and is n’t replaced that says it all
they are not held to the same standard and stakes are high it is not fair but it 's reality
so just so i understand you correctly calling for israel to finish palestine is unacceptable to you but actually giving the weapons to israel to finish palestine is perfectly fine that 's your stance
54 million people seeing our current dem president shit the bed is not cool and it would be irresponsible of us as a party to nominate someone who loses to trump in a debate damn people here really are believing the spin here so hard millions of people are forever changed by what happened on thursday i do n’t even know if i can believe my own party anymore
guy is that all you have what about bs
when it comes to winning the election yes everything you said is true maga idiots can look past the felony convictions mostly apathetic voters who think biden is too old are not gon na look past this debate american politics are stupid but this is the reality we live in the way things are going biden can not win this election
this is n't a question of whether biden is worse than trump it 's a question of whether biden is worse than some other candidate we could run in his place who does n't have his liabilities biden is not irreplaceable there is no consensus who that someone else should be but lots of people could do better than what we saw last night
when asked about abortion biden started going on a racist tirade about how immigrants are raping american citizens this is not “ getting over a cold ” he somehow managed to spectacularly fumble one of the easiest slam dunks over one of the most important issues this election biden has lost the plot
ahh yes so you are gon na believe what everyone else is selling you i know what i saw it was embarrassing and as a party we need to do better he lost to the worse candidate in history i ca n’t even pretend to support him anymore we need a new candidate now
this is absolutely valid i reject it ’s a reason he can win voters will not see past the presentation
the explanation “ it ’s hard to debate a liar ” does n’t fly exactly so what kind of opponent did the dnc think biden would be facing someone who will stick to facts and make mathematically rational arguments its fucking trump the actual problem with this apocalyptic asswhopping biden received can be summed it with trump i still have a pulse hm okay biden i still have a pulse gon na need some proof for that chief that 's all we saw but apparently everything is fine according to obama let 's just sleepwalk from weimar america to nazi america so we can go full circle
someone else mentioned parkinson ’s that would be a blessing in disguise it would give him a way to bow out respectfully
also watch biden debate paul ryan while you ’re at it if you want to blame him looking old on his stutter “ the severity of stuttering symptoms varies significantly from person to person and depends on ever changing real life circumstances some people may stutter in certain situations but speak fluently in others that said just because someone who stutters can speak with fluency sometimes does n't mean they will speak without a stammer all the time ” like i said there ’s legitimate criticism you could level at the president “ he should have said this or that ” however that is n’t really what i ’m hearing reading watching the country react to his disability does help illustrate why fdr felt the need to conceal his own disability
so all i needed to do when i watch a debate edge of my seat television btw is listen to it super loudly while wearing headphones so that i can understand the soft spoken mumbling one that ’s asking way too much of the average american voter with these two candidates just be grateful the average person who does n’t really follow politics actually took the time to watch it they ’ll most likely just watch the highlights but more like lowlights
me too me too sometimes the hero is just a regular person though not viral not cool just willing to do the right thing
do n't forget about black jobs
that 's just usa being a lunatic is n't a deal breaker in the united states being weak is
trump sucks you agree so do most on this sub biden is senile no amount of what about bs will cover that up
nope we just need him to be able to be able to remember where he is both in the day time and in the night time no one wants a president who forgets how to speak when the sun goes down replace biden with an actually viable dem
as i said to he reason for the loss is important mainstream america now thinks the guy we saw in the debate is the guy biden is most of his life he did n't lose based on something fixable like a bad messaging he lost because he has an unfixable fatal flaw
did you watch the same thing as the rest of us it was absolutely tragic
typically presidential debates have little effect on elections but they can it 's not impossible and it has happened before especially when in the highest profile and most viewed first debate one of the candidates spends almost the entire duration playing into no not just playing into but proving that his worst political liability is factually true obama did bad in his first debate in 2012 obama 's poor performance in 2012 was not even in the same league that was talking heads nitpicking obama not being on his a game but instead being on his b game biden 's performance in last night 's debate was the worst of all time and will have a political impact catastrophic is the right word and
debates have zero predictive value categorical statement easily disproven by jfk vs nixon
they do when there is likely only 1 debate
he ’s too old even if he somehow won he would die in office
they have to try to ratchet up support right now just incase biden is what they 're stuck with
it ’s his fault to begin with bernie was about to win the 2020 primaries until barack was behind the scenes telling everyone else to drop out
because that 's literally what trump supporters want
because trump is who he is and his voters do n’t care biden showed last night that he is n’t what he was that ’s the difference the optics of an elderly man looking lost and feeble on stage are n’t going away it sunk nixon and it will sink biden
because trump can suck in the same world as biden being too senile
because we know who trump is that 's a feature to his voters biden looked close to death and could n't even form a sentence our allies were watching and it was embarrassing is that who you want on the center stage we can criticize biden without whataboutism for trump
the issue is not a lack of faith in biden 's policies it 's a lack of faith in his ability to oppose the guy who wants to put millions in concentration camps we need a fighter fucking duh
because there is no more biden yes everything biden stands for and manages to say when lucid is factually correct yes trump is lying through his teeth as soon as he opens his maw no it does n't matter if the man himself is right now dipping his second leg in the grave because people imagine him sitting in the oval office no more than 6 feet away from the football unsure if he still knows his own name you can make an argument saying you vote for kamala and the party as well not just one guy but that begs the question why not have her run for president then why pretend everything is fine going to far as to run obvious lies as damage control he has a cold lmao and gaslight their own electorate into believing all is well instead of taking voters concern seriously yes trump is a liar right now i also think the entire dnc is a liar too like the gop if everyone is lying and bullshitting us anyway does it make sense to want this system to continue or should democrats maybe also start marching on the capitol
there is no incumbent boost when no one is a biden fan anyways every post regarding this elections is democrats saying they 'd vote for a corpse as long as they have a d next to their name so put in someone not on the brink of death and put a d next to their name
what incumbent boost his poll numbers have been under water for well over a year now
you would n’t have a contentious primary because you would n’t have a primary those have happened already
i never watch debates since i can read policy ideas online rather than listen to soundbites however apparently between these two old men biden sounded like an exhausted grandpa in need of a nap while trump sounded like a methed out peepaw i ca n't imagine anyone changed their votes no matter who lost but i get why people are disappointed after all ds wanted trump to start taking about sharks and electric boats in the middle of a diaper change while rs wanted biden to yank off his mask and reveal he was an actor and the election was all a movie
this republicans and conservatives see him as a pushover and want him locked in
this whole ordeal is dredging up all sorts of democratic party malfeasance from the recent past
i hope you 're right but i fear biden is too proud to step down and no one in his inner circle has the courage to tell him he should
i have never voted republican and probably never will that does n't mean i like biden he 's too damn old to be trusted with this sort of responsibility and trump should have been in jail years ago why ca n't the dnc find anyone worthy to paraphrase aaron sorkin if democrats are so star spangled awesome how come they lose so god damn always
that 's the problem at any other time in history it 'd be just hilarious that anyone would even consider trump for a traffic cop let alone a president that man is so obviously a corrupt gasbag that he should n't be let anywhere near this kind of power and against any other opponent it 'd be completely easy to beat him maybe not the first time because even he did n't think he 'd win the first time but this second time there should n't be any issue with kicking trump down the street all the dnc had to do is prop up a candidate that could speak coherently and rattle off the talking points but this is where we are the dnc ca n't even do that all biden had to do was ' stay standing ' and ' not have a senior moment ' but here we are a vile corrupt racist criminal is going to beat the dnc because apparently there are no other candidates they think have a better chance at beating trump
yeah hopefully he is working on that behind the scenes
hey poop has a really important place in the circle of life trump 's not even worth that all things considered
orange fool just admitted on live tv he knew his master putin woul invade ukraine and orange fool did nothing if you 've been paying any attention at all you know there is no choice now there 's just biden
so you 'll still vote blue if we replace biden then
sounds like something a bot would say about another bot i bet you 've never passed a replicate test have you it 's robots all the way down i tells ya
eh i just decided my old account had enough identifying information on it that it was time for a new account about time i move onto a new one again
it ’s not just here i ’ve seen soo many posts in different subs with this weird hand wringing faux sympathy for biden it all just reminds me of when everybody decided they just could n’t vote for hillary because of her emails and we all know how that ended
as a leftist i am voted democrat party in most of the last few elections all of we americans are knowing that democrat party is not always sane but after this obvious biden is being senile and not caring for us americans now i will to vote trump who obviously having passion and care about issues also every other leftist i hung out with saying they walk away now from crooked democrats party is sad to seeing so clear now that they only caring about their own powers
i got downvotes for saying this would happen
a criticism of biden is n’t an endorsement for trump besides should n’t political subs be a forum for open discussions between different opinions anyways
comments were down for a while likely reddit had to degrade it from all the bot activity last night it looked there were biden needs to step down articles being posted every minute
literally every thread about joe biden has the showing fanning the flames
it seems that way since last night there were so many comments in the megathread that were a variation of we 're so fucked comments that would have been posted during the outage it crossed my mind that the spike in traffic was caused by a hoard of bots being unleashed during the debate that it was only comments that were fucked while everything else was fine was curious
fair but my numbers are actually a word and a joke a stupid joke but a joke
i thought youtube was crawling with bots for this very reason but there it ’s the account persons name 4 numbers i probably called a lot of real people bots over my ignorance welp
vote third party imo the more people that do it the greater message that is sent otherwise we continue to feed into this political 2 party circus biden clearly is n’t leading this country and requires handlers all day trump is n’t much better
you guys would rather enter maga levels of conspiracy instead of accepting the fact that joe biden destroyed himself last night
it only takes the will of 51 in the senate manchin and sinema voted with all the republicans to block the nuclear option to restore abortion access had they voted with the democrats the filibuster would be dead and they could have expanded the court with 51 there has yet to be 51 with the will i wonder if they ’ll muster it for an abortion ban 2 3 majority is constitutionally required for impeachment and treaties iirc nothing to my knowledge requires 3 4
i feel like that 's a little extreme
you do n't see the irony in ' defending democracy ' by saying that
absolutely when you 're not the person facing accountability to the american people your decision making factors are different
in also to be fair the debate was not dominated by kennedy like history would have us believe also the main reason kennedy won was he misled the american people about some foreign policy nixon was involved in basically painting nixon as a culprit when in fact nixon was privy to classified information and could n't speak about it on the stage would n't of stopped trump
yet he spoke the truth while dullards lapped up trump 's lies bigotry and racism
agree potus is the ultimate difficult stressful challenging job 24 7 and for four years nonstop it takes a visible toll on every single one of them that holds this office it ’s not a job suited for the advanced elderly or frail to put it mildly aside from our democracy hanging in the balance on this election we can not afford to have an impaired and diminished person running the country and managing global firestorms it ’s way too risky our adversaries were certainly taking notes on that debate and we need to consider how it can embolden them to see us being helmed by someone who can not even communicate or carry a thought it ’s devastating and the implications are all bad most msm seem to indicate that biden himself is the ultimate “ decider ” of whether he should step down well it ’s clear he can not see himself clearly at this point most people who reach this stage ca n’t then it ’s up to the loved ones around them to take away the keys and steer them into a safe harbor before something bad happens it ’s a painful and difficult thing to do but our country is at stake and it ’s not okay to hand wave and pretend it ’s all gon na be okay
and for saying that i get downvoted the denial of r politics would be hilarious if the stakes were n’t so high
i do n't think we should forget about historical precedents but we should be mindful that we are in a time when such historical precedents can be upended the issue in this particular case is that the primaries have already essentially concluded biden has clinched the nomination and unless he himself decides to bow out and free up his delegates to choose another nominee which is extremely unlikely he will be the nominee in november unless he dies or has a major health emergency
they made all our beds and when trump wins they 'll tell us it was all our fault
i would n’t count on it trump stayed out of the primary debates and it was clearly the right move i expect there wo n’t be a second debate
i think something has changed with trumps strategy he was much more tame than the last debate with biden unless something changes the dems shit the bed completely
vs the smarts of the campaign team that just handed trump the election
for a camp that is n’t smart the democrats ca n’t lay a glove reread that and think
and democrats who will vote d will love it and no one else will watch
yes of course biden got through all of the debates in 2020 primaries and the 2020 general elections debates he also had a proven record of beating trump
if you really want to lose switch candidates it 's going to be hilarious when all the polls come out showing that biden is still doing fine
yep i am also voting for harris as a backup because harris is a million times better than trump and whatever maga sycophant he picks if biden drops dead a week after the inaguration i would be sad for his family but happy harris was in charge instead of trump
exactly harris is a qualified african american woman who ’s the next best thing after her newsom he can be vp or better yet kamala and whitmer would be a great ticket too
well i think that could cause issues for one harris is n't a very popular figure and whilst the vice president has always been somone who could potentially step into the top job that 's usually unexpected and not something that looks like a very real possibility going into the election that puts a bit of a different slant on this one for me and there 's also the fact that if harris did assume power because of something to do with biden 's age then the republicans would have an absolute field day with it and i could easily imagine her mandate being heavily challenged both on capitol hill and around the country my point was n't as one dimensional as you made it out to be
it does matter otherwise america would have a parliamentary democracy where people vote for parties and not individuals but it does n't have a system like the uk where it 's the party that is in charge and the leader of the party is the leader of the country it has its own system because america has decided that it definitely matters to them
comments like this which deal in observable reality are simply describing what just took place wishful thinking gets you 2016 he is n't up to it that 's the hand how dems play it various options but currently it 's a losing hand that 's just how it is
if you say anything bad about biden that means you love trump do n’t you know that s last night was a disaster biden needs to yield to someone else for all of our sakes he ’s not getting better with time we ca n’t afford to let trump win
it ’s literally a binary choice right now it ’s not a what about
this is literally the only example i have seen and it was a single sentence in a much longer and more coherent answer i also am pretty sure that he was trying to say they keep talking about how immigrants are commiting violence against women but do not care about women when it comes to the reproductive health he also never said that immigrants were raping women he was saying that they likely trump 's camp but maybe the news was focusing on a single case of a woman being killed by an immigrant and not on the countless cases of women in jeopardy because of the lack of roe the bit about rape was clearly about how they are not even making an exception for women who are being rape was it easy to understand what he meant absolutely not he was really struggling with blocks in that paragraph and so he was having trouble completing sentences he just jumped between 3 real points but did not finish any of them he recovered after trump 's response probably took a breath and reorganized his thoughts and the second part of his answer to the question was pretty good there were other problems in the debate but i think this one keeps getting brought up over and over because it is one of the few where it was super unclear what he meant even after reading the transcripts i mean it was obvious to me but i also can generally follow what trump means when he says nonsense so i might just have a talent for it
true all true and the more i hear the more this is all a little stinky again more of “ do n’t believe your lyin ’ eyes ” usually we get it from republicans this is from democrats today i ’ve heard “ he has a cold ” “ he over prepped like a colonoscopy ca n’t debate like he used to hard to debate a liar and a then a total 180 turn around very weird
biden has been a very good and maybe great president i 'm going to believe their actions we 've already had 4 years or nearly 4 years under both of these guys we 've seen the repercussions of both of them as well we 've seen roe v wade reversed along with other egregious supreme court decisions trump accomplished pretty much nothing in office he used his powers to capture and imprison people across the us during the protests and riots of 2020 he cozies up to dictators wants to turn back on alliances and treaties with our allies
so infuriating that we ca n't talk about how biden should not be running without being accused of supporting trump if biden runs were all cooked leaving him in the race and chalking it up as a bad debate is a disaster
seriously anyone daring to question biden is accused of being a trump supporter wtf it ’s my fear of trump being elected that is causing me to question biden ’s electability post debate he ’s done great but he has clearly degraded and needs to step down we ca n’t risk having him degrade further over the next few months and losing more support this is too important i ’m convinced anyone else could easily beat trump
i actually do n’t mind a biden presidency there ’s enough competent people he ’s put in the executive branch that this country will be fine if he were to remain president the problem is that he ’s not going to turn out voters who think that being a very old man is the same as being a very old conman it ’s not that either is a bad choice it ’s that one we ’d be fine and the other we ’d have a n immediate constitutional crisis so what i ’m concerned about is not whether biden would be a bad president it ’s that his issues may not energize the base in the most important election in this country ’s history
in the us elections are n’t determined by candidate quality they ’re determine by how well the ruling party governs
hmm i wonder who a cryptobro like you would like to see elected
even this debate ’s effects are debated by historians and political scientists it ’s just a fun story in the american mythos so it keeps getting repeated like a hard fact
something only that ’s only accurate once could also be called extremely inaccurate
yeah that 's not true biden picked up a lot of momentum after a big win in south carolina the black vote carries that state so it is always a litmus test for black voters in swing states even if the primary had carried on bernie would have lost decisively after super tuesday
also as long as there 's only one d on the ballot in november why would it matter
for me it was n't about winning or losing biden showed me how unfit he is to be president moving forward no matter who his opponent is or what he has done republicans do n't even need to tell us he 's sleepy senile too old he did that for them last night we all called trump out as being unfit due to his mental capacity joe biden was worse and so we should all be calling him unfit for office as well
i never watch debates the watching of or listening to it is important in this case transcripts wo n't let you fully appreciate how catastrophic it was for biden because while i too prefer to read news rather than watching it this was the most public and most watched moment of the entire campaign as the first presidential debate usually is for both candidates the written transcripts do n't do it justice in order to know what most other people were exposed to which is the relevant political strategic consideration you need to watch or at least listen to it he has a stutter and he had a cold simply do n't suffice as explanations biden proved he is senile his biggest political vulnerability whatever good he 's done as the top executive officer he may have been a good president but he is no longer capable of being a good politician anyone who 's been paying close attention to biden 's off the cuff public remarks over the last few months or year as i have does n't seem to be as surprised as others about this fact although even knowing he 's been exhibiting signs of senility something i do n't wish to be true because i want trump to lose but is true whether i like it or not i was still surprised at how catastrophically bad he was last night to reiterate biden is incapable of being a sufficiently good enough politician to defeat trump in november whatever you think of his record as president defeating trump in november is essential biden must step aside or trump will in all likelihood win being able to speak in public coherently and off the cuff is an essential feature for a good politician that biden no longer has the cope and gaslighting from establishment democrats that boil down to being a good public speaker off the cuff is n't all that important for a politician to win are infuriating and frightening and against common sense from now on all attempts to diminish his apparent senility will come off as gaslighting to anyone who watched the debate and that 's true even of people who will eventually vote for him if we must like myself my vote is locked in for the democrats but i do not represent everyone and it is the millions of other people whose choices will decide the election not my own personal choice to vote for the democrat over the republican every time
lmao you ’re deluded biden beat trump in 2020 and incumbents historically have an advantage they would love for biden to drop out the flood of psy op “ liberal ” accounts calling for him to step down is proof positive of that
yup more like a new world screwworm so evil multiple governments work together trying to eradicate it
he called the shit poop
the 81 year old who can barely form a sentence is the obvious choice for the president and leader of the free world
yes it would still be a pro facious vs pro democracy election again i 'd vote pro democracy
should look at getting that 9 key checked out on the keyboard though
i dodged a bullet not watching the debate at all yesterday i listened to reggaeton on my headphones and watched a movie instead
pshhh of course i have i pass those all the time i passed one just a little bit ago just because i was bored i can pass a test any time i want
not a bot will vote for biden he should drop out after last night most independents and undecideds think he could n’t finish a sentence putting in someone else draws in the “ double haters ” not every comment is an astrotruf stop living in the echo chamber
i think so too some of the comments looked very repetitive from the megathread it may have been a plethora of bots
mine i thought i had to keep
you need 2 3 of the house and a majority in the senate to change the number of seats
seriously we got ta future supreme court justice up there
last night looked like a major health emergency for potus biden may be ok to sit in his rocker but not as potus
still seems likely the trump camp will want another debate closer to the election to “ remind ” voters how bad they think biden will do there ’s already another debate scheduled for september after both party conventions
they discovered demagoguery is n’t recognized because it ’s not taught in public schools an electorate educated in basic civics would not be caught in the democratic death spiral we are in
you 'll vote for anyone with a d against their name switching is actually a good strategy being on the ground after that debate i can tell you biden is not doing fine i hope you accept the upcoming polls
i thought he was losing that ’s why he asked for the debate in the first place
so are biden and harris the best the democrats have to offer or would harris be a better president than biden do you think
i will not vote harris i will vote biden harris is a detestable person
you 'd be talented at the game twister
yeah but the problem is that the american people have also spent 4 years under trump and 4 years under biden and they simply do n't agree with you that 's why biden 's approval rating is has been so low for the vast majority of his presidency your opinion that biden has been a great president is an extreme outlier and probably a reflection of the media echochamber you hang out in
there 's no way any other candidate is winning the election in 4 months there 's nobody else with enough national recognition within the party that can pull in the votes by continuing the narrative that biden should step down you are directly supporting trump that 's why you 're being accused of supporting trump not to mention a good 2 3 of the usernames with these sentiments that i run through redective have strong correlation with right leaning and blatantly right wing subreddits
the practical outcome of withholding your vote for biden is that trump will win it is a super simple straightforward unavoidable thing go ahead and talk about his performance but maybe try to not discourage people from voting
it 's a two party system not supporting biden is functionally equivalent to supporting trump
i ’m convinced anyone else could easily beat trump you are wrong nobody else has the national recognition and support that biden can muster not newsome not whitmer not anyone in congress you are hoping democrats sacrifice a good future candidate that is not going to happen
lmao no they are n’t it ’s who entertains the most they treat politics like a cage match that ’s why trump is so successful
no this is n't the 90s anymore they 're determined by memes on tiktok and facebook now
that ’s not really true because different parties can control different branches of the government
ah yes me a progressive vegan who has been active in left leaning organizations is a checks notes cryptobro i think you 're cooked i want to see anyone other trump elected i also do n't want a walking corpse as the president when we 're suffering attacks to our democracy under the threat of theocratic fascism and the potential of ww3 why are you okay with that ad hominem attacks are also a logical fallacy btw you should really learn to debate the points and not the person who raises them
what does this comment even mean
you can say that about almost anything proving causality is a near impossible task for anything but it 's perfectly serviceable for a counterexample for such a strong unnuanced statement
yes and i could call you shirley what 's your point
so you just wo n't vote because one or the other will win there 's no third choice that appears if you do n't vote sure you 're bothered by biden 's age i 'm sure you were horrified back in 2017 when the last president was wandering around on the tarmac unable to find the limo directly in front of him or bragging how the stealth fighter was invisible like wonder woman 's jet now you think both men are mentally incompetent then it comes down to voting on the issues but maybe your life wo n't change one way or another no matter who wins like you could be someone unaffected by turning back civil rights or gutting social security and other safety nets but perhaps you can see how your indifference might be viewed by people who care about their ability to get health care marry the person they love and ensure financial support for the elderly disabled and poor for them when it comes down to two bad choices they 're going to pick the guy whose staff does n't include stephen miller and steve bannon
that 's silly maybe a little naive possibly disingenuous on your part after all people can put on the very best show or in this case the very worst but it does n't change facts i already know biden is old as fuck i knew that in 2020 too i ca n't stand listening to him talk ever in any context he 's got those weird old man sayings that make me feel like i 'm visiting the nursing home i also know trump is old as fuck and a speed freak i 've heard him talk before first on his show where he 'd sound dumb and make duck faces then as a politician where he 'd go off on meandering stories full of nonsensical shit again i 'm back at the nursing home just this time the old man 's got access to uppers i ca n't believe you think listening to them put on a show would change anything like imagine trump came out and spoke eloquently about his dream for the future of all americans he did n't lie or avoid the question not an ounce of racism in any answer just absolute perfection i still would n't vote for him because i 've read his policy plans so maybe stop being so easily distracted by the lights and cameras and read what these people actually want to do as president
the times editorial board would disagree with you this is n’t some psy op biden needs to bow out if we do n’t want 4 more years of trump
the cognitive decline was clearly there to see
only a bot would ask this
no the 78 year old with no political experience or interest a shit administration based on nepotism already tried to and has plans to dismantle democracy is a failed broke businnesman for sale does n't know how to speak without lying wants to give up the us leadership of the free world is a convicted felon and rapist andd on and on the list goes is definitely a better choice s the 81 year old has a competent team around him and has had an objectively good term anyone with the smallest bit of brain capacity sees right through the orange fool and recognizes the danger he presents to the free world and the us
versus the 78 year old who ca n’t answer a fucking question got it
good then let 's replace biden with someone competent and beat fascism
yeah it clearly did n’t do its job well enough a couple other numbers slipped in there
the tortoise lays on its back its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it ca n't not without your help but you 're not helping
ditto i desperately do not want trump to be president again biden made trumps coronation last night it sickens me
all good tough to tell these days
that ’s false the constitution empowers congress with majority rule over the courts sc appointments are lifelong but the seats and jurisdiction are up to congressional majorities sc size is not in the constitution neither is number of reps in the house btw which also impacts elector allocation so many broken things have a majoritarian solution if only there was the will
this winning is one thing but does anybody think biden is medically fit to have the nuclear button for four more years
dems will when the opponent is trump what about people who are n't dems switching candidates would be moronic and would probably insure a loss
the president has more experience and more clout to get things done
probably a reflection of the media echochamber you hang out in no do n't think so maybe it 's due to the fact that trump was an absolutely terrible president
that ’s just like your opinion man others could easily say you are directly supporting trump by insisting someone incapable should keep running i myself do n’t know what the right answer is to defeating trump biden staying the course or a quick replacement but acting all high and mighty like your perspective is the only valid one does nothing but push people on the same team further apart explain your position defend your reasoning that it ’s not a good idea to replace biden but let ’s pretend like our political theory foresight is solid fact
ah yes me a progressive vegan who saw the absolute disaster in real time last night and felt the same utmost dread that everyone watching live felt somehow i am directly supporting trump and am 2 3 associated with right learning subreddits the absolute hopium on this sub from individuals that wo n't call out biden being a terrible candidate who should never have made it this far is concerning trump will win with this mentality biden should step down i 'm saying the same thing as every major journalist publication who is worried about our democracy
honestly at this point it seems like there is no way biden is winning in 4 months
any other candidate could win biden has 0 support at this point all the votes he 's getting are anti trump votes that would go to any democrat so any other candidate would have nowhere to go but up four months also is n't an incredibly short amount of time many countries have their campaign season shorter than that
no one here is discouraging anyone from voting for biden if that 's what it comes down to
maybe you should try for once to think in strategic political terms rather than issuing individualistic moral condemnations because politics is in part the art of predicting and reacting to what people who are n't like you will do i 'll vote for biden if i must but at the same time if he loses in november it wo n't be the fact that i personally expressed fears about his likelihood of defeating trump to blame if he loses in november it will be because he is incapable of being a good politician anymore as he lacks one of the key features of a good politician the ability to speak coherently and off the cuff he 's been a fine president but is no longer a good politician and those are distinct things maximizing democratic chances of success in november means biden steps aside and we have an open convention that 's how bad the situation has gotten willfully blinding yourself to it pretending that biden 's performance last night was just a fluke of displaying all the symptoms of senility for 90 minutes in the most widely viewed event of the campaign and lashing out like this that does n't help i want democrats to win that 's why i want biden to step aside because if he does n't the likelihood of success in november is low
we want him to step aside so that there is someone to vote for
in my state it wo n't make a difference outright support for biden is a double standard when we all called our trump for being unfit due to mental capacity trump never had a senior moment as bad as biden was last night do n't get me wrong trump is horrendous which is why we need to consider replacing biden with someone with a shred of competency
you can support biden and still say that he should drop out like i can say i 'm going to vote for biden in november if he 's the nominee and at the same time say biden is too old i love him but he needs to step down for the good of our country
proceeding with biden is handing the keys to the wh to trump the senate to mitch and the house to mike i will support any d candidate but let 's be real here
i think you 're both wrong not everyone could beat trump but to think that only biden can beat trump is shortsighted too as a thought experiment consider if we had a tom hanks meg ryan ticket or ryan hanks they can flip a coin they 'd have huge name recognition and public goodwill i 'm not saying they should be our nominees but let 's consider all our options the democratic party does n't have to nominate one of the obvious contenders or even someone with political ambition
politics in the us was never determined by how well the ruling party governs that 's a fantasy a root fantasy of democracy but a fantasy nonetheless the scientific development of propaganda techniques in the early 20th century and the emergence of mass media exacerbated the tendency for surface level appearances and vibes to be primarily determinative of the winners of elections but it was always the biggest factor as it is in most or all democracies to be fair to democracy non democratic societies also usually choose new leaders primarily based on surface level appearances and vibes but in those places the relevant attitudes are based on the perceptions of a much smaller set of people
the neolibs in this sub are simply not interested in admitting that the candidate they have committed to is fucked literally the entire progressive wing of the democratic party has been agitating for biden to step aside this year for 4 years but we kept being gaslit by literally all the other neoliberalism dems who act like biden is the perfect candidate who can do no wrong
he 's apparently got me pegged from my post history not realizing that trump was famously anti crypto and also not realizing that crypto has people from all political leanings interested in it they 're basically ignorant and to make matters worse performing an ad hominem attacks in order to continue denying how awful biden was last night
i mean here ’s a scholarly essay about how most assumptions about the debate are wrong or overinflated it ’s also worth noting that kennedy only won by the slimmest of margins in 1960 the debate was n’t an insane watershed moment or anything like it ’s mythicized now
that 's an awful lot of assumptions why is it impossible to call out the fact that biden is an awful candidate especially based on last night 's performance without people assuming you 're calling for trump or a third party we need a better candidate our allies were watching our enemies were watching it was incredibly embarrassing and saying that neither candidate is acceptable does not mean i 'm advocating for the worse of the two obviously biden is better out of the two but he 's not a good candidate his approval rating is abysmal he 's failing at solving the problems americans have and his mental capacity is deteriorating why are you okay with this is it because he 's not the other guy anyone could fit that criteria
i ca n't believe you think listening to them put on a show would change anything it does n't change anything for me i will still vote for biden if i must it 's not me being distracted by lights and cameras it 's me acknowledging that these spectacles can make a difference to other people even if they usually do n't it was that bad such that an event that does n't usually move the needle certainly will the worst presidential debate performance of all time on biden 's part proving that his biggest political vulnerability his senility is actually true to a massive audience considering how certain things will affect other people even if they do n't affect me is how electoral politics should be understood it will make a difference in the election and lowers the likelihood of biden 's win because biden proved that his biggest political vulnerability is true in the most public way possible during a presidential campaign it changes the calculus such that the risk of loss of changing candidates is lesser than the risk of biden continuing to run i was already aware that biden seemed senile in his off the cuff public appearances over the last few months or year and even i was shocked how catastrophically he performed last night
the ny times is not a great source for left leaning opinions on elections they spent almost all their time in the last three election cycles tearing down the liberal candidates in the 2016 election their articles on hillary 's emails leading up to the election outnumbered all other articles on both her and trump 's polcies combined i mean they are basically the source of the why this is bad for biden meme
this is proving my point oligarchs want biden out corporate media worships trump of course the times wants biden to drop out they know his policies and positions speak for themselves and that he will win again nice try though
but were we involved in 2 active wars when trump was president lol
so there was n’t a single question in the debate he did n’t answer biden did the same dude kept blaming the other guy lol
lol love the downvotes from people that prefer a convenient lie to a hard truth my hope is that the reason biden ’s people pushed this debate to the earliest it ’s ever been was yo handle this except thing and have him graciously step down in a week or so if he came out swinging last night he stays otherwise they start to pivot and look for someone who can secure the “ double haters ” hell maybe biden has someone in mind that sounds insane and it might be but so was last night so fingers crossed we get a couple days of “ no it ’s joe biden ” and he backs out in a week to a week and a half so it does n’t look reactionary to the debate
you need to beat the filibuster
you think the biden we saw the other night is going to win over non dems he already has a terrible approval rating he 's just made himself look incompetent on an international stage
there are no other candidates that can win biden stepping down will be a concession of the election we are in a very precarious position but again democratic voters are going to shoot themselves in the foot there 's no hopium here there 's just delusion from you and people suggesting biden should step down or the dnc should remove him that 's automatic game over
what does you being a vegan have to do with whether biden should step down
nah you ’re just overreacting starting to really lose the forest for the trees biden is n’t stepping aside
there is someone to vote for biden him stepping aside could splinter the party and hand the election to trump it ’s a shortsighted suggestion
i think trump has had similar senior moments on the campaign trail and said even crazier things and constantly lies but that 's not as big a political liability for him because his supporters have lead poisoning soup for brains and additionally trump 's senior moments did n't occur in the most public spectacle of all modern campaign seasons the first presidential debate and more it is widely acknowledged that biden 's age and apparent senility are his biggest political liability which biden not only played into but proved last night to the biggest audience conceivable for the campaign is that unfair to biden yes is it a fact that biden 's senility is a bigger political liability to him than trump 's senility is for trump also yes i do n't understand why it 's so hard for some people to accept to borrow a phrase inconvenient truths they 'd rather willfully blind themselves and stick their fingers in their ears while they 're led to the cliff rather than think strategically about politics for one second i guess
like i ’ve said elsewhere if you guys do n’t fall in line behind biden you will earn yourselves trump and take us all down with you all because you ca n’t see the bigger picture
you 're posting to the international public here not just your state
talk like this just becomes a self fulfilling prophesy if everyone believes he will win then he 'll win
can you show where i accused you of supporting trump or a third party i suggested you would not vote because you said you had already called out trump 's incompetency so why would i think you supported him do n't project onto me what others have said to you please who would be a better nominee newsom a california elite who had separate rules for himself during covid and used to be married to don jr 's coked up girlfriend it would be a week before the entire media establishment made newsom look like an empty suit then these same threads would be full of people sighing dramatically at how the dnc always picks losers if there 's one thing i 've learned since switching parties it 's how the democratic side really loves to shit on their own people mayor pete is a no go and anyone unable to understand why is living in a lovely progressive bubble the same people who do n't want biden also do n't want harris i see whitmer 's name mentioned but most people do n't know who she is and she would n't have much time to win over independents many of them men so who else is there with a few months to go they 'd need to swap out biden rally the ds who again are notorious for jumping on the media bandwagon and shitting on their own people to vote for this new person hope there were no skeletons in that person 's closet and then hope this person would n't be viewed as so scary by boomer genx moderates that they either stayed home or voted r that 's why i feel good about biden should we have old people running the country no i was very disappointed when sanders decided to run again in his state the man had decades to mentor new blood but the silent generation and boomers seem set on dying in office i ca n't change that fact i can only see the reality of the situation and pray enough people care to vote in this election so we can have another one where someone younger than seventy gets elected
oh ok i get it now no point talking to someone like you my bad
which itself is a senate rule that can be eliminated with a simple majority vote
so if it was any other candidate you would n't vote for them you 'll only vote for biden of course not anyone voting for biden now will also vote for another d the issue is that biden needs to turn undecideds which he failed to do
the comment poster i replied to is accusing me of being a right wing far right shill across a number of different comments
there will be one single nominee by the end of the convention in august how could that splinter the vote
if trump is as an existential threat to democracy as everyone claims democrats will come out of the convention rallying behind whoever wins biden is not going to get better his poll numbers are not going to get better americans have been saying for 2 years now that he is too old to run and we 've had our heads in the sand all this time ignoring what the people are saying well now it 's on full display i do n't care about feelings i want us to win and the best chance of winning is biden stepping down
if we fall in line with someone clearly incompetent we will earn ourselves trump not only that we 'll lose the senate and the house
i ca n't believe anyone can feel good about biden after last night to be honest this should be a cake walk for anyone up against a convicted felon but we 're going to quite possibly lose because we 're being told to not believe what we saw last night i do n't want trump in the white house i do n't want the senate and house to swing r with bidens performance last night i think it might happen
there is n’t a point i do n’t personally like either president but i can see your bias and even if i hit you with cold hard facts you ’re not going to change your opinion so there ’s no reason in me trying to convince you it ’s the internet nothing i say will be believed or agreed with since it ’s a political thread and those seem to only bash trump while stating biden is the savior even though he ’s an incompetent 81 year old who does n’t know where he is half the time objectively good term inflation is soaring nobody ’s hiring yet they claim biden created the most jobs out of any presidency even though they were literally bounce back jobs like trump said it ’s the jobs that were lost during covid he did n’t do anything for us except give ukraine hundreds of billions of dollars but right the senile old man who literally stopped talking mid sentence and stared into the distance is definitely the one for us the guy who literally can not form one proper sentence in a 90 minute debate lol
and then the issue becomes someone else has no national recognition to get undecideds to vote for them get real here
okay what does you being a vegan have to do with any of that
because you ’d be pissing off the voters that still support him you ’d make the party look weak and unpredictable to undecided voters who wo n’t feel confident voting for a democrat when the party is so volatile
i do n't care about feelings i want us to win and the best chance of winning is biden stepping down it ’s actually the opposite bringing chaos to the democratic party is n’t going to convince undecided voters to vote dem in november the best chance is with the incumbent
this is a simple concept what 's confusing you
oh is this guy maga looking back over the comments i should have at least sensed he was a both sides type of person instead i assumed he was simply young and naive thanks for the heads up
i wrote an essay above explaining why i feel good about biden i can support the old guy and his solid administration who 's directly helped people i know support a psycho or feel defeated and not vote since you did n't mention someone you thought could step in now and whip up enthusiasm on the d side i sense you just feel defeated that 's fine but i just ca n't give into that narrative if trump wins it 'll be because people did n't care enough to stop him my vote wo n't make a difference indiana for president but i 'm still going to stand in line and vote for anyone with a d next to their name if they all lose at least i 'll know i did n't sit it out and hope other people showed up
none of this meaningless whining about “ cold hard facts “ changes the actual fact that only one of these candidates is a convicted fucking felon and fraud with upcoming criminal trials for totally unimportant stuff like hiding the top secret documents he stole in a mar a lago bathroom the “ cold hard fact ” that trump literally promised to be “ dictator for a day ” and doubled down on that statement in his next term also seems pretty significant no comment right he was joking right nothing else you try to spew about “ facts ” while ironically ignoring actual facts about job numbers can cover up the things trump has done but it is hilarious watching you repeat the convicted fraud ’s talking points without a second thought
you want to get real if the party replaced biden with someone else there would be a media frenzy even someone we 've never heard of would have national name recognition in a matter of days we are not talking about an unknown trying to start a primary campaign struggling to put together funding and a media team we 're talking about a presidential nominee with the resources of the party behind them we 're talking about a presidential race where many americans were discouraged to see the same matchup we had in 2020 toss someone new into that mix and they 're not going to have trouble getting noticed
yes that is a much better situation than what biden gave us last night that is the entire concern that everyone saying biden needs to step down is considering you 're finally understanding the problem you just think his performance was acceptable when nearly every journalistic publication and every silent d politician does not
many undecided are only undecided because of how bad biden is as a candidate removing him would be an automatic massive vote increase
so you may not know this but veganism is associated with left wing ideological leaning so to be accused of right wing ideological leaning is a preposterous assumption that makes little sense to the fact that biden is an unacceptable candidate so you could ask the op what does posting on a crypto subreddit have to do with any of that instead because you agree with them you 're asking me that question instead why are you not asking them
if everyone believes he will win he will win
wo n’t say what they stand for wo n’t say who they ’re voting for talks shit about biden and his cognitive decline ’ definitely a boot licker
you did write an essay i dunno how you can sense defeat because i did n't read the all of text though we should expect more from our political leaders than what we saw last night it 's clear you do n't expect more but also do n't think there 's anyone better despite 60 % of american 's wanting a better candidate anyone voting for joe biden will vote for another person with d next to their name you just confirmed this so honestly anyone who can speak and think a full sentence with a d next to their name will have at least bidens support ergo anyone would be an improvement given his abysmal ratings i sense you are now defeated
we can play this game all day but when he was n’t shown the door by the gop after disparaging pows that was when it became clear that something was going terribly wrong
trump should have been arrested on jan 7 and still be sitting in a cell awaiting his prosecution
he should have been prosecuted for treason between j6 and the documents at mal what the fuck is he doing running for pres again
making fun of the handicapped reporter should have been the end of it
cnn really said what if we gave a malignant narcissist unfiltered access to millions of voters and did absolutely nothing to fact check him they gave him basically free promo the first time and they re doing it again
exactly once the 34 felony convictions were handed down biden should have issued a statement that he will not be debating a felon to allow a convicted felon on the stage with the president elevates the felon for no reason
trump used the ol baffle m with bullshit he said so many lies biden spent more time call him on his shit then moving forward with what biden plans to do
convicted felon trump should never have had the stage last night
you know what whatever some things can not be stopped i guess this was biden 's biggest chance to literally finish him after all the stuff his campaign has been doing and he literally flushed it all away all many people will remember is this debate performance the thing is if your country goes down the drain a whole lot of things do so yeah the world is up for some real upheaval in the coming years win or lose this thing you are having in the us is far from over this looks like the back story of a sci fi movie what an awful time to be alive
i agree but it happened we need to take a deeper look at how this happened and i 'll give you a clue the republican party begat joseph mccarthy richard nixon barry goldwater roy cohn lee atwater and j edgar hoover they in turn begat richard nixon as president who then begat william rehnquist and lewis powell nixon set the table along with gerald ford for ronald reagan ronald reagan then appointed sandra day o'connor antonin scalia anthony kennedy to the court and elevated rehnquist to the chief justiceship he attempted to appoint robert bork to the supreme court after bork as solicitor general did nixon 's bidding and fired watergate prosecutor archibald cox reagan also chose george h w bush as his vice president who then succeeded him as president bush then appointed david souter and clarence thomas to the court bush in turn begat george w bush and jeb bush jeb bush then pardoned katherine harris and appointed her florida secretary of state harris was responsible for the florida central voter file scandal disenfranchising an estimated 60 000 legitimate florida voters this may and probably resulted in the florida 2000 presidential vote mess the reagan and george h w bush appoointees to the court then snatched bush vs gore away from the florida supreme court turned the 14th amendment on its head and chose george w bush as president by judicial fiat ignoring the 9th 10th and 12th amendments as well as the 14th amendment in the process george w bush then begat samuel alito and john roberts as supreme court justices mitch mcconnell partially begat by ronald reagan illegally refused to accept barach obama 's supreme court nominee nominated due to the untimely death of justice antonin scalia and held that seat open for donald trump who appointed neill gorsuch brett kavanaugh and as a lame duck appointment amy coney barrett to the court this has been a 50 to 60 year project by the republican party also see the powell letter or powell manifesto and in the process they created a frankenstein 's monster named donald trump although ronald reagan was also a creation as was george w bush all three presidents may have finished the united states of america
i agree but biden ’s team was the one who challenged him to a debate they were behind in the polls and thought they could get ahead it backfired so high risk moderate reward hard to say hindsight is always 20 20 but if they could go back in time i ’m sure they would n’t have proposed the debate that all being said i think he can rebound he has to find his voice though this wispy gravely voice he ’s been using is hurting him he also needs to slow down when he speaks that was a big part of his problem last night he was trying to get a lot out he did n’t need to it also does him no favors to have jill walk out there like she ’s his caretaker he can come back but he ’ll have to work twice as hard as he would have if he had n’t bombed that debate i do n’t think last night changed anyone ’s vote it might have convinced some people to stay home though that ’s an issue for down ticket candidates
the real tragedy of this debate is the total failure of the system in normalizing a candidate that could n't answer a single debate question to save his life the fact that we 're even discussing biden being old as opposed to tubz blustering and bullshitting his way through this debate not to mention his entire life is pathetic i 'd vote for a dead skunk before considering voting for the orange clown
this article should have been written in 2014
he never should ’ve been allowed into politics in the first place
he had the platform and broadcasted pure lies from it
this is what happens when you do n't make an example out of domestic terrorists
i just wish there was someone who could rub trumps nose in every one of his lies so hard they ’d change his name from trump to dirty sanchez
yep cnn screwed the entire country by mis managing the debate they just let a known con man and liar spew lies non stop to a nationwide audience with zero fact checking
the msm including cnn platformed him in 2016 let us not forget
he demanded death sentences for the central park 5 in the 80s during the cold war he questioned our foreign policy after a trip to the ussr and he bankrupted casinos need i say more
yeah and half the country should n't be voting for someone who makes no secret of his disdain for representative government but we live in the dumbest timeline so everyone needs to start reading books and investing in public education
the debate was a travesty because its whole premise was to treat a failed coup leader as a legitimate candidate for the presidency exactly he was a failed coup leader he should have been arrested on january 7th
dems should have put up a candidate that could easily thwart trump on this platform should have been a dunk let ’s stop making excuses
biden would 've looked even worse if republicans actually chose a reasonable candidate
lie lie lie that is literally all he does
remember when the usa had morals and common sense
why he lied and lied and lied just more evidence but his golf game is good
no biden 's team should have known better than to put him on that stage biden is awful without a teleprompter anyone thinking biden debated well has the wool pulled over their eyes
if only there was somebody on stage last night to oppose trump
he should be in jail amd biden should be in a nursing home
cnn is selling out our country in exchange for views
cnn letting trump just go up there spewing lies and filth and leaving it up to biden to be the one feeble bastion of sanity which the whole county is dependant on
trump is the only person in the history of the us who has been impeached and is a convicted felon
everyone is mad about last night and everyone is looking for someone to blame but the only reason we ’ll ever get more trump is if we do n’t vote trump could roll around in shit and foam at the mouth and he would n’t lose a single vote we ca n’t let one bad debate keep us from doing the same project 2025 is very real vote
and yet the media will do everything they can to give trump screentime
imagine not promoting debate what if republicans did the same crazy fks
that ’s the real story how is this fuck being allowed to run for president in the first place
lol at these takes guys it 's all on biden he 's the one who promised us he had this he said watch me well we believed him and we watched him and we 've seen enough i want to win this year not lose we need a new candidate
trump should be in jail he should have been arrested on j7 and remained in custody until his appearance before a judge for the insurrection he is a danger to the public and the world
1 bad biden debate drop out 34 felonies cheating on his taxes trying to overthrow democracy for trump everything is fine media is getting what it wants
he absolutely should have and it gave us a glimpse into the reality of the situation we all needed this be honest with yourselves
healthcare supreme court womens rights ukraine other world leaders views of biden no question in my mind at all i and everyone i know will vote for biden rather than the orange dog dirt who was once president
networks tripping over themselves to give convicted felon and traitor a platform to spew unconscionable lies for millions from every angle it ’s corporations competing fuck the american people in the name of money
exactly the media is treating trump like he 's a regular candidate and he 's not i refused to watch the debate because i wo n't treat trump as such and will not give him any of my time
here ’s the sitch maga has a very clear message deport deregulate dismantle revenge what exactly is our message not trump not trump not trump we ’ll soon find out of that can win again in 2024
i mean i found the debate pretty enlightening
the real debate is biden 's performance v trump 's disaster mr biden had his facts and had done his homework the debate went quite well mr trump made all sorts of denials mr biden made good points the raspy presentation is a small thing mr biden made good points
if i went back 20 years and told someone trump and biden are the 2 presidential candidates for 2024 they ’d throw me in an insane asylum
i just do n't understand how people from bidens camp ever thought something positive would come of this debate for them it was a fucking disaster
it ’s interesting people keep going after the moderators for not fact checking trump it ’s like admitting biden needs a tag team to debate
any yet the media wo n’t quit putting him up any chance they get
was n’t it biden ’s campaign team ’s idea to do this shitty debate anyway talk about arrogance
headlines should never state the fucking obvious fucking shit heads
biden 's team wanted it blame them
that ’s true but it ’s no excuse for biden ’s poor performance trump has done so much shit and almost none of it got brought up by biden
as if yet another news cycle where all networks cover everything he does and everything he says matters and yet here the atlantic is platforming the fuckin guy writing on op ed littered with direct quotes and retelling of the debate the very next day is also not helping you know what i want to read admit that biden had a couple of senior moments then move on to the other 95 % of the things he said that were factual and substantive the platform is not the problem the guy is the gop nominee stop bitching about it encourage your readers to organize and vote
and he would n’t except half of america appears to think this is all awesome i ca n’t understand how that ’s possible but i know it ai n’t cnn ’s fault
i was one of so many appalled by this democrats are asking biden to step down what is wrong with us republicans are allowing this man to try to disgrace the office again and were whining about biden
neither of them should have had that opportunity
only the biden campaign to blame for that honestly they asked for this
that ’s not how free speech works i think he ’s a shit candidate for president but he ’s the republican nominee so he gets to debate the sitting president do n’t like him do n’t vote for him i know i ’m not voting for either one of these shit birds
biden falls apart in the most public manner possible and ' the atlantic ' shouts that trump should never have been platformed in the first place it was a debate for fucks sake not a televised trump rally someone needs to remind them of this headline the next time they whine because they are n't being taken seriously or trusted as much as they believe they should
nah by all accounts trump hurt himself more than any opponent could have he came across as the dementia addled psychopathic criminal he is i was kinda shocked today to read from so many people noticing that who normally do n't comment on politics
lol all this cope in the comments all biden had to do was not look senile did n’t go very well
so much copium enjoy president donnie boy again lmao
biden and his team asked for this debate with these rules blame them if you do n't like it
the democrats gave it to him so it ’s all their fault
if you can convince the lowest white man he 's better than the best colored man he wo n't notice you 're picking his pocket hell give him somebody to look down on and he 'll empty his pockets for you lyndon b johnson
if you vote for trump you ’re a jackbooted nazi thug he tried to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power you do n’t deserve to vote you do n’t deserve to live in a democracy go live in a north korean prison or putin ’s gulag you have no self respect you swine
it was stupid beyond measure for biden to agree to this any gains in the polls he may have gotten because of trump 's convictions are now lost what an absolute idiot he and his team are
the fact the he is even allowed on the balllot speaks volumes
yall are insane and he ’s the threat to democracy lol get lost
second time cnn gave this asshole a platform when he should n’t have had one
how about democrats should n't have shoved biden down our throats during the primary or what little bit of it they allowed to happen when he obviously is too senile to perform well in a debate just loving all this media spin today trying to deflect from the disaster reality of biden
the atlantic is all over the map today
all of this has been a disaster built brick by brick and we all got to watch it happen and ask why the government is letting this happen and why his party is allowing this to happen and then you had the other disaster lurking behind the scenes that time had finally caught up with biden but the political apparatus that protects incumbents risked that he would be healthy all the way through to november 2024 when it was obviously not the case
let me say the opposite of what i am doing by publishing this smooth move
all trump has ever deserved is a coat hanger
blame the dnc approach of spending millions boosting the shittiest gop candidates because it supposedly ensures they 're up against the most beatable opponents also known as the pied piper strategy
out fucking rageous that we are where we are our leaders allowed this to happen and that pisses me the fuck off
while i agree in premise these are the only opportunities to take trump down in person and make the shit he has done stick to him in front of a huge audience i do n't think this article would have been written if biden gave his 2020 first debate performance and even if biden was awful trump still managed to alienate practically anyone that already is n't apart of the maga cult
media power brokers want this
debate is never a bad thing
if biden had performed you would n’t be saying this i think this is the most truthful thing i ’ve seen in politics in quite some time you can develop your own opinions without every news outlet weighing in you ca n’t unsee what everyone else saw i like that it was civil maybe too tightly controlled but definitely a break from what we ’ve seen in the past
it ’s old men not giving up power that ’s a problem in america it ’s not serving our needs as a society
what was even the point of these two debating they 've both been president we know what they did when they held the office which more than anything they can say during a debate will point to what they 'll do if they win the next election
i mean it made both of them look horrible it 's concerning biden could n't even put up a fight to someone as pathetic as trump
the supreme court refused to uphold the constitution he should n’t even be allowed to run the coup is ongoing and continues and the sc traitors who decided the colorado case are part of it
he should have had a real opponent
“ i really really wish i could ignore my lying eyes ” the media and the democrats should n’t have gaslit us for three years pretending this guy was at the wheel the reality you are waking up to is democrats lied to you for years and we ’re so fucking arrogant they thought they could stick a fucking corpse in the oval office
bidens camp made the choice suck it up buttercup i loved the cnn melt down after the debate not even they could hide that decbol
he 's the former president and the nominee of a party that will get tens of millions of votes this november you do n't get to decide if he has a platform or not
this is the most biased title ever kkk people have platforms terrorists have platforms now trump ai nt them but trying to deplatform people just makes people support them more let trump debate and then see if the people like him or not
no he ’s a presidential candidate and he deserves to speak even if it ’s nonsense dem establishment played itself with no crowd and not letting rfk who deserves to be there too it ’s the facts not saying i agree with him so we would n’t focus on how bad both guys are
that fact that you can run for president after being criminally charged as well as guilty of defrauding banks is beside me what ’s wrong with this planet
they offered him the debate all trump did was agree he walked in watch biden destroy himself and left about as difficult as ordering in person at a fast food restaurant something we know trump is great at
the only candidate capable of beating trump according to that candidate 's team proposed the platform and the rules for it great judgment
another banger from the same people who brought you it is possible to kill children legally
you could easily blame the democratic party for this because they do n’t have a strong leadership program and because they are so divided they have n’t had a chance to build a strong leader for the party who could just beat down trump instead they decided to go with one of the worst options ever in joe biden
i was hoping for a change in politics and got him
shoulda coulda woulda too late for that shit hilary could ’ve let bernie stomp him out in 2016 but pussy prevailed
trump deserves a platform perhaps he would consider the one his followers erected during his coup attempt in front of the capitol
christ the whining about he lied or he should n't have been there is so infantile he did he was and it does n't matter he is who is on the ballot come november
he gave home field advantage to biden and still made him look like a fool you really ca n’t make this off copium overdose
watching trump yesterday was like watching usyk beat the daylight out of tyson
biden won the debate you dullard
anyone got a tally of how many felons were held accountable for their action s
these takes in this thread are so off base so what trump lied a lot it 's a freaking debate y' all when he lies it is joe biden 's job to call him a liar and counter his points intelligently and tactfully that 's how a debate works and to say trump should n't be given that platform is crazy like him or not this guy is leading the polls he deserves to debate on that basis you do n't get to arbitrarily say someone does n't get to debate just because you do n't like him being a convicted felon does n't bar him from running for president so citing that does n't make any sense either also biden 's team are the ones that offered to debate him in the first place
whoever decided that it was a good idea for biden to decide that he should debate trump clearly underestimated the fact that it is impossible to debate with a liar even if the moderators had done their job and called out as many of trump ’s lies possible there did n’t appear to be time to call out all of them he still appeared to be more confident in an event that places heavy emphasis on performance biden has strong administrative skills less so with debating skills also it can be truly shocking and difficult to figure out how to respond in the presence of such brazen lies even when you ’re expecting it and i ’m speaking from personal experience
it 's a good thing he got it though at least the american people got to see the stark contrast in cognitive ability between the two very impressive night for trump
this is a well written and organized essay the language is plain and references familiar concepts the usage flows easily from one sentence and paragraph to the next moreover the meaning behind the words bears truth to the thesis ' relevance in our present moment great article
you should not have this platform
biden called out trump he opened to door to put both candidates on a platform and had some big talk about beating the man joe needed to show strength and had every opportunity to do so cnn a moderately left news network with tapper an adamantly anti trumper allowed a form for open discussion and reminded both candidates of questions asked when they diverted to take shots biden failed pathetically and there is n’t a spin to change that the people behind him should be charged with elder abuse coming up with “ he had a cold ” at the 11th hour was a joke as a republican i ’d be happy to vote for another candidate but i wo n’t vote for joe because he ’s weak and now everyone including our enemies know it
or mocking a disabled reporter or raping a women or grifting
disparaging pows veterans is a bad look but an actual coup attempt should be a bridge too far for everyone the fact that it ’s not tells you just how much trouble we ’re in
he should never be able to run again until he accepts biden ’s win in 2020 i liked it when biden called him a whiner to his face finally
yeah shoulda coulda woulda ca n’t put the felonious rapist back in the bag
other things the gop conveniently ignore he defrauded charities multiple times cheated on his wife with an ex porn star with a newborn at home has designs on dismantling democracy and installing himself as a strong man is a convicted felon walks all over the rights of minorities and the disadvantaged believes that he is superior because of his genetics hires incompetent and racist people is surrounded by a team that is indicted or in jail wants to pull out of nato supports russia ’s expansionist goals diminishes and disregards science is against federal agencies especially those for environmental and public safety steals top secret documents hires family members because they are family members is a climate change denier uses nazi phrases like calling liberals “ vermin ” or that immigrants are “ poisoning the blood of our country ” is committed to cutting taxes for the threatens to kill his political enemies is staunchly against education and student debt relief has a ridiculous track record insulting veterans is a public health menace throws paper towels at people trying to recover from a hurricane lies constantly about everything has a stupid middle age crisis hair transplant what am i missing edit “ ex pornstar ”
i still think dunking on mccain like that was the x factor that lost him arizona california transplants had trended the state purple and was likely reason 1 but turning off the arizona repubs that had highly respected mccain was a bad leak its a bad leak that bled into the lake defeat when she outright told them to get out now that we 're six years after his death i would believe that its not a leak that 's relevant anymore but i still think its just absurd how hard that angle was pushed it just seemed like such a losing proposition
was that before or after when the russians were paying out bounties on american soldiers and trump did n’t even mention it when he met with putin didnt even mention it
“ fake news ” we do n’t want to silence someone because we disagree with what they say
it 's all obamas fault if he would have just kept his mouth shut at the whitehouse correspondence dinner we would n't have trump thanks obama
i still remember this being the moment i realized there was something different going on with trump 's support of all the shitty things trump has said and done i remember thinking at the time that mocking a veteran not just any veteran but a well respected gop senator for having been a pow would be a bridge too far for gop voters instead his support from gop voters only grew in the days and weeks after i did n't know what to make of it but knew even then it meant nothing good
if you compare biden 's speeches before and post debate speech to his actual debate they somehow doped him up with something maybe in the water i mean he 's never looked or sounded like that before just watch the videos and compare
merrick garland waiting around for like 20 months to appoint jack smith was a critical plot point that led to us facing a potential disaster lous sequence
he 's definitely gotten away with felonies since at least the 70 's he should be a registered sex offender and have done time for at least one of his dozens of rapes there 's so many instances of him getting away with serious crimes just because he was born rich by 2016 he should have had 3 strikes as a felon if he was a normal person who did these things
but if they could put trump in a cell then they could put ' you ' in a cell the audience he 's addressing as you being billionaires and powerful politicians who abuse their power and break laws trump has flagrantly abused the loopholes set up in the system by billionaires and politicians to favor billionaires and politicians the billionaires and politicians who hate trump many in the republican party therefore not only do not oppose trump but support him
thank garland for that ineffective and incompetent
after the search of mar a lago and all those classified and national security documents were found trump should have been detained until trial
the people who invaded the capitol on january 6th were there at trump 's behest and were his storm troopers as were hitler 's sa mussolini 's fasci di combatimetto and franco 's falange
exactly biden had a cold yesterday which is why he appeared cognitively impaired if biden did n't have a cold he would have wiped the floor with trump we got unlucky
he should have at least been questioned immediately also who was ever held responsible for the erased communications of the secret service on jan 6th
in the meantime after jan 6th he moved a few boxes to florida containing national defense secrets what the actual f
i imagine a more poetic imagery on the capitol steps
yeah fuck the constitution put him in a cell for 60 years waiting on prosecution
i predict supreme court is going to give the presidency to trump no matter what happens there 's an uprising coming i do n't know if america is up to it we might just let it happen to us it makes me so freaking sad and angry
treason has a specific meaning delineated in the us constitution “ treason against the united states shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or on confession in open court ” what trump did was n’t treason if you want to call it insurrection an attempted coup theft of top secret documents reckless illegality shockingly negligent or just about any other descriptor i ’m all on board but it was n’t treason in a perfect world trump would have been in prison since the 70 ’s in a less than perfect but much better world he would have been strung up on jan 7 for trying to end our democracy in the world we have i will take any significant consequences at all he has done many things which ought to be utterly disqualifying for holding the presidency but the single most damning and unforgivable thing he ever did was trying to end our democracy the fact that so many americans refuse to see that is a disgraceful indictment of our society edit i ’m getting a lot of comments that posit russia as an enemy of the state or one of the failed states infested with terrorists or whatever none of those meet the definitions required to be treason
being convicted of treason does n’t disqualify you from president only impeachment can do that
or trump repeating the phrase black jobs
you think many voters remember this now let alone in november lol
what 's funny is that so many people are still too stupid to see that this is what cnn wanted they 're fox news lite they 100 % want trump to win not only because they are now owned by a right wing billionaire but because trump is way better for their ratings
the point of a televised debate is n't substance it 's performance
easy to say in retrospect just as easy to say “ what a no brainer debate the guy and just keep reiterating that he ’s a convicted felon with another 60 felony counts pending ” but biden could n’t handle that
cancelling the debate would ’ve been used against him too the problem was whoever helped him prep was an idiot should be fired because biden was n’t ready everyone and their mom knew trump was going to come out the gate trying to confuse him and get him railed up which he did and somehow the biden camp just assumed trump was n’t
and trump standing next to an empty podium or if it was cancelled cause biden did n't come and he went onn fox or somewhere else debated rfk would be better
what a ridiculous statement when trump is a former president you act like he ’s just some random felon off the street
the problem when you stoop to the level of a mudslinger you both end up covered in mud
firehose of falsehoods or as steve bannon put it flood the zone with shit it 's a tried and true fascist tactic for a reason it 's quite effective
the thing is you ca n't ignore all his lies cause it lends legitimacy to them if trump keeps claiming biden favors post birth abortion biden ca n't just nod your head and move on to the next question you have to be able to quickly shut down the lies and then move on to your point the good news is that trump kept repeating the same half dozen lies over and over you can memorize his lies and have a team come up with the most effective response to each one
preserve democracy by preventing the opponent from running
this reminds me of how the niners were winning in halftime
quite a comment well said
i agree with the redditor who said that once trump was convicted biden should have withdrawn so as not to elevate a felon to the platform
this keeps being said but both camps including bidens agreed to these rules the two were supposed to fact check each other you blame cnn all you want but biden agreed to cnns rules
this is such nonsense the debate itself was actually one of the best managed debates in a long time thanks to the new rules cnn did nothing wrong here and actually pressed trump more than once the fault here resides with biden and him alone first for agreeing to the debate and second for completely shutting the bed
this is the second time cnn has done this with trump the first time was with caitylyn collins and his town hall who also failed to correct his lies and gave him a platform to spout his bs the problem i see is that cnn made a shit ton of money when trump was pres so why would they not want to do that again
exactly why did n't he get arrested then
i was thinking what would this look like if vivek was debating on the republican side the polls would probably be 55 % vivek the next day
we still do we choose biden resoundingly and the margin will be even wider this november
if you really want to know give the constitution a read
took the words out of my mouth the blame shifting and denying reality is insane biden had a terrible performance and it was biden 's fault i 'm sitting here reading comment of people blaming the american people for why biden did n't do well as if them expecting the potus to be able to put together a coherent train of thought is a step too far dem 's are n't going to win this election by denying reality and shifting blame like this thread is trying to do blaming cnn is n't going to change the fact that biden looked like a dementia patient in front of the whole world
he also told people he was a transition candidate and then continued running for a second term really shitty
yeah he went one on one and got absolutely embarrassed and yes i know then content of what he said was incredibly superior to the nonsense trump said but a nationally televised debate is 100 % about vibe and trump decimated biden he looked like he always does and spoke clearly and delivered his typical rhetoric biden made so few national tv appearances that i think a lot of people were shocked how small and frail he was he had dead eyes and he spoke like a text to speech program from 2005 it was a huge gamble and he lost
out of curiosity do you understand what those 34 felonies were for because it ’s the stupidest shit ever lol
he 's an insurrectionist a felon a fraud a sexual predator and a likely traitor so no
i learned that all democrats want post birth abortion a fact that i did n't know before
the raspy presentation is a small thing lmao the whole world saw biden 's performance as an embarassment lying to yourself does n't make it so
biden was an important senator as part of the judiciary committee and former primary candidate in 1994 would n't be that shocking
or maybe it should n't be allowed to have a person spewing lies to a nationwide audience in a presidential debate there should be fact checking for both parties this is n't tiktok
they are when it suits their purposes we need to stop the threat to democracy by preventing democracy
” these negroes they 're getting pretty uppity these days and that 's a problem for us since they 've got something now they never had before the political pull to back up their uppityness now we 've got to do something about this we 've got to give them a little something just enough to quiet them down not enough to make a difference ” per doris kearns goodwin what lbj said prior to the passage of the 1957 civil rights act ” as long as you are black and you ’re gon na be black till the day you die no one ’s gon na call you by your goddamn name so no matter what you are called n you just let it roll off your back like water and you ’ll make it just pretend you ’re a goddamn piece of furniture per robert caro what lbj said to his adult chauffeur when he indicated he ’d rather be called by his name than “ boy ” “ chief ” or “ n ” “ son when i appoint a n to the bench i want everyone to know he 's a n ” per robert dallek lbj ’s comment regarding the nomination of thurgood marshall “ we ’ll have these n voting democratic for the next 200 years ” disputed comment by lbj regarding the 1964 civil rights act
because he is a convicted felon on trial for multiple additional felonies a dishonest grifter holds no real platform on which to run owes literally millions in civil penalties attempted to blackmail foreign countries for personal political gain stole thousands of classified documents from the federal government led an insurrection against the state is a civially convicted rapist is a racist who led and encourages white supremacist groups must i go on
because the former president attempted a coup and should be considered an enemy of the state it would be like lincoln debating jefferson davis it 's absurd as it legitimizes the enemy and turns them into not an enemy of course that 's the route biden chose when he assumed power and chose not to hold trump accountable for the coup so biden really only has himself to blame here
you 're right a former president and elected official should have a platform the issue is that trump has become something else as an icon and leader he has influenced the people in a manner that affects them on a negative level his methods enable a form of right wing extremism while using fear mongering just think for a moment why he was he so obsessed about using the border against biden despite what he was saying it was either untrue or vastly exaggerated this is fear mongering at its most classic form this is not what any politician elected official now or in the past should use as a platform we have seen it though it 's not much different from the red scares of the past
yeah this ai n't it trump should never have been on that stage because he 's not fit for the presidency but the stage absolutely needs to exist
yeah no amount of prep was going to make biden better without a teleprompter to lean on time and time again they 've seen how bad biden is off the cuff halfway through walking away from press conferences
it 's called democracy republicans had the opportunity to vote against him in the primaries and they did n't
why criminals being able to take part in democratic processes is just as important as the democratic rights of any other demographic fuck trump but felons should n't be disenfranchised
imagine for one moment styling yourself as the hero of democracy then just after this you say a guy is not eligible to have a platform and basically debate because this is not how democracies works what is next not getting vaccinated is anti democratic these people have no idea what freedom and democracy is like
trump lied blamed ignored the questions and blamed all his failures on president biden and you think it ’s the latter who destroyed himself both president barack obama and john fetterman blew their first debates how did that work out for them
that ’s ludicrous biden won 2020 because people voted against trump not for biden i ’m sure you would tell the jews to focus on self improvement and not worry about that hitler guy
boy howdy you bots are having a field day with this shit
more like jake paul beating up mike tyson
that ’s certainly a new one
this is the best comment on the thread 100 %
what did you like most about his performance his constant and blatant lying it his taking credit for president biden ’s accomplishments and success while projecting his own failures and screwups on president biden
you must be easily impressed it was a non stop shouting firehose of lies
you bots are n’t even trying to hide anymore
cnn a moderately left news network fucking lawl
i still think he 's hard what other head of state has a ' 67 corvette maybe a couple of authoritarian ones across the globe actually
or helsinki russia was straight up organizing and promoting political rallies on american soil
no stop i see your point but it detracts from the reality being pointed out the way he went after mccain should 've been rephrensible to the whole gop on principle alone and yet somehow it was n't it was like trump just steamrolled right over his honorable service and mocked his years of captivity he was unabashed and downright gleeful and republicans lapped it up
to be fair they are afraid of the next grifter who ’s better at the grift and so on
the gop in the senate had one job after j6
agreed on whiner but too little too late biden got the idea out there but was weak on the punchline
trump himself has said that whining is one of his negotiation strategies he whines until he wins while others may think whining is not a positive trait trump thinks otherwise
hilary never accepted trumps win in 2016 this is how politicians are sadly
lawyer here add to your list that he does n't know or understand the laws that his own supreme court overturned his comments about roe v wade were unbelievable he demonstrated a complete lack of familiarity with the legal opinion and subsequent case law and hallucinated a liberal agenda boogeyman to attack instead if he knew anything about it he 'd realize that the things he said in his argument were supported by the case law already before his supreme court overturned it
she was n't a pornstar anymore she changed careers to escort so technically he did n't have sex with a professional pornstar grab em by the pussy just made the deplorables more excited
damn this looks like every headline on cnn and msnbc over the last 2 years wtf lol there is no evidence to 95 % of this shit dude except yes he slept with someone however every sitting president has as well
everyone knows who trump is at this point he said nothing new at the debate nobody ’s opinion of trump or his capacity to lead changed yesterday let ’s put blame where it needs to be and admit that biden ’s the one who should n’t have been given a platform biden is the one who was hurt because people saw what he ’s like trying to look and sound coherent for an hour and a half he can not do it it ’s time for the media to stop covering for him and demand he resign immediately so someone lucid can run the country
now look at republicans in arizona the mccain days are over
it was n't even really waiting to appoint smith that was largely a reaction to trump announcing his campaign while investigations were already underway smith just happened to be a no nonsense prosecutor who moved quickly garland in general a washington post investigation found that more than a year would pass before prosecutors and fbi agents jointly embarked on a formal probe of actions directed from the white house to try to steal the election even then the fbi stopped short of identifying the former president as a focus of that investigation a wariness about appearing partisan institutional caution and clashes over how much evidence was sufficient to investigate the actions of trump and those around him all contributed to the slow pace garland and the deputy attorney general lisa monaco charted a cautious course aimed at restoring public trust in the department while some prosecutors below them chafed feeling top officials were shying away from looking at evidence of potential crimes by trump and those close to him the post found
wray should n't get a pass he slow walked just as much or more
hoping after biden wins he ’ll appoint someone else in garlands place garland needs to go
that would be if his intent was to enforce rule of law if his intent was to avoid any personal risk or to enable trump why then he did exactly what was required of him
i heard biden gave a great speech in nc today debating is n't easy being 81 having a cold and debating a chronic liar is especially difficult
the cold was n’t his issue his issue is brain damage wake up and live in reality not a leftist echo chamber
mate peak copium is this going to be the official line if a cold can so diminish the guy he is nt fit for the big job in any case it is now unavoidable that biden has to go he ca nt beat donald putting your head in the sand does not change the facts of what just happened
yea my 91 year old grandma got cold these couple of years that 's why she ca n't speak whole sentences and forgets everything
you know that excuse was bullshit right if he was really hyped up on cold medicine he might have performed better
really enjoying reading all the mental gymnastics on reddit after biden got exposed lost it at he must have had a cold it was all bad luck lol
oh you ’re serious what a horrible excuse so if shit were to go down our president would n’t be able to handle the pressure if he had a cold and would be cognitively impaired yikes
i ’m going to believe you say this sarcastically lol
that is not a valid excuse biden has always bent over backwards to avoid offending people and almost apologizes for being senator and president and his record shows that he has no fire in the belly we need another franklin or theodore roosevelt
stop lying to yourself lmao
quite frankly he may have committed treason with those documents on top of the crimes of keeping them in the first place or the secret no notes meeting with putin he easily could have given enemies aid and comfort or adhered to them whatever the fuck that means if it meant a buck or made his peepee feel big you know he did it
he colluded treaosnously with russia to win the electoral college in 2016 if it waddles quacks and rapes like a mallard
impeachment and conviction mcconnell and the republican senate were a sympathetic jury
what a wonderful constitution we have that allows a traitor to be president if they have political support truly a text % 22the%20constitution%20is%20not%20a the%20state%20and%20its%20people
by that logic so should the poor kids are as smart as white kids comment
why the hell is it bad do black people find it bad outside of reddit of course
both biden and trump repeated that phrase because it was part of the moderator question it did sound odd but they were all saying it
is “ black ” derogatory to you or something
“ if you ca n’t tell whether you ’re for me or trump then you ai n’t black ”
valid point the average voter has the attention span of a three year old lol
they were primed and ready with the biden attack panel after with very little discussion about trump 's insane lies
the debate format did biden no favours allowing trump to go wildly off topic with his constant lies had joe flailing to address the lies and the actual topic at the same time it is on the democrats for not being prepared for that but also on cnn for the godawful moderation
it was widely reported that biden was heavily prepped for this and had been for weeks i do n't think it 's a lack of preparation or bad management it 's just that there is a limit of what you can ask or expect of people past a certain age there 's sometimes confusion slower reactions and some loss of self confidence at that point despite good health also trump must be hard to prep against because he is so willing to lie and make stuff up on the spot that it broadens the parameters a lot you have to waste time considering all sorts of wild hypotheticals well outside the bounds of reality that ca n't be easy
yeah it ’s everyone ’s fault but the guy who should have kept his campaign managers word and not run for a second term y’all made your bed got ta sleep in it now
biden should have known better
if you argue with a fool onlookers may not be able to tell the difference and do n't mud wrestle with a pig unless you like it comes to mind
we all know what he just said is a load of malarkey here 's what i 'm gon na do
preserve democracy by preventing a convicted felon and adjudicated rapist and known racist fascist from running fify
well it works well for both parties to keep the 3rd party out of the election debates
bullshit allowing a candidate to say whatever they like is wild just because the format is slightly better does n't give cnn a pass trump changed the rules 8 years ago the complete inability to adapt to him over and over again has doomed the us my fear is it is fucking over the entire world
honestly beyond that even the fault lays on the american people we have our priorities so mixed up for what constitutes a good leader it 's just insane i mean so what biden had a rough debate oh no well let 's all focus on that instead of the wannabe fascist who could n't bring himself to tell the truth about goddamn anything
you mean the part where anyone who commits treason is ineligible inciting a mob to raid the congress oversee actions to submit fake electors to fraudulently change the outcome steal secret documents tell everyone to lie and cover it up and then have them come up missing sounds treasonous to me
that ’s the most frustrating part let your old ass ego in the past the young voters do n’t want this and did n’t want him in the first place
and governed much to the left of where he was for most of his career i was n't much of a fan but after he won i thought ok 4 years to get over the drama and then we can get on with it instead he 's been extremely leftist which he never seemed to be before
inappropriate time to laugh but i just had a chuckle at trump vs dragon speaking naturally
newer voters may be catastrophizing not all of the rest of us are the stakes are too high and grown ups know that if you 're swayed by trump 's endless stream of bullshit that 's on you trump is the same traitorous criminal he 's always been only now he 's lost in court because he 's a loser a desperate pant shitting loser who will happily sell you for parts get a grip eta bot in my replies thinks his blah blah is something
no more copium please it 's too much
none of them do it 's strictly about the convicted felon label and nothing more
sounds like there was a lot of material for biden to work with
and biden pointed all that out so let the people see and let them decide it ’s a democracy
and if this is the best we got to fight that we ’re doomed
trump 's made an entire career out of it
a lot of politicians are pointing out the raspy voice is a smaller problem than a blowout it was n't good but there are worse things mr biden had done his homework and had the facts mr trump made all sorts of denials mr biden made good points
true but was it expected that he would run for president genuine question
more like their jobs rely on biden being president so they want to stave off any primary challenge
i watched exactly that happen in real time in the lefty subs
they worked themselves into a shoot brother
in a presidential debate given he is 1 2 possible people to be the next president i would argue he does belong there
i do n't trust anyone to properly fact check anyone though especially not in real time
if they fact checked trump they would have had to fact check biden 's lies too which would look far worse for democrats
that 's what trump did made poor white people think they were better that s why they like him
there is no exaggeration he really did try to interrupt the transfer of power and he and his co conspirators are being prosecuted in multiple states keep up that goose stepping fascist how dumb do you have to be to vote in a democratic election for someone who tried to seize power after losing
first gen american who comes from somali refugees you guys have no clue what an actual coup looks like
he was literally elected president once before came close a second time and has a damn good chance of winning his third try to say he is unfit seems a little disingenuous
how are you gon na say that when he wants people executed in less than 24 hours of a felony drug indictment he should be afforded zero protections and in this country you lose some rights as a felon you do n't lose your right to life often you do lose your right to vote
what about fucking traitors or do we fucking ignore that too
did you see that shit last night we ’re all dead
keep pushing the substack of someone extremely biased who says democracy will die if trump is elected that will really show how unbiased you are eyeroll
do n't mock obama by comparing him to the 2 most incapacitated people in the federal government
yup my favorite was when biden forgot about the marines he got killed anyways i do n’t judge anyone for supporting either side they both suck
but the convicted felon rapist traitor did n't literally throw up on himself while he was lying so you i mean we should make him your i mean our leader
could you expand on that all like what flat out lies you heard sure there were exaggerations some misleading facts and some overall grandstanding but that occurred on both sides
oh that 's just donald let 's not make a big deal about it
judge says e jean carroll allegation trump raped her is substantially true ’ in court dismissal donald trump suffered another legal reversal on monday losing his counterclaim for defamation against e jean carroll the writer against whom he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation and fined 5 m and who continues to pursue a separate defamation case against him dismissing the counterclaim a judge in new york lewis a kaplan said that when carroll repeated her allegation that trump raped her her words were “ substantially true ” kaplan also set out in detail why it may be said that trump raped carroll “ as the court explained in its recent decision denying mr trump ’s motion for a new trial on damages and other relief based on all of the evidence at trial and the jury ’s verdict as a whole the jury ’s finding that mr trump sexually abused ’ ms carroll implicitly determined that he forcibly penetrated her digitally in other words that mr trump in fact did rape ’ ms carroll as that term commonly is used and understood in contexts outside of the new york penal law ”
some people learn as toddlers that their parents will give them what they want just to make it stop and they never ever unlearn it especially when as in the case of trump it still works
steve jobs cried in meetings if they were n't going his way it was super effective apparently i 'd love to see trump crying but not for the same reasons
it just proves he ’s a spoilt child who never grew up
he had a bad debate so what he has an excellent track record you want to cast blame start with the people on the left whining about the candidate that they voted for blame the sophomoric grousing and infighting about our last and only hope to stop the festering nightmare
i am shocked shocked merrick do n't forget i 'm a republican garland would do that
jack smith would be a good replacement
oh cmon you really think that guy is able to appoint anything
then maybe someone else should have the job
it was decent but was that because he was reading a teleprompter is he actually on something seems like he does have a cold if he is like this often whom is running the show
he ’s been doing the job well for three and a half years but one poor debate performance means he ’s unfit who the fuck even cares about the debate we already know exactly what kind of president both candidates will be
i d still vote for a corpse over donald trump and i do n't think i 'm the only one who thinks this way whether biden wins or not is still up to us acting like you already lost does n't help the situation it only makes it more likely that a literal fascist wins
trump reminded us tonight that he is uniquely unfit for office and hostile to our democracy biden cold or hot frail or not is frankly the only viable choice
so what do you want pick someone over an incumbent 4 months before the election this is just crazy
he ’s old we get it the alternative is a vile human being who does n’t give a damn about you or me or america i ’ll take old i refuse to believe america should be run by leonard leo and the federalist society biden has my vote and anyone who did n’t pay attention to the lies trump told 50 in 90 minutes or the rambling incoherent non responses are deluding themselves into believing biden is unfit to lead and therefore trump would be a better choice foff
haha holy copium yourself trump got covid after being exposed because stupid exposed multiple people with it went to the the american non existent first world healthcare and received life saving monoclonal treatment for a pathogen of a pandemic he denied existed and he 's a loser twice and impeached twice and a felon 34 times and a cheater and a liar just an all around stinky loser that hates and wines but yeah tell me more about your golden god
cold medicine is typically sleep inducing
so easy to “ expose ” biden to a republican but to expose trump to a republican impossible
dude you 're gon na vote for a literal rapist
i 'm a simple man i see lmao in a political comment i downvote
we ’re not at war with any of those nations so they do n’t meet the necessary criteria to be enemies it ’s not treason it ’s criminal as all hell it ’s an immediate danger to national security it ’s a slam dunk of a criminal case with any judge who is n’t complicit but it ’s not treason the founding fathers gave the definition of treason a narrow and specific scope for good reasons
the us is n’t at war with russia
we ’re not at war with them so no
we ’re not at war with russia
haha sorry i figured everyone already knew the impeachment had to be successful at this point
half the country does n’t consider him a traitor our founding fathers were very familiar with political persecution and explicitly provide protections against it january 6th was n’t a great moment in our country but it simply was n’t a coup the 34 felonies that trump has been charged with are embarrassingly weak crimes i am not saying he did n’t commit worse crimes but democrats decided trump was al capone and they could take him down on technicalities
it was not and biden did not
it 's the implication that there are black jobs and white jobs and the black people have to do the black jobs and the white people have to do the white ones that 's ridiculously racist in reality people of any color should be able to do any job so assigning jobs to a certain race is dangerous
the debate format did biden no favours wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhat can you even imagine what would have happened without the format explicitly setting times and muting microphones which was absolutely because of trump
biden ’s team set the debate rules to try to control the narrative they failed to do so
so you think bidens problem last night was being disallowed from cutting into trump to correct him on the fly uh ok
biden wrestled a pig seems like he should have aoided wrestling a pig
they started arguing about golf dude cnn is not the only one at fault here
shifting blame away from those at fault is something hardline liberals do so no shock there
so what they 're just gon na stop trump every time he lies give him the ammo to say he 's being unfairly targeted
allowing a candidate to say whatever they like is wild he would n't have been allowed to say whatever he wanted if biden was lucid enough to effectively respond but he was n't it was a terrible performance from biden i 'm baffled to see people all over this sub trying to shift the blame as if the whole world did n't watch biden struggle to put together coherent thoughts and sounding like a dementia patient i do n't want trump to win this election but if that debate has an impact it 's biden 's fault and perhaps the dnc for not getting him to stand down as the candidate considering he 's been visibly mentally deteriorating for years now
we have our priorities so mixed up for what constitutes a good leader it 's just insane tbf being able to put forward coherent thoughts is a pretty big priority for leader especially one involved in as much world impacting negotiations and diplomacy as the potus biden could not do that yesterday a rough debate is one where the candidate struggles to find some words and misspeaks a couple times last night was n't a rough debate it was an embarassment i 'm in the uk and even all of our headlines are about how horrible biden performed blaming average people rather than the clear incompetance of even running someone struggling mentally like biden clearly is is such a lib move and why people on the left like me struggle to get behind the dems even in the uk we do n't want trump to win but it 's embarassing seeing people defend biden 's performance and instantly trying to shift blame onto just the average person
bullshit blaming citizens for this is absolute utter bullshit
the part where anyone who commits treason is ineligible has trump been convicted for any of this
seeing the debate i 'd be more worried about the part in the 25th that declares the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office
lol “ extremely leftist ” i wish
extremely leftist words mean nothing anymore
you should be catastrophizing my friend biden got absolutely pumped by someone as dreadful as donald time for bold action
i know you ’re right but i like seeing what they think it ’s always like “ he sexually assaulted stormy daniels ” or “ he misappropriated campaign donations ” none of them realize he just did what literally every other politician ever has done
apparently it was a concern but there were multiple concerns for going through with it the precedent if he found innocent he had denounced his us citizenship which removed of the context of why he did that did create a legal question if he could even be charged for treason and more my point is saying all this is that it never actually got that far if found innocent then technically he could have run for president the trial would have been held in va a csa state and there was a lot of fear about implications x200b
also a president should n’t need a fact checker to give them air cover is jake tapper gon na parachute in during a high stakes engagement at the un and assist biden if you ca n’t handle a debate that your own people negotiated the terms of
that lbj quote makes my eyes roll to the back of my head it ’s lofty pablum that sounds profound but that even he did n’t believe people are motivated by self interest first and foremost trump won by playing off the economic insecurity of rustbelt workers rustbelt workers that went for obama in 2008 and 2012 who flipped to biden in 2020 and who very well might flip back again as wages still have n’t caught up to inflation while the biden campaign is running on the economy being in tip top working order
the coup d'état project at the cline center an organization that is literally devoted to studying coups and coup attempts called it a coup attempt not all coups and or attempts need to follow the same pattern or involve the military
literally beer hall putsch we know what coups look like 1 6 was an attempted coup not all coups look like somali ones
they used it correctly you just do n’t like the fact that it ’s being discussed a self coup also called an autocoup from spanish autogolpe or coup from the top is a form of coup d'état in which a nation 's head having come to power through legal means tries to stay in power through illegal means
except he 's a felon a sexual predator and credibly accused of stealing top secret documents and may be responsible for the death of covert overseas agents that 's all pretty fucking prima facie unfit
he was unfit back then too but that does n’t really matter what matters is he ’s a criminal who attempted a coup he belongs in prison
lol just ignore all those pesky details
how are you gon na say that when he wants people executed in less than 24 hours of a felony drug indictment because i do n't think democratic rights should change based on the person felons should be able to run and vote when they ca n't there 's nothing stopping someone like trump arresting all his opponents then they ca nt run against him ever again
relax brother i ’m not your enemy he ’s not been convicted of treason has he until he has then as much as you ’re right that he ’s a traitor he also has a right to take part in democracy
bad hitler comparisons are not antisemitic that would be a really low bar
here are three off the top of my head i did n't have sex with a porn star nancy pelosi admitted that jan 6th was her fault democrats want abortions after birth
do n't forget his late ex wife
i like all that biden has put in place except for garland trump is a terrible person who wants to be a dictator like his best buddies vote blue
whoever is running the show they are doing a pretty good job and i would rather have them doing it than anyone associated with the criminal
he ’s fit to be president but not fit to campaign for it
yes he is unfit in my opinion in twenty or thirty years when books are written there will be accounts of how people around him managed his decline and carried water for him and so on its happened before with regan he is absolutely declining massively do you have another explanation for his performance it was an absolute disaster this was him on the most important event yet this was him pulling out all the stops i take no joy in writing this btw
means he ’s unfit no but it ’s seen that way that ’s all that matters
but what if the corpse was replaced by someone who is coherent enough to talk into a camera for 90 seconds would you be more likely to get out and vote that person into office instead of trump also how would you feel having biden decide policy or military action i would n’t want my grandparents to be anywhere near that stuff and it ’s the same with biden let him enjoy his final few years and let someone else do the work
i thought the same thing before last night i will never vote for trump i told myself i was voting for the whole administration and against the chaos and divisiveness that trump will bring back to the white house but i ca n’t stomach endorsing joe biden any longer because it is an endorsement of the incompetence of the democratic party and their inability to field a candidate that is simply able to stand on a stage for 30 minutes and be coherent the party put up hillary clinton in 2016 when they knew she was the only candidate that polled worse than trump they had four years to transition from biden to literally anyone else and they could n’t figure that out i ’m not holding my nose any longer i will vote down ballot but i ’m not voting for president
i genuinely do nt know what the best course is it has no bearing ln what i said being true
nobody has said donald would be a better choice in this comment thread btw you are joining dots that were not laid out by me or others what was said is that joe biden is now undeniably diminished and the fact he had a cold is neither here nor there in short this is a big problem that can no longer be wished away and must be actioned by the left
i understand the alternative it has no bearing on the fact joe biden is factually not up to the job he was nearly non functional
i m liberal we are not a cult here biden can be criticised
what makes you think we need to be “ at war ” with a foreign country for it to be considered our “ enemy ” are you just assuming that or do you have a source and do you mean there must be a congressional declaration of war so in that case vietnam korea iraq etc were not “ enemy ” nations and no one could be convicted of treason for aiding them i think you misunderstand the legal meaning of “ enemy ” i ’m not sure russia meets that definition but i ’m not sure it does n’t
we 're involved in yemen and somalia to this day i somehow doubt that nothing in those papers involved any of those theaters
the united states considers russia an adversary largely due to russia 's targeting of us citizens in cyberspace alongside historical tensions and military interventions in former soviet territories oct 31 2023
i think this is a stretch the context was talking about black employment levels and businesses opened by black people as far as i could tell they were n't talking about shoe shinning or whatever other racist archetype exist from the past
it 's literally just saying that the jobs of black people are being taken he said hispanic jobs too
i do n't think that is true both candidates had to agree to the rules
people are acting like not allowing interruptions is some kind of trump scheme and not the thing everyone wanted when trump constantly interrupted last time do they think a less structured more combative debate benefits the famously argumentative and aggressive joe biden over the equally infamous quiet and low energy trump i can see it now and for the record it would be hilarious joe constantly trying to say trump you 're lying man while trump goes dementia joe says what biden stammers and trump shouts old repeatedly until biden delivers a banger response like um he hey listen jack you 're uh uh uuuuuh you 're older i mean you 're old too
i did not say that at all his problem was trying to address trump 's lies and getting riled up cnn airing what trump said at all feels like the death of democracy
expect more from your media it is the prime reason the us is in the state it is
yes stop him correct him forfeit his time the alternative being having a presidential candidate stand up there saying democrats want post birth abortions or hundreds of thousands of people are being murdered by illegal immigrants is a far worse outcome
it should be clear to everyone by now that the traditional way of doing things has been exploited by trump not correcting for it is insane
was the president of the confederacy convicted of treason
and yet that is what they 're doing follow him across the country voting blindly buying his shoes the racism was the bonus they believed his lies about universal healthcare and how they 're going to help the poor they 're social status of being better than the poorest food stamp black man the social status is what ' people are holding onto they do n't know a single policy except closing the border
far from it y’all really afraid of rural and suburban racist and an majority unarmed street gang when joint military command is literally down the street and not beholden to trump or his “ coup ” sad
i ’m not a republican i ’d love to discuss a coup to tear down the two party established order ca n’t wait for the middle class to collectively come together to re do the stain of corporate capitalism
when he launched j6 he gave up that fucking right
the sex thing is rather inconsequential and not proven nancy pelosi did in fact assume some responsibility for national guard response on j6 the after birth abortion comment was given with context to the former virginia governor who on radio did say he would support euthanizing babies post birth albeit only in case of abnormalities that lead to low chance of survival so again not really flat out lies exaggerations sure but that 's debates
i mean he gave context to that specifically attributing it to the former governor of virginia who said on radio he would be ok with euthanizing babies post birth to his credit as well this was in the context of infants with abnormalities that would give a low chance of survival so there 's a lot to unpack with that comment was it a flat out lie though no
what happens in those history books in 20 or 30 years if trump wins wo n't reflect reality i would vote blue no matter the candidate because donald trump represents ending our country as we know it i agree with your premise i would like a better candidate but given the dnc 's complete disinterest and poor experience historically with running a challenger against an incumbent i 'm not going to get my hopes up i 'm still bitter about bernie but care more about our country than our stupid party that can not seem to get out of their own way biden should 've understood going into his first term that we needed a successor to appear early in his term i feel like they shopped it with gavin to a degree my question sits with all the experts around him that asked for this debate political suicide on something that should have been a slam dunk if it was a cold i 'd expect people like van jones and david axlerod to know about it last night immediately after just a very strange and disappointing turn in one of the worst presidential elections ever
i do n’t care who ’s carrying the water i care about results and biden has far exceeded my expectations the office is more than one man
the sad part is that you 're correct yet i 'm still going to have to vote for him in order to stop facism from taking over the country hell i 'm even gon na phonebank text for him because i do n't want to look my future kids in the eyes if trump wins and say i did n't do more i 'm pretty terrified of calling people but i realized the other day that there were hundreds of thousands of men who died to give me the freedom that i enjoy today the least i can do is sit my ass down and make phone calls to get out the vote no matter how uncomfortable i feel
at least learn how to spell reagan regan worked for reagan
what you re doing has a name denial
who is this wonderful person who can campaign in 6 weeks and convince people not to stay home in droves
so you 're ok with women in your life losing their rights because your big mad at the dnc sorry not buying it
vote blue no matter what we have no choice then win 2024 hope justice will deal with trump and plan for 2028
“ actioned by the left ” by standing behind supporting and voting for joe biden he is old he is n’t cognitively impaired he stutters he gave coherent answers offered policies and a vision for the future that is vastly different from anything leonard leo and trump are offering democrats have always struggled to support their own
he can be but what ’s the point now there ’s no other option it ’s biden or bust he ’s not quitting i would be mad at his advisors more 1 why not postpone debate if sick 2 why debate at all it ’s rarely helpful to the sitting president and since trump does not participate in the electoral process in good faith there is no reason to debate biden could have announced months ago that he will not debate someone who tries to overturn and undermine our electoral process and is not a good faith actor as demonstrated by the fact that he has yet to concede the 2020 election not to mention pending criminal prosecutions related to trump ’s election shenanigans easy peasy
lol a president has a cold and is old once on tv and his opponent is a drama addicted vain pathological liar and probably obvious russian asset traitor and biden has to go well gee it 's mighty wide of you to say you can criticize biden so centrist minded of you haha no one 's swallowing your boot and not voting for biden is a vote for trump you are n't liberal and you 're even less convincing
that does n’t meet the definition of treason
that does n’t contradict what i said and that does n’t make colluding with them treason it ’s all kinds of illegal but it ’s not treason russia is a hostile adversarial power with whom we are not at war
bidens camp was pushing harder for this a week of preparation at camp david with all the resources being executive of the wealthiest nation in human history can provide
biden 's team pushed for the mic muting no crowd etc they both wanted no rfk jr yes they had to agree to the rules however that just recognizes that trump compromised in order to make the debate happen because he knew the cognitive disparity would be on full display the rules just seemed to backfire and make trump look composed and at least capable of forming an argument biden was hard to understand even with an empty studio and no interruptions this is also what they expected to happen this is why this was the earliest debate ever these guys are n't even officially nominated to run for office
trump constantly interrupted last time hurt him badly in the election it made him seem like a loon the muted mics helped him it was a gift from the biden camp
oh come on “ cnn airing the answers of the candidate i do n’t like is the death of democracy ” it ’s a debate that ’s how it works both sides get to speak ideally lies by one party are called out by the other party because again that ’s how debates work and again biden was n’t up to the task i get it people are unhappy about how last night went and are looking to point fingers but this one is n’t on cnn sorry
our country is in the state it ’s in because of career politicians in the house and senate
again he will use that to his advantage the man turned being a convicted felon into a strength you do n't understand the enemy
was the president of the confederacy convicted of treason did he ever try to run for office again he was indicted and then given amnesty so technically speaking he very well may have been allowed to run
he swore an oath to another nation he did n’t need to be convicted
wow ok done with this convo i think i know what i ’m dealing with
he gave up the right to a fair trial
“ done in cases where there may be severe deformities there may be a fetus that ’s nonviable so in this particular example if a mother is in labor i can tell you exactly what would happen ” northam a pediatric neurosurgeon told washington radio station wtop “ the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that ’s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother ” using this quote to claim that democrats support abortions after birth is a flat out lie there 's no such thing as an abortion after the infant is born
so you 're ok with women in your life losing their rights because your big mad at the dnc not just women but also trans people gay people people of color the list goes on
i disagree sorry coherent answers like we beat medicaid come on man i think he 's a losing horse now that is all
agreed with your sensible post mortem the people around him see the decline surely they walked into this hoping it would be an on day or that he could pull it together or whatever the thinking was another possibility is that they thought trump would chicken out i would also bet good money that joe has been propped up by medication which i have no problem with medicines like provigil are used by professionals all day every day i have no issue with it but maybe those are n't cutting it anymore all i know is what i saw if donald gave the performance joe just gave people on here would be all over it just a thought for our side the next time we call the other end a cult or point out they are unwilling to criticize dear leader we have to be better
bullshit it is are you going to pretend most of what trump said was n't just insane lies hold the media to a higher standard
this subreddit wants russia style elections if you have n’t noticed yet anything short of a totalitarian regime where the dem candidate is already chosen and shoe horned in is the “ death of democracy ”
and who 's responsibility is it to shed light on the underhanded dealings of those career politicians
better than letting him spew insanity without consequence
if his puppet judges stop delaying we 'd all see the mountain of evidence hear the jury 's verdict and know if he 's guilty a colorado state court looked at enough of the evidence to say he committed enough train that he should n't be on the ballot buuuut state 's rights get overturned when convenient
even the beer hall putsch was put down by the significantly weaker german government and get this they put the bad mustache man in jail for it too
using your quote there is an allowance to kill a living baby no that 's what the word discussion means in that quote so let 's not be dense i agree there s scientifically no such thing as a post birth abortion do n't be pedantic we can both understand the colloquial lexicon
context biden gave the government the ability to negotiate medicare drug prices then trump went on to accuse him of wanting to destroy social security what the republicans ’ wet dream is to end social security trump lies 50 times in 90 minutes could n’t stop talking about the border which is closed took credit for things he never accomplished and gaslighted the country i ’ll still take old over a lying raping cheating vile felon cofeve
huh i genuinely do n’t understand what you ’re getting at a debate was hosted last night and cnn effectively hosted that debate anything else is just wishful thinking i ’m not thrilled trump got to air his lies but it ’s joe bidens job to counter those lies not cnn
i 'm so happy i left the dems after 2016 that was the year i voted hillary in the general my last dem vote and i still regret it these people want the very thing they accuse trump of the end of democracy as long as it 's their team ending it trump meanwhile wants the prestige and the salutes and the hail to the chief playing and portraits of himself and statues if he could get them he does n't care enough about democracy to end it let alone know how his vp will do the work he 'll take the credit and then it 'll be on to the next rep that according to reddit will be for real a fascist this time so much worse than trump literally hitler such smug self serving hypocrites with zero self awareness
that view is myopic all his lies will do will embolden his base not convince undecided voters preventing him from talking will do more to convince undecided voters as there will be some amount of plausible deniability coming into play biden needed to deliver to counter trump 's bs and he failed you can blame cnn all you want but at the end of the day the blame lies with biden 's unwillingness to step aside it 's rbg all over again
the baby is n't being killed this quote is referring specifically to non viable deliveries which once again does n't have anything to do with abortion it 's a flat out lie to take this quote and twist it to fit the democrats support post birth abortions claim
text lying%20by%20omission%2c%20also%20known to%20correct%20pre%2dexisting%20misconceptions is info on lying through omission saying democrats support post birth abortion and leaving it at that especially given the further context of how trump has said and used that phrase makes it a lie you 're either unfamiliar with this concept or making an intentional bad faith discussion akin to i 'm just asking questions i encourage everyone to ignore this guy and move on
no what ’s the point of a moderator if not to call out the lies if their only job were to ask questions they would be called a questioner it was absolutely their responsibility to counter the lies
no the quote very distinctly states that the baby has been resuscitated and is being kept comfortable that 's a living baby and some people do support euthanization in certain instances the former governor of virginia bring one of them who trump attributed contextualized the quote towards
that 's not what he said though he attributed the post birth abortion to what he considers bad democrat politicians specifically the former governor of virginia and then went on to say no one wants that not republicans or democrats
being kept comfortable is referring to while it 's still alive before it passes away hence non viable deliveries using abortion in this context is deliberately distorting the truth that 's all i have to say on this
you are going through mental gymnastics to sidestep the fact he lied almost all night
trump will lie cheat and steal his way to the presidency
i wish all the people calling biden genocide joe would just listen to this absolute chucklefuck speak and realize biden is by far and away not the most problematic candidate in this election
it would have been nice to see biden or the moderators call trump out for essentially using “ palestinian ” as a slur during the debate it would be nice now to hear biden and other democrats call it out after the debate
right before calling biden a palestinian trump also said about israel “ you should let them go and let them finish the job ” why is nobody talking about this
yeah whatever did you hear biden stutter tho
biden has been more sympathetic to palestinians compared to anyone else in years past so it makes sense where the comment came from
that jesus was born in judea the southernmost of the three traditional divisions of ancient palestine is probably too much critical thinking for these smooth brained maga cultists
nobody actually cares the other guy is the walking dead
he also brings a lot of hate
centrists and other he does n't enthuse me morons are going to sleepwalk us into an even worse domestic and global situation
both sides support israel and do n't recognize palestine
quote a hateful statement of trumps
lol tell me you did n't read the fucking article without telling me actually israel is the one that wants to keep going and you should let them go and let them finish the job he biden does n’t want to do it he 's become like a palestinian
sure he equated them with terrorists suggested they were bringing disease and poisoning the blood whatever that means we know they 're terrorists nobody has ever seen anything like we 're witnessing right now it is a very sad thing for our country it 's poisoning the blood of our country it 's so bad and people are coming in with disease people are coming in with every possible thing that you could have
donald trump got into politics by insisting that obama was born in kenya that was the issue that he thought he needed to get involved on he has done nothing but validate his base 's hatred with an unending river of bullshit since the day he came down that escalator
then why did biden give 8 billion to israel
the point is n’t that biden ’s an anti zionist who ’s dragging netanyahu into a jail cell or anything it ’s that there is a clear moral difference between a candidate who uses “ palestinian ” like it ’s the n word and who promises to let israel “ finish the job ” and the other who is at least attempting to limit israel in some regards see the cease fire deals for example something trump would never do and has obviously lead to less palestinian deaths the simple fact is that if trump was president today even more palestinians would be dead and it ’s concerning that some of the supposed advocates just seem so indifferent to that fact a real “ with friends like these ” situation which is a shame considering the enemy palestinians do have
both sides just ignore the fact that trump literally said israel should finish the job
“ i know i ’m not a young man to state the obvious ” he said to raucous applause “ folks i do n’t walk as easy as i used to i do n’t speak as smoothly as i used to i do n’t debate as well as i used to but i know what i do know i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong and i know how to do this job ” the quote in the title and in the article are taken from biden 's nc rally after the debate for those interested here is the video edit watching the video of the rally there was a little more to the quote than included in the article i know how to get things done and i know what millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up ”
where the hell was this guy last night
this was after the debate with trump what the absolute hell i wish this biden was on that stage at the debate
biden does know how to govern the issue is that the average american cares more about vibes and how you present yourself
doing the job as president of the united states means surrounding yourself with the best people and then getting out of their way and letting them do their jobs that 's not an easy task but it does n't require that you be a gifted speaker or a master debater
oh ffs the amount of excuses on here is pretty pathetic he 's clearly far too old pretending like this is n't a huge issue is ignoring blatant reality he 's simply not fit to debate him and as such he 's a huge liability democrats have absolutely made a mess of this they should have been working on a replacement the second they won the election the cost of their incompetence could be absolutely catastrophic for the world
he really did fantastic at the rally night and day difference between that and the debate just got ta wonder which is the real biden at this point and why did he fumble so much during the debate
the fact that trump uttered lie after lie but literally all the heat is on biden for being a old and b a mediocre debater which he has kind of always been tells you everything you need to know about the supposed liberal bias in the media
look trump aggressively floods the zone with bs it ’s a completely different animal to deal with biden likely over prepared and had a zillion different comebacks that workshopped well and did n’t translate to the debate it does n’t matter to me i know trump is a monster i know biden is a good president the rest is fluff i will vote accordingly
if this debate and the issues it ’s had created around it happened a year ago there ’d be plenty of opportunity to change course we ’ve got 4 months and change there ’s zero opportunity to reverse course the last stop was a while back we ’re here now do what we can with what we have and what we can do is stop trump nothing comes before that
i ’m still voting for him
i honestly feel bad for joe the guy is clearly not and has never been a stellar public speaker he is a dedicated public servant and that much is clear the us deserves that much anyways
just let whitmer shapiro or kelly take over please also we know you r politics member are going to vote to biden no matter what but the debate was n’t about your vote it was for the 4 undecided voters in wisconsin who are inevitably going to decide the election and their biggest concern bidens age just got validated on national tv swing voters do n’t care about policy or lies they care about optics that s the one thing biden does n’t have
if trump was actually talking policies and not just spewing nonsense then we would be in a deeper hole i believe he can climb out of this one and get everything back on track
honestly this poor old man has been through so much shit in his life and he ’s the one who stepped up in order to save our democracy when no one else in the democratic party seems to have the balls to do so i appreciate the energy from the audience hyping him up after an awful night having to debate a traitorous lying felon who is also running for president people might not like it but he ’s the guy vote vote vote
he is 82 now and will be 86 at the end of his next term it ’s not that he had a bad night it ’s that he may be too old to do the job that ’s the fear people have and he proved this to be a well founded fear he ’d have to make daily vigorous speeches and give strong interviews to put this idea to rest but he has n’t and he wo n’t bc in fact he looks sounds acts like a very old man who is a shell of his former self it ’s plain before our eyes i ’m sad and incredibly angry that people close to him did n’t do more to urge him to stick to one term yes i will vote for him but i ’m not who matters it ’s the swing voters in a few states who will decide and this will convince enough of them that they ca n’t vote for him again it ’s selfish for him to keep going
running the country is n’t about yelling the loudest into a microphone
you know one unironically good thing that has come out of this debate the reaffirmation that despite everything people behind biden have something that trump voters have never had the ability to admit when their preferred candidate has a weak moment absolutely nobody is trying to spin biden ’s performance he did n’t perform well period imagine if this were trump and how many conspiracy theories would be on truth social and all the other usual wave of bullshit we ’ve become accustomed to there still plenty of campaign left and hopefully this is a wake up call to people who ignored the primaries because if people showed up for the primaries we could actually end up with a younger candidate
probably one of the better responses he could have had tbh i can appreciate the honesty and taking ownership that he did poorly
as the last president made perfectly clear it ’s absolutely unnecessary to speak clearly to be the best president ever maybe biden should pad his resume with some felonies
all these old people refuse to step aside for younger generation of talent is destroying all the progress look at what happened with rbg imagine if she had step down during obama era like so many people asked her to the ego of old people is screwing up all young people for generations
he ’s doing the job right now i may not agree with him on everything but he ’s doing a helluva better job than cheeto benito did
last night ’s debate was rough i was so frustrated why could n’t we had this energy last night i heard he ’s had a cold and debating with 2 min answers and 1 minute rebuttals with a stutter and being old not the greatest situation plus debating a lying liar but i ’m still supporting joe and i know he ’s got a good team the alternative is frightening beyond words have a good weekend
it astonishes me that people have overreacted and jumped ship on biden for one bad debate night yet we ’ve had 8 bad years of trump all the convictions indictments felonies and impeachments and people wanna sign up for 4 more years of that assholery sign me up for mummbly grandpa anytime
unfortunately these debates have turned into less about facts and more about appearance i ’m shocked at how people think trump “ won ” the debate based on how he sounded and looked he fucking lied the whole time
i know how to do this job that is no longer the point the point is whether you inspire people to vote for you after last night you do n't provide such inspiration to several segments of society including young voters and that could very well allow trump to be elected please do what good for the country and withdraw from the election
from semafor 's caroline anders the vigorous defiant president joe biden who took the stage at a north carolina rally on friday stood in stark contrast to the hoarse hesitant man who debated his republican challenger the night before “ i know i ’m not a young man to state the obvious ” he said to raucous applause “ folks i do n’t walk as easy as i used to i do n’t speak as smoothly as i used to i do n’t debate as well as i used to but i know what i do know i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong and i know how to do this job ” biden ’s energetic speech seemed engineered to limit damage from the night before when his underwhelming performance against former president donald trump set off a fresh wave of panic through the democratic party
the dnc is still living in an age where a democrat can be elected governor of arkansas
the daily job does not involve debates in real time
sounded like a completely different person this is the biden we needed last night but he ’s always been so bad at debates it ’s like he tries too hard to find the right words and not stutter that he ends up mumbling and mixing up words meanwhile trump will confidently say the craziest lies you ’ve ever heard without a second of hesitation either way i think the last 4 years of biden ’s policies say a lot more about his ability to lead than a single 2 hour debate people act like the president needs to make split second life and death decisions constantly but good leaders take time to think through a situation before coming to a decision and that ’s what biden is good at also the comments on every post talking about how biden needs to give up the nomination are extremely annoying and not subtle at all they ’re either conservatives trolling the channel or liberals that would throw away the election because of one bad debate not only will biden not step down him stepping down would hand the win to trump since no dems are even close to beating him in the polls except biden
please do n’t let the democrats circle the wagons like this stand aside biden it ’s time let someone have a real chance at beating trump
he 's going to be under a microscope after last night not that he was n't already but it was pretty important that he show some rebound and he did i do n't think there 's any one thing he can do but he 's going to have to build back people 's confidence step by step and getting videos of events like this out there will help
the issue for undecided voters is not does he know how to do the job it 's can he represent america as strong and secure to our peers and enemies this election is the most extreme example of having only two bad choices and the electorate is exhausted
joe there 's only one thing you can do to limit the debate damage step aside and let one of the young popular democrats sitting on the bench step in
none of those people win with four months until election day maybe newsome because he already has a pretty big donation and campaign machine in place all the other names either lack name recognition experience or both and let ’s face it this country is n’t at a point where they ’re electing a gay man to be president i do n’t think a woman could win with just four months time it ’s unfortunate but it ’s where we ’re at the moderate voters that are crossing over to vote for biden over trump are not there yet socially
a beacon of hope thank you president biden for level headed leadership that focuses on solving actual problems truly inspirational now more than ever we need leaders who are practically immune to social media hysteria
yes this is the way
i know how to do this job i believe you but can you do it for four more years
we know he can do the job of president in that respect he 's been one of the best in the past 75 years what we 're not sure of is if he can do the job of candidate he did in 2020 so there 's evidence he can and he 's been fine up until last night but last night was n't just a failure it was a massive failure and it 's going to take a lot to win back the confidence of both pundits and the public and it 's going to take a lot from the public to convince apathetic and non voters to support him give the amount of anti biden propaganda that will be pushed on social media and in regular media over the next few months
what will his mental state be in 2 years
biden is old and was sick trump lied every other word out of his mouth how is this not the headlines
reality is still on his side
i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong ok prove it then drop out of the race
my i know how to do this job t shirt has people asking a lot of questions already answered by my shirt
i believe he can do the job i just do n't believe he can win everyone who has had to put up with trump 's consequence free blathering idiocy over the past 8 years has fantasized about what they would say if they could speak straight to his face biden had that opportunity and turned that dream into a nightmare
what damage are people really saying biden is unfit for president are these people not seeing the crazy ass unscrupulous and immoral candidate he 's running against
my brother in christ the time for this was last night when you had a national audience
we are so fucked are n't we
he looked fine at that rally republicans are too afraid to face that reality
if he does then he did a piss poor job of showing it american politics is purely optics substance has never been the primary concern if you go up there and do nt at least project strength people will interpret that as weakness
it ’s like taking a drivers license away from an elderly grandparent yes they have logged thousands more hours on the road than any of us but that does n’t mean they should stay in the drivers seat bow out gracefully joe do what ’s right for the county
dang a rehearsed speech fed line by line off a teleprompter to a favorable audience totally cancels out the vacuous ramblings in an uncontrolled setting right fellas establishment democrats are just going to cope left and right until the big loss are n’t they
yes he did poorly but how do you argue with someone who no matter what just says nope i am right people think i am the greatest no matter what the question is i do n’t think it ’s smart for biden to step down this close to the election
commercial pilots are forced to retire at age 65 just saying
he has been a remarkably effective president even if you disagree with what he has done ca n't in good faith deny that he 's gotten a lot done
unfortunately for him most americans do n't think so and that 's kind of the problem
it 's really a shame that this guy did n't show up he needs to get rid of his debate prep team at the very least
can y' all imagine if 20 yrs ago we could tell younger us that we 'd be circling the wagons around a sundowning 81 year old who seizes up and mumbles through a debate because the opponent is a 77 year old brainfried fascist psychopath who has to take regular dementia tests lol this timeline is so beyond ridiculous that we 're normalizing the situation
i noticed biden was breathing heavily i can see his chest pumping up and down i think it got the best of him that he just wanted to rip trump 's head off and s down his throat he was angry and he tried to keep his composure which threw him off
biden is not a good communicator but a result driven guy he is better at bricking results but sucks at communicating it only the real “ woke ” voters will see this
i believe him biden is the kind of president who does n’t rock the boat and i have really appreciated the stability of the government during his first term do any of you really need to be reminded of the daily chaos that were the trump years
i 've been thinking all day how to articulate my argument to the new ' never biden ' hysteria crowd and i 've decided the best way is to pull a fetterman and be blunt you want to force joe biden off the ticket fine to pull that off without wrecking the democratic party and throwing the election we 'd need a replacement candidate whp could not just beat trump but utterly crush trump to do that we 'd need every vote we could get that means appealing to the quiet minority of republicans who as things stand will stay home rather than vote for trump we 'd need a candidate these people would be more strongly motivated to vote for than programmed by a generation of fox ' news ' to vote against and the top three candidates are a california liberal an african american woman and a gay man bluntly what we 'd need is a young charismatic straight white male not from california oh and he needs to pull off the miracle of uniting democrats like herding cats as well as appealing to disaffected republicans where is this paragon what orifice have you got him stashed in
sundowners maybe do it earlier than his bedtime idk
did they get that from the closed captions or because it was hard to understand half the shit our president said it was like watching eric cartman debate timmy burch
also check the gist gallup it 's what trump did
he does his job well he just does n’t do his brain well anymore
sure he knows how his body just is n't capable the people around him are ghouls for letting him run again and lying to the public about how advanced his decline is he is now what republicans tried to say he was the first election
was n't that bad did n't see a big problem i did n't like his state of the union because of coughing
it seemed like biden along with appearing tired was trying to make himself sound quick and energetic and in doing so he made a big mistake stutterers make when speaking extemporaneously usually they have to slow down and give some thought to what they are going to say i ’m no speech expert and my observation is based on what a friend ’s dad told me about his experience with a stutter and public speaking he always spoke slowly and deliberately and even with notes he would get stuck and his tick was a couple of silent pa pa pas before he could get back on track
yes the debate was tough to watch now that it ’s over let ’s take a step back and evaluate biden is currently running a country that is so divided and literally being destroyed by the rigged trump supreme court and a workless republican congress sucking on trump like the leches they are that his mind must be in overdrive 24 7 trump on the other hand is a brainless narcissist currently scheming 24 7 on how he is going to destroy everything and everyone in the world who did him wrong the last thing trump has on his mind is how to run a country and make it better trump has no path forward other than destruction and trump did not answer one question this is the most crucial and critical election of our time and the choice is democracy or a dictatorship btw those who support trump will learn the brutal consequences when they no longer are allowed to live a life of the freedoms we now take for granted trump will turn us into a dictatorship and he will turn on everyone that was devoted to him and trust this his devoted supporters are no exception
i mean he really does the way he handled the lead up to the russian invasion of ukraine was some top notch statesmanship
but can you at this point that 's what the average voter is worried about
honestly i just feel bad seeing him struggling up there
then do it wtf happened last night that was the moment to prove it what the hell happened
this debate was a stupid idea both candidates have administrations to look at it 's clear which is better for the country
it 's not about whether you can do the job dude it 's about whether enough voters think you can and about 75 % do n't think so it ai n't fair but it 's reality and you need to step aside for the good of the country joe
what the actual fuck where was this energy last night here he still sounds old but he 's sharp and coherent with some spark for good measure
great energy in that he talked all his great points wish he had that same spunk in the debate
jesus christ this video is so aggravating why the fuck could n’t that have been debate biden i guess when he ’s on he ’s on when he ’s off he ’s really off i think in terms of actual policies i still have a lot of issues with him but he ’s the most president since at least lbj if not fdr people at that age should n’t be president and his debate performance is abhorrent let ’s not sugarcoat it and act like it was n’t a massive problem but he clearly is n’t completely out of it mentally i wish we could have had whitmer or beshar instead but in terms of policy despite some of my gripes i ’ll take his policy over any president in the last 50 years i do n’t even know what i ’m saying right now i ’m just rambling i ’m tired boss i do n’t want to deal with this 2025 hellscape hanging above all our heads and it seems like we ’re barreling right fucking for it do we replace biden at this point i feel like whatever we do is gon na result in us losing a vote replace biden we did it too late loss keep biden he ’s too old so he loses the election everybody ’s got ta vote at this point we ’re the underdogs and we all need to scrap and claw our way towards a democrat win at this point
too damn old step down
debating is different than just giving generally rehearsed speeches
1 biden ’s old and debate settings are tough to quickly regurgitate stats facts and counters 2 i think the debate prep team way over prepped him with word for word talking points that he struggled to piece together with off the wall attacks from trump they need to just let biden be biden like he was at the sotu and the 2020 debate 3 when you try and wrestle a pig you both get dirty but the pig likes it debating trump is worthless for everyone and i mean everyone a normal debate you at least get to hear each candidates policy points on actual issues you do n’t get that with trump and tbh i ’m not sure we ’ve seen a normal debate in some time
i wonder if the format of the debate had anything to do with it when you only have two minutes for a topic you ’re probably just trying to repeat certain talking points that you memorized rather than being an actual debate or letting people ’s personalities come though it felt more like a high school presentation where you have sort of memorized a bunch of talking points like you have two minutes hit point a b c d in exactly two minutes there ’s very little time to go off script rather than say things in their own words it ’s just repeating back a bunch of scripted responses that ’s part way why i feel biden made so many mistakes even if they were minor he ’s speaking from metal cue cards and not from the heart we already know where each candidate stands on the issues trump just says it ’s a lie everything was the best under him and everything is the worst under biden let ’s get some substance and not just avoid the questions
the sun was up i say that as a shaken biden supporter he 's going to have to bring this energy every appearance going forward if he 's having good days and bad days then we 're sunk
sick tired sundowning sure would be nice to know this was the guy i was expecting though
sick thirsty and fighting a speech impediment in front of an audience of 300 million people looking for an excuse to call you old and incompetent so cnn
in the debate they had 1 2 minutes to string together coherent answers to complex questions which is why two 80 something year olds struggled one was n't coherent and the other could n't even answer the questions just yelled the same things over and over like a lunatic
too little too late how in the hell did the democratic party have four years to field a candidate to beat trump and utterly fail this is ridiculous trump is a threat to democracy but so is a party that puts up a visibly incoherent octogenarian against him
asking myself the same thing
biden had a teleprompter during the speech and did n’t have to think about what he was saying
i 'm betting he took too much cold medicine yesterday
i think the next debate should be at 9 am
cough medicine why is n’t this the first conclusion for everyone they said he had a cold surmise y’ all
unfortunately a lot of people may be saying the same thing on vote night
we ca n’t rely on biden to be strong but we can rely on his administration to guide him and or take over
it looked like he was flustered and worried about the time limit he looked like he was trying to play a game of perfection during each question and rebuttal
not having access to a teleprompter
this just puts a nail in the coffin for all the chatter about his mental ability him avoiding open questions from reporters and his limited sit down interviews that guy was not there last night because he ’s not that guy pal
dazed by cold meds pretty obvious he was sick
he did n’t have a teleprompter last night today he did as is clearly shown
stunned into silence by the river of bullshit that was a gish gallop with the moderators asleep at the switch the tragedy of our country was not us propping up an old man but giving credence to the torrent of whining lies and treating this as if it was somehow normal
dude was still getting over a cold still is judging by the multiple times he had to clear his throat in this speec
he was n't reading a teleprompter last night
he is much worse in the evenings which is why he shouldn not have done this debate and should not hold the highest office in the land no way he should be running
fresh biden clones need some time to warm up
jesus christ if that version of biden was present last night i would ’ve slept like a fucking baby god damnit i ’m glad there ’s one more debate but this is outrageously stressful
also that debate was one of the only times people who do n’t pay attention to biden actually get a feel for how he is as a candidate and president this was a terrible moment for him did he not watch himself that ’s how people who are undecided or considered leaning left are going to assume he is for the rest of the election
where was this man last night what a stunning speech
wow the guy really feeds off the energy of the crowd i think that was a huge part of why biden stumbled last night no audience meant he had no idea how his talking points his facial expressions etc were landing with the american people so he could n't adjust on the fly contrast that with trump who never notices anything but the sound of his own voice anyway
what a massive difference maybe he just does n't do well talking to jake and dana alone without a crowd
is it me or did biden say his son was a vietnam vet beginning is incoherent too glad he has the energy and they should 've given him whatever cocktail he had for the speech earlier but not sure if it 's enough see clip
had this same thought yesterday knowing how to govern is n't as important as being capable of beating trump in the next few months which is sad
we ’re fucked because the average american is too dumb to understand this and if they reelect trump and the tariffs fuck us among other things they ’ll never see their role in it
i think they ’re also a bit concerned that the president needs to be able to be fully coherent past 9 pm on the east coast
exactly americans have become idiots and i say that as an american in a liberal city in california we need to totally revamp our education system and teach some basic critical thinking to our kids so they do n’t grow to be voters who make decisions based on vibes
to be fair as the face of the country it ’s kind of important how you present yourself having a half asleep older person who seizes up and does n’t know what he is saying half the time is n’t good sadly that is still way better than the alternative so we accept what is available
it is unfortunate how correct this is biden has done a pretty darn good job the last four years if a republican of any age has his record they would be winning in a landslide we listen to the media narrative too much
well the average american fucking sucks then
for better or worse human nature compels most people to want to see a strong leader that makes us want to follow them but that ’s not really news to the dnc so why how did they let this happen i think there the question to ask and to see them try to join the lockstep soldier voter train that the gop uses yeah that ’s problematic to me
well when you are talking with other heads of state on a global stage that shit matters biden needs to go
let 's not forget who you 'd want to have a beer with even though they do n't have a brain in their head gwb
a good chunk of the job of president is being an effective communicator because you know the president is both a major public policy leader and americans chief diplomat fundamentally they need to be able to you know communicate
it does require you to be able to get swing voters to vote for you that probably wo n't happen after this disaster of a debate
trump is still trump though better to vote for a sedate but qualified guy than someone who is walking poison
it does n’t matter the debate optics are already burned in
it ’s because this was a teleprompter led speech to an audience that overwhelmingly supports him all he has to do is read rehearsed lines the debate showed outside of those confines he does n’t really have much in the tank and gets steamrolled on the spot
the rally biden has him reading a teleprompter so as long as he can read he should be ok being put in a situation where he has to think on his feet is how we got the debate performance he ’s not capable
dude wrecked paul ryan in the 2012 vp debate
as terrible as biden was yesterday and he was terrible the moderators were worse they pushed back on nothing they moderated nothing might as well have given the candidates a piece of paper with questions on it
it really exposes the underbelly of the general us population and that is they 're fucking stupid and deserve whatever trump unleashes
disagree but it would have to happen now newsom and buttigieg maybe whitmer and booker have enough public recognition i guarantee if they announced on monday that biden was retiring and put one of those people forward dem voters and never trumpers would get behind it and they have a good chance of bringing back a lot of the people that are sitting it out because of biden note i ca n’t wait to vote for aoc for president but i think she ’d be too controversial of a choice at this time kamala has too many centrist and leftist haters
so is everyone in this thread but will the swing voters probably not
he 's been a national office holder since 1972 last night had nothing to do with his ability to speak in public
the problem is i do n't know that those 4 undecided swing voters are going to get real excited to go out and vote from someone who 3 4 months out all of a sudden takes over as the d nominee
many countries candidates only run for a few months its not crazy anyone who the democrats pick will get tons of press and social media will get their name out there quick in today ’s information age its so much easier people do nt like biden they hate trump but why are we acting like biden was extremely popular most independents are looking for a reason to not vote for trump but if you put biden out there they may just stay home
kelly as in the astronaut reddit is getting so weird there is no one candidate that the entire country will coalesce around in four months you might be able to build a campaign for democrats around like a sandy hook teacher or parent but they would n't have the chops to run the country you 'd need name recognition amazing story and so fucking likable even trump would be nice to them and then they have to be able to run the country biden is old he had an off night and still seemed completely fine biden has never had optics and the swing voters have not cared before he 's a dude with a stutter who 's funny and charming and rambles he 's also been extremely competent at running an enormous country with solid policies all while the republican party throws tantrums every three seconds when he wins though i do hope his first order of business is to eliminate fox news once and for all
people need to get into family feud state of mind it ’s not what you think or what you would do it ’s what you think other people would say do you might be voting biden no matter what but not everyone is in fact some people saw last night and decided they had to vote trump to get that senile man away from the nuclear codes
we are incredibly lucky that haley did n't win the gop primary just imagine if there was a competent republican candidate
nope but it ’s about thinking critically and coherently undecided voters are n’t getting the warm and fuzzys after that
absolutely nobody is trying to spin biden ’s performance he did n’t perform well period he had a cold he was over prepared he has a stutter he was just flustered by trump 's lies he was lively in the post debate rally i do n't care how bad it was i d vote for a potato dead cat ham sandwich over trump idk i 've seen plenty of people here using these exact words to try to spin this i do n't think it helps anyone to refuse to admit that both candidates have a segment of supporters that have cult like behavior my dude
it 's something you do n't see much in politics i 'm happy to hear him admit he was n't good seems like most politicians try to gaslight us into thinking they 're perfect
which is why when young candidate buttigieg ran in the primary he received the youth vote oh wait that did n't happen because the democratic youth vote went to another well known old person named bernie sanders not even young people vote for young candidates policies over age any day
what you think does n't matter it 's only what swing voters think and after yesterday the idea that biden is a senile old man out of his mind is stronger than ever in national discourse
not to mention trump 's debate performance was awful he was just spouting random buzzwords and lies which is absolutely something someone with declining mental ability would do i do n't think he properly answered a single question and somehow we only noticed biden 's low energy performance if biden was just spewing bullshit he could have done better too i do n't by any means think biden is the absolute best we could have but trump is a bad person with bad policies and also has no substance in what he says
it ’s not people jumping ship as much as swing state voters who are on the fence worst case is former supporters sit out i do n’t see them jumping on the maga train
it 's not that we do n't want to vote for him it 's that we think he 's going to lose and beating trump is way more important these criticisms of his age did n't come from nowhere they 've been things everyone have been talking about for a long time now and they all got validated yesterday i do n't want to back a losing horse it 's not overreacting when everyone 's worried about the guy being senile acting senile on a night he absolutely could not fuck up
people do n’t want 4 more years of trump which is exactly why biden needs to step aside biden has n’t been all that great over the last few months his voice has changed and it ’s pretty apparent from watching speeches recently there will be more gaffs there will be more moments before folks could ignore it as gop nonsense now they saw it first hand there ’s a small sliver of doubt or truth or whatever
not only that but some of the stuff he was saying was completely unamerican
also it does n't matter if you know how to do the job if you 're doing a coin flip as to whether you will be capable of doing it on any given day
people are missing the inspiring point biden voters wo nt go vote for trump but they might stay home from lack of inspiration this has bad implications for down ballot elections too he could screw us out of a majority in the house and senate in addition to another trump presidency this is not the time to circle the wagons we need someone else
nah democrats circling the wagons and being unified for once is the best path to winning
so guaranteeing a second trump term i have to think all these people are republicans or bots pushing this
that 's never been much of an advantage in american politics
why so republican ags can file motions to keep the replacement candidate off of the ballot hell they ’ve already threatened to do that because the national convention occurs so late this is an l take
drop out with 4 months before the election what good would that do in your opinion
this is just whataboutism we all know trump sucks that ’s not the point
biden 's fitness is independent of the person he is running against
i hate to say this but the ones not facing reality are those that saw biden in that debate and think he 's a viable candidate he does n't have to win democrat votes he has to win those on the fence and energize the left he is a very old man it shows and was not what he needed to be when he needed to be
nobody cares about this speech and it will have absolutely no impact on the tsunami of rational calls begging the president to step aside
wow he got over that cold quick
yes democrats always bring a knife to a gun fight
he 's sick last night at the debate he was tired and worn down his words were n't ambling and his statements were n't incoherent he was quiet hard to hear and seemed to be hoarse his long pauses are because he has a stutter if people actually listened to what he was saying and critically evaluated the situation the narrative would be totally different biden has honestly never been a great public speaker last night 's debate required the listener to exert more effort to understand what biden was saying and as a result his competent answers were completely glossed over trump was loud rambled and spouted off a deluge of incoherent bullshit he 's a fabulous flim flam man and the usa loves a smooth talking snake oil salesman the choice is between a flawed old man and an incoherent fascist psychopath
he did n't have a teleprompter last night maybe that 's why he was better
maybe we should n’t ask people at that age to debate at 9pm what ’s wrong with doing it at noon and letting it air on repeat a couple of times for folks that are busy working far more importantly maybe we should n’t have candidates at this age to begin with in the future
it can really help to have an audience too
my thoughts exactly had this been joe last night he would have wiped up t like a poo stuck to his shoe i told my roomie that joe probably expected at least some decorum and actual moderation that did n't just let the opponent dodge the questions faster than his creditors
reading a teleprompter from a rehearsed speech is much easier than a debate with no help
are you serious it 's called a teleprompter
probably took his levadopa at the wrong time for the debate and the right time here
he can do it with the teleprompter it ’s not looking good my friends i truly wonder how many watched that were prior trump voters planning on maybe voting for biden who after having their fears about biden confirmed now vote for rfk
he rehearsed for the debate a hell of a lot more than he did for this speech
debates have never decided an election firey speeches in swing states have helped deliver gotv
it 's been like 12 hours how much did he reherse
which is annoying because 90 % of the president ’s job involves rehearsed speeches and not debates lol
he even looks better it ’s just the fact he ’s reading off a script
biden could have done the same as trump i e that 's a great question now i 'll talk about a different topic instead biden tried to answer the question the moderator asked
his closing at the debate was literally a rehearsed speech and he fumbled through it horribly i like biden i think he ’s actually been a good president during tough times if it ’s him vs trump i ’ll absolutely vote for him again because trump is wholly unfit to be anywhere near the white house and always was but fuuuuuuuuuck was last night a kick in the nuts that gave the gop a huge boost of momentum moving toward november that they absolutely do not deserve to have
it turns out biden can still read
when you try and wrestle a pig you both get dirty but the pig likes it debating trump is worthless for everyone and i mean everyone obama sanders newsom 2012 biden etc would have slaughtered that metaphorical pig literally at any point biden could have gone that made no sense i can just see newsom or sanders rebutting to trump 's we had h2o line with i had a glass of water right before this meeting we have h2o now what does that even mean
good days and bad days are still far better than intentional bad days every day from trump
trump gave biden the old costanza special george and elaine sit in a booth elaine speaking of jerry his father is driving me so crazy down at peterman 's george you know what i do at the yankees when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck elaine what george you schedule a late meeting elaine puzzlement huh what does that do george these old guys they 're up at 4 a m by two thirty they 're wiped animated how did we get back onto you elaine grabbing her bag and coat i got ta split elaine gets up and leaves george shouted after elaine you know i got nothing outta this
everyone uses a fucking teleprompter it 's standard equipment at speeches now days and has been for a long long time everyone sounds good with a teleprompter infront of them that 's why they exist
are we doing this teleprompter shit again
trump will not debate biden a second time
bet you slept like a baby after hillary ’s debates then all this knee jerk panicking is exactly what the media has been teeing up for the last year and y’ all are falling right into it enabling another 4 months of the same shit vote tell your friends and families to get educated on more than one debate and get them to vote
forreal i honestly could not sleep last night i was so flustered
he did n't have a teleprompter last night
dude was still getting over a cold he even still sounds like he is he has to keep clearing his throat
yeah an example of this is obama great speaker but when it came to actually governing he clashed with congress a lot and was n’t able to get as much done even though he had a supermajority for a little bit of time though the democratic makeup up back then was more conservative
that ’s how democracies end up unfortunately good intentioned people want to give the people a voice far a time they will elect the most competent leaders but eventually what will begin winning out are the people good at being elected rather than those good at governance the only thing likely to restore a democracy back to picking strong leadership is a massive event like a large scale war all out revolution or a dictatorship that is eventually overthrown
no we ’re fucked because the democratic party is n’t willing to adapt to the situation because they think they know better there ’s no reason to put all of our hope in this guy we have several candidates that can step in and beat trump and they ’ll accomplish just as much as biden
maybe but you have two options 1 stick to your guns because you ’re smarter than most americans and end up with fascism or 2 accept reality and replace him with one of several fully qualified candidates that can beat trump and accomplish the same shit
unfortunately a very accurate observation of the normal american voter
i ’m not sure swing voters actually exist by this time people who actually make the effort to vote have already made up their minds it ’s going to take more than a single debate performance to change their mind
it 's not just swing voters it 's also young and leftwing voters that feel his gaza policy has been awful last night 's debate would have done nothing to motivate those voters
anything is better than the mango mussolini but by god the democrats could n't have handled this any worse if they tried they should have been scouring for an effective replacement from the second they won the election trump was literally debating a zombie in front of the world
we get the choice between a lunatic and a corpse
not true hillary clearly “ won ” the debates in 2016 and yet all of her allegations were the reason she lost trump ’s criminal charges are going to speak louder than biden ’s blunders during this debate 5 months out before the conventions even happen and i say this as somebody who wishes the dems had pivoted to somebody else
will be forgotten in a week something more juicy will happen for the news to cling to and people forget things insanely fast
he did n't get steamrolled though trump just spewed his normal lies thing 's he has rehearsed thousands of times at his rallies and biden just called him out for it most of the time biggest problem was him stumbling and forgetting what he was saying
yeah that was uh 12 years ago
progressives need to win statewide elections before thinking about the presidency the only elected progressive caucus member in the senate is bernie and he did n’t even run as a democrat lol she needs to at least win a senate or governors race to be taken seriously as a national candidate maybe one day but nows not the time
dude there ’s a ton of leftists refusing to vote for biden because of palestine and way more people than that are reluctant to vote at all because these choices suck so hard these small percentages matter big time in an election that will come down to a few states the person just needs to be young have national recognition and not be trump or biden
that ’s true but we know that they are n’t excited to go out and vote for biden it ’s literally reflected in the polls they ’ve been telling us for months that he ’s too old nobody is voting for joe biden they ’re voting against donald trump a new candidate they ’re still voting against trump but there ’s some who might be voting for that new candidate too
this is the equivalent of throwing away a chance at victory in favor of a guaranteed loss
of course there ’s no one the entire country will coalesce around that does n’t mean biden ’s chances of winning are n’t bad and his decline is n’t obvious
i mean we ’re lucky in that she may have beat biden but i think anyone would have rather her beat trump than biden have to
i would never vote for her but haley is infinitely better than trump at least she wo n't get us nuked
i voted for pete although it is for policy bernie is too left wing for me regardless pete would destroyed trump in any debate
absolutely nobody who plans on voting d in this election is staying home
independents and apathetic voters will not vote for biden after that debate showing it will be a trump presidency barring catastrophic events occuring you can say he had a cold or that he has a stutter or cnn was n't fair or that sometimes he speaks well none of it matters the dnc is dropping the ball and any liberals who are shocked he loses can blame progressives all they want but this was coming from a mile away
how does it guarantee trump a second term to pit him against a young popular governor of a swing state it does n't by the way with all due respect i volunteered for biden in 2020 making calls on his behalf i donated to his campaign i believed in him and am grateful for what he did i am insulted that you would insinuate i 'm a republican bot
if the election is next week biden loses that ’s unacceptable hillary never did this bad
buddy if anything is guaranteeing a second trump term it was that bedshitting last night he ca n't win only being cognizant 75 % of the time
if you actually watched the debate you should n’t be saying this running someone who should be in a mental care facility against a fascist is not a tenable position
hubris this bullshit is exactly what will hand trump another term
it would give democrats their best and only hope at victory
i agree it 's risky but to not drop out is also very risky after last night base dems alone can not win the battleground states and joe did not win over any independents or swing voters last night for dems to spend the next 4 months saying he 's fit and fine will erode trust at a minimum and put us back into a position of banking on winning via ' never trump ' voters how 'd that go for hillary who actually won the debates trump can not be president again to keep that from happening the dems need to be honest with themselves and the public democracy may literally depend on it nobody is saying it will be easy it is indeed reality though
what fitness he had a bad debate in my opinion he 's never had a good debate in the last couple of elections fitness is just way to shift the spotlight off a terrible candidate and people on both sides are eating it up
1 the medicare line 2 the horrible biff on abortion 3 the closing line
i agree with you that he ’s sick but i disagree on most of what came after nobody was watching the debate last night expecting it to be about issues we knew how trump would act and we hoped that biden could appear to be able to stay up for an hour and a half past eight oclock pm and he absolutely fell flat on his face it was brutal to watch him lose his train of thought mix up names stand with his mouth agape and just flounder about in general this should have been an easy task and it could n’t have gone any worse i ’m a biden supporter but this guy is supposed to commander in chief of the armed forces i would n’t trust him to watch my toddler for 30 seconds much less be able to make important military decisions in the middle of the night when he has a cold shit is just insane to me nobody watching last night had changed their mind about who they ’re voting for but it does make a lot of people open to drastically new directions in 2028
on abortion which should have been a lay up here was his verbatim speech “ look there 's so many young women who have been including a young woman who just was murdered and he he went to the funeral the idea that she was murdered bya by by an immigrant coming in and they talk ahout that but here 's the deal there 's a lot of young women who are being raped by cheir by their in laws by their by their spouses brothers and sisters by just it 's just it 's just ridiculous and they can do nothing about it ”
i 'm going to vote for biden over trump because it 's a no brainer but biden was n't sick this is him on a bad day he 's having more bad days now as age is quickly catching up to him do n't try to gaslight us we know what we saw whoever prepped biden did n't do a good job either trump is going to lie we all know he 's going to lie two minutes is not enough time to explain what the truth is and get out your message too people do n't want to hear statistics and a debate with two minutes is n't really a great setting to try and use words to paint graphs and charts to illustrate why your administration is doing so much better than the previous administration much better to have a few canned lines and pull them out when you need them do n't tell stories just deliver lines like he did when he told trump his son was n't a sucker point out that trump tried to over throw the government point out that trump will do whatever the gop ask him to do and that includes signing a nationwide abortion ban keep trump on the defense by pointing out that he 's a 34 time convicted felon point out that trump withheld weapons from ukraine and emboldened putin to invade and that 's a big reason for high gas prices two minutes is not enough for nuanced explanations or rebuttals
i heard what joe biden was saying i understand critical thinking skills well enough that i can look past the stutter apparently the cold and hell the resting confused old man face and he still sounded confused based off of what he said my man was a fucking corpse when the topic of abortion comes up no life in his eyes while he ’s too busy trying to tie the topic of abortion to immigration despite knowing full well that immigration is all trump knows how to whine about even looking past how dumb it was to do that all he had to say to get a standing ovation was “ women have a right to make decisions about their body if i get reelected i ’ll work on putting in legislation that restores what roe v wade accomplished ” that was literally all he needed to say they practically tossed him an easy win and he still old manned his way through it and somehow you can see the signs of life light up in his eyes when you see him start going off on stupid old man bullshit that no one under the age of 60 gives a shit about in a politician like his fucking golf handicap and what presidential historians think about him and the rest of his debate was like that too the question about ukraine the stuff about covid the stuff about inflation literally the only reason why the majority of democrats would support him at all is because an inanimate rock would somehow still make a better president than the incoherent fascist otherwise there is no way biden in 2024 would n’t get cooked under any other normal election against a republican under the age of 55
we have eyes and ears he absolutely was rambling and incoherent last night unless you think we made sure everyone is eligible for covid and beat medicare was what he meant i mean the ' made everyone eligible for covid ' part is actually a true statement about his term and the utter failure to live up to his follow the science promise
the leader of the free world shouting be defeated by a cold i can work with a cold and my job is nowhere nearly that important too old time to move on
if he would n't have stood there with his mouth agape and just pretended to take some notes shake his head quietly in disagreement or several other benign debate appropriate mannerisms we would be in a lot better shape i do n't see how that has anything to do with whether he had a cold or not surely in the week he practiced simple stuff like posture and facial expressions were at least mentioned to him
a potatoe would be a better president than trump but biden clearly is n't mentally capable he needs to step aside if this party is n't a personality cult too
i love how when biden talks to the point that he ’s mumbling it ’s because he ’s aging when trump speaks literally with more cohesion than biden it ’s because he ’s a film flam man seems like you ’re blinded by your own arrogance and opinion biden barely formed a sentence that was understandable i had to rewind the video to hear what he was talking about while i understood what trump was saying was trump not being a loud mouth ofc he was was he more cohesive than biden abso fucking likely learn to see things for how they are biden is n’t your friend he did n’t know what he was even talking about and jumping from topic to topic staring at random things and just not even aware of what was going on at times awful awful candidate
i 'm very hard of hearing i did have to focus even more than usual to get all his words but i did get them the majority of people whining about it are most likely good ish or better hearing if i understand his words then they have no excuse
hopefully when china invades taiwan and the fate of the world rests on a meeting of xi and biden there 's a teleprompter for him to read otherwise we 're fucked
ya luckily a president will never need to be doing important things after 9 pm
i thought it was very odd when i first heard it was going to be at 9 pm i 'm 30 and i was tired as fuck was just planning on going to bed but i thought i would tune in anyway why do they have it so late anyway
so they can squeeze in an afternoon nap
i ’m guessing they wanted the entire family including the kids to be in the comfort of their home in front of the tv to be honest i did n’t get it either i was hyped for the debate all the way up until i heard 9 pm and i was like “ are you fucking kidding me y’all could n’t have done this earlier in the day when i ’m not going to be half asleep trying to drive home from work ”
if anything the conclusion iv come too is he over rehearesed and filled his brain up with too many random factioids and statistics and ended up tripping over all of it his answers felt like he was trying to cram 10 minutes worth of info into 2 a lot of the time
it looked like the bullshit waves emanating from trump were damaging biden 's ability to think due to close proximity
sure but debates involve more quick wit and response than just campaign speeches do you can rehearse but you never really know for certain what your opponent is going to say nor how he 's going to respond to what you say presidential debates have been about this quick back and forth banter for a long time now rather than a true debate and there 's also the element of appearance while not speaking which is n't a thing in campaign speeches
to be fair who tf can rehearse against trump biden blew it no one 's questioning that but cnn was supposed to have fact checking why did trump get to lie in every single question while not even answering the question also why tf is it so normalized that no one is even talking about that have you never been baffled by the nonsense after nonsense after nonsense maga pulls i know i have the interesting part is that this one went so well trump might agree to another one it 's going to be a long uphill battle but biden did save ukraine maybe he can save the us too again
reading a teleprompter is easier too he should have dropped out a year and a half ago dumbass i 'll still vote for him but wtf bro
i honestly think trump just rattles him he 's so unpleasant he does n't shake hands he did n't stay at the podium after the show ended he was mean and personal he 's said awful things about biden and his sons he 's legit just a mean pos bully and he gets under biden 's skin i do n't think any debate prep worked on biden and he was just shocked at what trump was bringing
but this speech had a telemprompter
dude should have just smoked blunts for a week and arrived completely unprepared
debates do n't decide an election narratives do the debate was bidens chance to correct the narrative that he is too old he failed the only way to correct that narrative is a full on media blitz and i do n't know if biden is capable
this is the first debate in history where the fundamental fear underlying a candidate 's fitness for office was confirmed for all to see so i would stop relying on past debates did n't matter as a crutch
no but see we ca n’t say that here even the most positive comment about his rally here is not allowed
do you have eyes he was incapable of formulating complete sentences within the first 15 minutes of the debate that was him free speaking with a prompter he does a very good job what ’s your excuse for the difference
that ’s fine he can do town halls probably will come out looking better anyways
that 's my biggest fear biden definitely needs the rematch now but i fear trump 's camp will decline future debates because they feel they got a win off of last night
i mean does it matter its not like trump is ever doing anything but ramble and lie anyway and his base does nt actually give a fuck about any debate or how he 's portrayed people considering not voting for biden because of this debate also clearly does not give a fuck about any sort of sane arguments both are old as shit makes nobody excited but one is immensly worse than the other
yup yup biden had a bad debate made some good points some bad stumbles and had a bad debate you could come up with reasons it happened relating to him being old and reasons not related as an aside i did n't really buy the whole he had a cold talking point but man he was coughing in that speech like a 40 year smoker so who knows and both could be valid but it does n't matter he had a bad debate four months out from the election and the media pounced on it 'cuz that 's how they make their money reddit 's gon na reddit 's though same reddit that did n't believe donald trump would stand trial until he did or that he 'd be convicted until he did never change reddit
i can worry and vote all my family except 1 are completely sold into maga i 'm probably the only democrat they speak to and they just consider me a looney and all my friends do n't really care about voting and people wonder why i 'm always a nervous wreck
i ’m sorry but in an america where the majority of americans fortunately or unfortunately are uninformed perception is reality it is a massive gamble to stick with joe biden through august because trump simply does not have to debate him again trump and the right ring propaganda machine has always been stronger than the lefts ’ and the simple objective of last nights debate was to dispel the narrative of “ being too old ” and biden did n’t do that on the biggest stage we deserve better and we ’d be foolish as a party to think in november this moment wo n’t come back to haunt us
that must be what conservative media is pushing because it 's the only explanation i keep seeing from people trying to cast doubt yes he has a teleprompter and he 's good at following with it i 've also seen trump get frustrated when the prompter gets wacky but the prompter does n't explain his energy and better voice if there 's another debate we need trump tested for drugs that kept him calm and for it to be 12hrs earlier at 9 am et
do n’t let the gop rewrite the story he clashed with congress because the gop made it their core strategy we had never seen that in the modern era
the democratic supermajority under obama lasted for a total of 8 weeks and the government was handling multiple wars global economic meltdown congress was putting out not one inferno left over from republican mismanagement under george w bush but several the republican congress under obama was literally focused only on making him a one term president how was he supposed to meet them halfway if their number 1 order of business was to fuck over the president
we have several candidates that can step in and beat trump and they ’ll accomplish just as much as biden okay name them
president aoc would be incredible
what reason does biden have to step aside he ’s had one of the most successful presidencies of a modern democrat and has done so with a divided congress
they do exist and they 've been polled low information as in they do n't follow politics voters in the swing states are the deciding votes in this election their main concern is biden being too old and possibly senile this debate will have all but confirmed this to these types of voters this line that there are no undecided voters is copium by people who spend all their time in left leaning online circles i do n't want a trump presidency which is why biden should drop out this is too important to screw up
it 's also young and leftwing voters that feel his gaza policy has been awful the fact that trump said netanyahu should finish the job and then refusing to answer if he 'd support a middle east solution with a palestinian state should alarm them more
i agree they should have led with someone else but trump was n’t debating anything he was just making shit up
because trump got the zingers in that matter in the 24 hour news cycle imagine all years and years of all that propaganda about clinton being a criminal and then having trump on stage saying because you 'd be in jail that hit harder than most democrats understand that was the only line that mattered for trump also biden 's blunders were not like any other the last weeks have been all about supposed dementia and this debate only served as more fuel to that fire this will not go away
he definitely got steam rolled not by trump but by himself the press and everyone who continues to talk about it
the truth does n't matter to anyone still sitting on the fence between these two cryptkeepers rational actors like you or i are n't going to decide the election it 'll be underinformed rural voters in purple states that will decide
yeah my point is that he used to be a good debater
right that ’s why i said newsom and buttigieg and specifically said she ’d be too controversial at this time did you read the comment at all
well then they ’ll be complicit in america ’s descent into fascism
you run into some issues with replacing biden assuming he even agrees in the first place funds raised for his campaign might not be allowed to be used the democrats lack a candidate they trust to get the same support from key demographics trump gets to go on a victory lap about how he was right about sleepy joe etc however something i have n't sent mentioned much is that this forces every single democrat who has said for months that biden is mentally sound to suddenly explain why that 's not the case they either admit they 've been lying for months or say that biden suddenly snapped live in front of the entire country for months i 've lurked and read people on reddit say that if anything trump is the one with dementia no one is seriously saying that anymore also if they say biden is too old does that mean he was always too old if not when did he become too old and which decisions were made by competent biden vs dementia too old biden
i think the problem is there are a bunch of people that feel that way about both options some think switching is throwing away the chance at victory and some think staying with biden is throwing away the chance at victory
i suppose it depends on whether she would have a better chance of beating biden compared to trump
this sort of comment is exactly why haley is so dangerous
heard that eight years ago
that ’s some trump level editorialization my friend
how does it guarantee trump a second term to pit him against a young popular governor of a swing state it does n't a very honest response is actually incumbency there 's a huge huge advantage given to the incumbent in terms of voter turn out that 's why it 's such a critical value and in part why term limits were imposed in the first place there is a much higher likelyhood of someone winning an election if they are already in the elected seat trump losing even though he was an incubent in 2020 is actually quite rare this is why most presidencies last 2 terms and why it 's rare to see them not professor allan lichtman who has predicted correctly which president will win for over 40 years denotes that one of the 13 keys to winning the presidency is to be the incumbent
hillary trash trump in debates it 's not even close yet she lost
if the election is next week biden loses and biden is only going to get older as time passes
luckily the election is not next week
incumbent advantage is the single biggest factor in predicting an election it 's astounding that the majority of you do n't understand political science 101 prominent poli sci professor and author allan lichtman whose 13 keys to the presidency model has correctly predicted 9 of the 10 last presidential elections including both 2016 and 2020 forget all of the pundits who have said biden ’s too old democrat ’s only chance to win is with biden running for re election
it was one debate if biden fumbles the next one then we 're in trouble but hinging your opinions of our country 's future on a single hour is a little crazy the american electorate forgets stuff like this very quickly
this was more than a bad debate he could n't finish his thoughts seriously watch it again
the point of the person you 're responding to is that the failures are the only things that are being focused on when for the most part if you put the effort in to try and listen closely it mostly made sense i do n't understand why he seemed better just a short while later when visiting the waffle house or why he 's a lot better the following day but he still has my vote because what trump is offering is the complete opposite of almost every thing that i value it 's possible he really did have an off night have n't we all imagine if you 're 81 and they 're going to focus on sharpening his image from here til november assuming he remain in the race next debate 10 am
“ look there are so many young women who have been including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral and the idea that she was murdered by an immigrant coming in to talk about that but here ’s the deal there ’s a lot of young women are being raped by their in laws by their by their spouses brothers and sisters by it ’s just ridiculous and they can do nothing about it and they try to arrest them and they cross state lines ” that 's not the direct quote of what he said
he was hitting blocks in that one the doubling of phrases and sudden changes to a different but essentially synonymous sentence are symptoms of a stutter which we know he has more specifically they are symptoms of speech therapy for a stutter you stop and change when you hit a block to avoid hitting the same word over and over his stutter is worse than normal there but nerves exhaustion and age can do that to you the statement makes sense once you take the stutter out of it though the blocks just make it seem like it is jumping topics but it is following an exact thread just one expressed badly in essence republicans are blocking abortions in the case of rape even in the case of incestuous rape then they arrest people going to other states to get abortions the last bit is the next line he is old he has a stutter he was sick and low energy all of that is true but his ideas are coherent even if he has having trouble talking
i ’m frankly furious about this answer specifically this is such a massive issue for women and he wiffed it so hard it was almost like he was n’t convinced why ending roe was a bad thing
you left off the sister in laws part i 'm just saying that if you are going to use the word verbatim make it count
abortion is healthcare and without it women will die we need legislation to protect the rights roe gave us for decades but no all we got was some weird garbage about how the three stages of pregnancy are the woman versus her doctor and the woman versus the state or something i do n't even fucking know when asked about unemployment for the black community he did the same shit started talking about how actually its way better now instead of saying we have no excuse not to have an equitable society
do n’t let perfect be the enemy of good would you prefer the guy who says immigrants are coming for “ black jobs ” the guy who takes a photo of a classified satellite image with his cell phone and posts it to social media without any redactions thus giving away a ton in us imagery capabilities to our adversaries the guy who had a mysterious one on one meeting with putin kicking out even the translator and then the months following found dozens of undercover us assets mysteriously dead or missing if you support democracy now is not the time to get all upset about biden appearing poorly in a debate now is the time to lock in support we only have four months nobody else has a chance of beating trump if you were waiting for a debate to maybe vote biden be honest with yourself you were never going to vote for biden stop concern trolling
he 's never been a good candidate those 81 million votes in 2020 were n't for biden they were against drumpf i 'll grant he 's done a pretty good job but the majority of people do n't want him the fact that he has n't been able to sell his accomplisments proves my point he 's never been a good politician he won before because drumpf was so bad but now 75 % of people think both are bad that means a lot of people stay home and that 's how drumpf can win
“ hopefully when china invades taiwan and the fate of the world rests on a meeting of xi and biden there 's a teleprompter for him to read otherwise we 're fucked ” this is such a provincial way of thinking yes because it ’s not like the u s china have entire foreign ministries state departments to manage their diplomacy if both leaders had to go into such high stakes negotiations they would certainly go into it without their respective team ’s experts s this reminds me of presidents trump ’s simple minded approach to foreign policy where he thought his personal relationship with world leaders was somehow going to override their political national interests
china has 5 10 years to invade taiwan once they get into the 2030s there are systemic issues in their society and military that will start to cripple their effectiveness in that invasion similar to why they ca n't just use their military to occupy and annex hong kong they have a difficult job of needing to take the islands without destroying the infrastructure that makes them valuable to hold
because half the country is on the pacific or mountain time including the most populated state
he should n't have spent so long preparing when someone already has a stutter and is getting older so memory is generally more difficult over prepping and trying to remember entire paragraphs with numbers and data is not effective he needs to let himself talk off the cuff not worry about numbers and just let his own train of thought run
call it a failed attempt to try and connect dots in trump 's gish gallop and get a dialog going biden could not get him to focus so he played along to make trump feel he was in a safe space
i noticed this too he wobbles out on stage and immediately starts spewing something so long and fast that his mouth and brain are not able to keep up and then he continues to do it throughout the entire debate his responses were very dense he was attempting to give as much information as possible i 've noticed some commenting on how slow biden is compared to trump but actually it 's the opposite that happened trump spoke at a normal pace and honestly said very little in many of his responses if biden were to have just taken a breath slowed the fuck down and just hit the main points of what he wanted to say it would have went a lot better because much of what he was actually saying did make sense aside from a few flubs but instead he tried to give too many details and it just came off as a confused delirious nursing home escapee undecideds and general voter apathy are 100 % going to lead us to another trump victory unfortunately
he forgot everything about polk high football but yeah he prepared for an old school debate he should have come for a schoolyard fight where 's melania when he lied have a few lines like stop lying to the american people instead they had him study statistics that he could n't recall correctly or in the right context they had all these nuanced topics they wanted him to cover when he should 've just put the stark choice front center i do n't know why i 'm ranting i just am so frustrated and thir response has been so bad we 'll get 'em next time is how you lose argh chill our i ca n't fucking chill out when i know that congresspeople wo n't be getting ticketed for sleeping in the street like all the people who will suffer for this fuckup we do n't have the luxury of taking this calmly
i agree felt like he was trying too hard to use data to back up his thoughts and answers vs standing on his record and reassuring people that he can keep doing the job he was trying to out think and out class a felon with half a brain cell who was going to spout whatever he wanted no matter what stat biden threw out
definitely felt that way on his first response
i feel like biden did n't know what to do with his time either there were no previously written notes and that 's hard to do if you ca n't back yourself up biden seems to be mixing several things together in his mind before speaking i feel like he panics when they shoot the gun because he is given a lot of time to speak of the top of his head the top of his head unfortunately takes a moment to buffer to completion i do think this job is too stressful for biden after last night he is entirely different than he was a decade ago and many long time democrats are saying that this is a disaster biden meeds to also go against other candidates than trump to prove that he 's got more to his campaign than not being him
over prep removes natural reaction interaction and boy he sure looked unnatural
agreed biden needs to biden
honestly if your job is to run for president in 2024 what is even the point of bothering to memorize all these statistics and facts if the average american citizen is apathetic at best about hearing a bunch of numbers then there ’s going to be an entire half under that average that hates listening to some fucking nerd throw out a bunch of statistics at them if anything having someone like that on stage makes them feel insecure and stupid that they ca n’t keep up with someone who ’s smart like that that ’s why trump works so well with the lowest common denominator he speaks their language and makes them feel secure in their own illiteracy that they ’re not going to be talked down to by some guy that they could n’t just go grab a beer with i mean fuck futurama pretty much nailed this shit like 20 years ago “ but that 's not why people watch tv clever things make people feel stupid and unexpected things make them feel scared ”
once again joe 's people have to learn the hard way that overpreparing him is potentially as bad as not preparing him at all for his whole career he has always done best with an audience and speaking off the cuff that means sometimes he gaffes but that 's better than the stunned sterile performance we saw at the debate
whoever was coaching him never took a speech class
plus he did two events that day if my 81 year old grandpa was trying to do three major things in one day i ’d tell him to slow down
i mean last time trump literally tried to damage biden with covid in close proximity
i 'd like to see you try to debate the 258 lies trump said every time he opened his mouth you ca n't the moderators ca n't fact check him and neither can his opponents people saying they could beat trump have never debated a total liar like him where do you start
meh biden was overthinking he has a cold trump is dangerous and they over prepared a man with a stutter biden is great off the cuff and he 's generally quite witty i 'm guessing he was also told not to snark at trump because coming from the president that looks like punching down but towards the end he seemed to decide eh fuck it the debate format favors republicans people want their republican candidate to be loud and curt they want their democratic candidate to be intelligent informed and nuanced
there ’s nothing that trump said that was surprising or unexpected
i mean he did n’t even have the energy when he answered the first question i would have agreed with your argument if he started out like he did in nc and got worse during the debate
you have 80 seconds remaining biden is there anything else you ’d like to say biden could n’t even fill half of the open time he was given to talk about literally anything he wanted to it was n’t just a failure of quick wit and response you can rehearse for question and open response it was just a general failure
did you see the debate there was n’t much back and forth banter
that ’s just it when you ’re up against a fire hose of bullshit you ca n’t spend the entire debate pushing back against it all trump knows this
so if the guy ’s brain is mush he ’s gon na have issues with a teleprompter too
yes and the bar could n’t have been set any lower for him and he underperformed it trump met expectations largely although to some he beat expectations by not going nuts and the format actually helped him
as a european it ’s mind boggling that this is a narrative at all people in your country are trying to extrapolate based on a debate how a guy would be as president who is currently the president it ’s absurd
nixon did n't lose his debate with kennedy he lost to tv viewers and won to radio listeners he also did n't give fiery speeches which may have been his biggest downfall that and being an ugly mf going against a sexy young chap
the idea that nixon lost that debate was concocted years later
haters on an offensive today
he ’s an old man with a stutter biden as a kid had to take charge ’ of the conversation to help him with his stutter but it ’s still a disability it probably would be best if he did n’t try to regurgitate bullet points but instead shorter summaries and spoke a little slower
except when he flubs one of them and that 's the only one that sees widespread play on the media
and the supermajority lasted all of about two months and it was very early in his presidency someone broke this down a while back franken 's election was tied up in recounts and it took a while for him to be seated at which point ted kennedy promptly shuffled off the coil
if anything obama 's failing was in his slowness to realize the gop was n't interested in giving a single inch negotiations were pointless from the start but he wasted time pretending he could be the great unifier
not j b pritzker i want him to stay here
newsom buttigieg whitmer schiff wyden maybe booker i think kamala has too many haters
newsome buttigede pritsker whitmeier brown or phillips
preach i will absolutely vote for her for pres someday but i want her to pick up a term or two in the senate and a secretary position if possible i also think she would be too controversial to throw in as our candidate in this situation
you would lose every single moderate vote instantly
the issue is neating trump no point in a great democratic candidate if they ca n't win the office that 's the sad reality we live in
newsome is a california progressive that ’s not even popular there anymore approval 50 % i do n’t think he moves the needle and he fared worse than biden in swing state polls and really only did well against a potential desantis matchup trump would n’t even debate him he ’d do much better than biden for sure i think only big gretch can save the party but she ’s not really a household name outside of people who follow politics
cool do you want to be right or do you want to avoid fascism
but if trump wins you ’ll say you wish haley won lol
i did n't ime a lot of people just did n't think trump could actually win it seemed too ridiculous to be possible we know the stakes now
i certainly did not they make fun of people doing that in an american horror story season for god ’s sake
why do you think it 's going to get better for biden
will he be able to de age cure parkinsons before the election
this worked for trump in 2020 so it 's coherent for biden to rely on this as his one and only hope
does it still apply when the incumbent 's net approval rating is so low going into an election that the closest historical similarities are to bush sr and jimmy carter
you assume the second debate scheduled in september will even take place let alone take place entirely too late the time is now
but you ca n't have an off night like that as president an 81 year old should have all the leeway to take rest and take a day off but they should n't be president
no the point above was to gaslight us rather than being honest that 's not how you win people over and get them to listen to you that 's how you make them feel insulted
a i watched the debate the wp ' quote ' is definitely cleaned up he was nowhere near that clear or coherent when actually saying that quote b uh it still makes no fucking sense
he answered a question about abortion by talking about someone being murdered by an illegal immigrant what part of that response is coherent
that sentence does not make any more sense when you remove the stutter what are you talking about
the cope is strong in this sub the dems best chance at winning is biden stepping aside denying that is denying reality just like denying his old age was a problem before last night where you ca n't hide from it
man there is no way in hell that you can look past his stutter and still feel like what he said was coherent if he somehow felt the need to pivot this toward talking about immigration which trump is infinitely more charismatic and better at talking about than him hell it was all he talked about last night
that 's not really surprising from an 80 year old catholic man it 's not a demographic known for holding fierce pro choice beliefs to put it mildly
tried my best to capture that disaster lol
the message from now til election day should be “ hey remember how this fuck wad tanked the country 4 years ago remember the scandals the impeachments that ’s what you ’re getting again but worse ”
yeah tbh even if he was younger biden simply has never been the kind of wonk who can rattle off 20 satistics like it 's nothing he knows policy sure but it 's like his debate prep team wanted him to be elizabeth warren which is just biden has never been that it 's never been his style he 's always been best speaking emotionally and connecting with people he 's more of a storyteller than a policy wonk basically
i think the stakes were perceived as super high frankly i think the guy was just nervous which sucked but does n't mean i support him any less biden 's weakness seems to be he 's just a regular old man which i can live with
this happens to me all the time and i 'm 35 like many people i 'm a terrible public speaker when i know i need to speak in front of a group of people i try to rehearse what i 'm going to say so i 'll be more confident but sometimes it backfires i lose track of what i 'm supposed to say and i end up saying something that i 'm not even sure about it 's really embarrassing but there are times when i 'm speaking off the cuff and i sound fine i know we expect our leaders to have a better sense of public speaking than most but i think it goes to show that joe is just a regular person even though he did n't do well i still think he can still be an effective leader
i actually do n’t think memory was a big issue here i think it was rhythm and scale of the circumstance ironically trump needs to be one on one to come across as somewhat normal conversely biden needs a crowd to project to and get into a rhythm this debate was effectively an interview and in that situation biden is significantly more soft spoken pair that with a speech impediment and biden comes across as far worse than he really is like his brain is going faster than the situation allows his mouth to move kind of like trying to ride a bike really really slow when you can project and flow from one point to another it ’s actually easier to speak i can relate personally to that phenomenon give me an audience i need to project to and i can suddenly orate quite well cracking jokes and making complete and compelling points but put me in a debate in a quiet room with just a few people and suddenly i ’m stammering over my words a mixing up the points i ’m trying to make
i ’m surprised it took me a while to see anyone talk about his stuttering i ’m not going to comment on his age and any kind of decline outside of saying i have no business doing so what i saw a lot from him last night was him having to pivot when he could n’t get the words out it ’s a common tactic with people who stutter but it really hurt his momentum when it came to him trying to convey something
yep i ’m sure the guy we saw can definitely debate off the cuff with zero issues
his campaign really screwed up asking for no audience at the debate yeah trump feeds off an audience but so does biden
that 's crazy dude should of taken the day off aside from the debate gone in 100 % rested up
c'm on you do n't respond since you know that trump is going to lie you just point out exasperated that it 's so demented in fact there 's a formula 1 you point out how peculiar the response was 2 you then lean into your talking points on the topic l0 headline l1 subhead l2 anecdote with more time you do more anecdotes or you expand example open wow how about that answer it 's weird let me answer the question l0 folks i 'm going to push for a return of the roe standard across the united states like it was before his judges overturned roe that 's a 2nd term priority for me and kamala l1 you know why you do n't shove bureaucrats and judges in between women and their doctors think about it we now have bureaucrats bureaucrats in multiple states trying to figure out if the woman 's life is in danger or was she raped was it incest it 's crazy l2 look at texas since they 've decided to take this bureaucratic approach to women 's healthcare maternal mortality is way up way up it 's dumb it 's a stupid use of tax payer 's money and it will stop during my second term
probably by calling him a felon or a snake oil salesman who is lying before making my points and encouraging people to look it up do somethong out the gate to get his temper going part of why i think i could knock the orange off trump in a debate is because i 've taught in classrooms where every student has a behavior issue and figure trump equates a lot of them at once down to intellect on issues granted with those students i was n't trying to press buttons to make them misbehave but some days it was inevitable when trump talked about the choice act biden should have thanked him for mentioning one of his accomplishments with obama
i 'll let the fact checkers debunk all those lies later here 's the answer to the question you asked and my opponent did n't answer rinse and repeat you can win agaisnt the gish gallop it 's not possible you just have ignore it or end run it
you do n’t debate trump ’s lies you ignore them biden did everything wrong last night
it ’s easy you talk directly to the american people even his base they know more than anyone that he ’s a liar and a fraud they pretend not to out of spite
there are strategies for debating people like trump that has been studied long before trump even came around and these debates are pretty much always more style than substance just come across as looking better than the opponent and you 'll win trump 's weakness is his temper and inability to control himself clinton worked that and polling on the debates showed her winning them pretty handily but that also goes to show that winning the debates does n't translate into winning the election
you could start by making sense like as a lifelong dem i feel the need to say the quiet part out loud yes trump lies a lot and biden was completely incapable of doing anything about it
you freaking say that “ look folks this guy over hear lies so much and so fast there s no way for anyone to reasonably respond or address all of it in real time so i ’m going to do my best to ensure that you the american voter have a better understanding of my platform and our accomplishments by the time this is over and if i remind you at any point that under his presidency the national debt tripled and we lost five million jobs and he cheated on his pregnant third wife with a porn star while on his way to being a convivted criminal well then that ’s just a bonus ”
going up against “ the liar ” is one of the types of opponents that competitive debaters have to practice against there are strategies against it whoever prepared biden did n’t do a good job
well putting together just one fully coherent response would ’ve been a start
it 's up to biden to fact check him he had plenty of time to do it he was even prompted by the moderators multiple times to use his full allotted time and he still did n't challenge trump 's lies it 's a debate that 's what you 're supposed to do moderators are not there to hold your hand you 're the president of the united states
i would have called him out on every single number and statistic he pulled out of his ass those numbers do n't sound right i 'd like to see the studies on those statistics etc etc and then fire back with a verifiable truth bomb idk something like that but maybe that 's asking too much of biden
no need to fact check every single thing he said was proven false 4 years ago he said absolutely nothing he has n’t said for a long time now
exactly you ca n't debate a liar
the amount of delusion in response to your question is hilarious no one here would be able to debate against trump he debated billionaires and highly influential political figures yet here we have redditors commenting how they could do better trump is by no means a good debater in any regard he plays dirty and uses toxic rhetoric and most of all he lies and spews twisted narratives
actually a couple of things were chief among them that he had discussed with putin that putin planned to invade ukraine before it happened biden could 've won the entire debate by blowing that wide open but he did n't even pounce on it though i take your meaning that biden should n't have been negatively surprised by anything trump said it was mostly the same old rehashed rhetoric if you can even call it that
we never did get to hear what his plan for affordable daycare would be i kept thinking that if he could nail that one it would resonate with a lot of voters right now people are suffocating under the expense of daycare
back and forth banter maybe was n't the best way to put it i meant reactionary responses
i ’m not a trump fan i just want to start with that reading a written speech and memorizing facts and figures and then recalling them are two entirely different things sure if his brain is mush he could n’t do either but it ’s apples to oranges comparing a debate to a pre written speech
this if trump was young handsome and had a hot wife and cute children we 'd be in trouble but given his kids are all dummies his wife wo n't even campaign with him she 's waiting on the divorce and he is ugly i 'm not worried
he also campaigned in all fifty states while kennedy focused on the swing states
i 'm also not sure he 's telegenic enough i do n't want to listen to cheeto fatshame him for four months
who else then anyone but a straight white male wo n’t beat him that leaves gavin newsom who has plenty to dig up including that his ex wife is dating a trump and all jb has is toilets and his waistline i selfishly want him to stay too but if he ’s our only shot
newsom is probably waiting for his chance
newsom more unpopular than biden california especially californian politics are toxic as hell to the rest of the country buttigieg i like him too but he lacks experience and i seriously doubt a gay guy can pull the center whitmer i think she 's got the best chance of those you listed wyden he 's 75 the same old age attacks are going to land on him as biden but he 's not incumbent and does n't have the campaign infrastructure other than that i wish he would i think he could do better than most in getting bipartisan bills through i think kamala has too many haters agreed she 's not as toxic as hillary but pretty close
josh shapiro could also lock up pennsylvania if on a ticket
she 's so soft leftie though can you really call yourself moderate if you 're against any support of the people
you did n’t hear about it or you personally did n’t stay home
he does not have parkinson 's reddit remains insane
he might be dead before the election
yes just read the fucking article
yes so deranged trump must be a better alternative
says who exactly president or not he 's still a human being and no one is infallible and for all that 's wrong with him he conceded he 's old as shit but he 's right far as i saw he was n't spouting lies or shit talking all night he had real answers to his topics i 'm not a fan of the giant douche vs turd sandwich bs we 've been dealt but he 's still clearly the better option for america since the dnc has committed
i think it ’s still better than the guy who rambles in hyperbole and goes on about how we had h2o and slobs every dictator knob he ’s come into contact with
the idea in his head was likely there is a lot of violence against women that is being exacerbated by abortion restriction but all they can talk about is the fact that an illegal immigrant killed a woman i am not trying to argue that it is a good answer he clearly got flustered in it and skipped over a lot of helpful context and words that would have made his answer clear i am just claiming that it is an answer badly executed rather than a non answer
yes it does i can break it down better for you if you want i am going to use parantheticals to adjust the sentences around the blocks first contextually he was answering a question about the repeal of roe v wade the immediately preceding context is that he is speaking specifically about the supreme court giving states the right to restrict abortions look there 's so many young women who have been raped including a young woman who just was murdered and he r killer went to the funeral there was an idea that she was murdered by an illegal immigrant coming in and the news only wants to talk about that but here is the deal there 's a lot of young women who are being raped by their in laws their spouses their brothers and sisters it 's just ridiculous they ca n't do anything about it and then the states try to arrest them when they cross state lines to get an abortion all the information is there he is just dropping words when he encounters speech blockers he is clearly trying to talk about the negative repercussions of allowing states to restrict abortions no abortions in cases of rape incest prosecutiong people who seek them his stutter seems to be flustering him so he just moves to the next sentence what he is saying is really clear to me but it is obvious that what he has in his head was not reaching his speech correctly but given his age and speech impediment this would not be unusual in a highly stressful environment ideally they need to debate again and biden needs to focus his coaching on taking a breath planning the sentence and only then speaking that is normally how he does it when he is asked questions by the media or in interviews he tends to get less understandable the more he tries to say at once
he did not pivot it it was two sentences then he was immediately back on topic i am like 90 % certain the point he was probably trying to hit one that was likely prepared was the trump campaign news keep focusing on one woman who was killed by an immigrant while countelss women are facing danger due to the repeal of roe if you look at the context this is pretty obviously what he means he started the answer talking about trump claiming victory over roe by allowing states to regulate it it ’s been a terrible thing what you ’ve done the fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported roe when it was decided supported roe and i was that ’s this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous and this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it we ’re in a state where in six weeks you do n’t even know whether you ’re pregnant or not but you can not see a doctor have your and have him decide on what your circumstances are whether you need help the idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying we ’re going to turn civil rights back to the states let each state have a different rule he then moves on to the consequences for women which is where he got tripped up look there ’s so many young women who have been including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral and the idea that she was murdered by by an immigrant coming in to talk about that but here ’s the deal there ’s a lot of young women who are being raped by their by their in laws by their by their spouses brothers and sisters by just it ’s just it ’s just ridiculous and they can do nothing about it and they try to arrest them when they cross state lines you can tell that he meant what i said above because of the line and the idea that she was murdered by an immigrant coming in to talk about that he hit a block in the middle of it at the word by but there is no reason for him to say the idea and to talk about that unless he is talking about what trump 's campaign is saying which is in keeping with the larger context of what he is saying everything after but here is the deal was an attempt to refute trump 's messaging which means that he was talking about how trump is treating women who have violence done against them he attempts to say that women are being raped even in incestous cirucmstances but can not get abortions in the aformentioend states he said in the first quote then they are arrested for trying to leave the state to get them so this whole section was pretty obviously supposed to be trump keeps saying immigrants are making women unsafe but women are really being made unsafe by the repeal of roe it was a solid point before it got mangled by literally at least 6 blocks a common symptom of a stutter when someone tried to talk to fast the second part of his response to the abortion questions here demonstrates that he knows what he is trying to say i supported roe v wade which had three trimesters first time is between a woman and a doctor second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation a third time is between the doctor i mean it ’d be between the woman and the state the idea that the politicians that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman ’s health is ridiculous that ’s the last no politician should be making that decision a doctor should be making those decisions that ’s how it should be run that ’s what you ’re going to do and if i ’m elected i ’m going to restore roe v wade the thing that really depresses me about all of this is that biden was clearly struggling with both his voice and his stutter last night but the message is biden brain broke even though these are all literally symptoms of the disorder he has had for a long time he is getting older and it is clearly harder for him to control it but that does not mean his brain is not working his record in office should make that much clearer than a bad night
you used the right word there disaster
four years ago we were loading bodies into trucks and this guy 's son in law said just to let it happen because it was only killing city folks
that 's absolutely not what he wants remember 4 years ago when adjusted for inflation americans had thousands of dollats more discretionary income than me he was correct not to even touch the subject
and for a president you honestly want someone like that the policy wonks are the advisors to the president
this it 's absolutely unforgiveable that his people completely ignored this and that he allowed them to
he is not an attack dog he is the family dog
all this means is that you should not be president either calmtoaster
he 's always done that remember barack america literally the day he joined obama 's campaign but yeah it was worse than usual last night i m pretty sure the big we finally defeated medicare was him just tripping up and switching out defended to avoid a stutter
right that 's what makes this whole thing worse his people got to set the rules and they were so focused on fucking trump they forgot to play to the strengths of their own guy
i feel like biden had several anecdotes that he could n’t keep straight i probably would n’t either at his age the team that prepared him tried to prep him like a young man biden needed to play to his strength stay on policy goals that do n’t alienate voters and look calm and poised while doing it do n’t grandstand do n’t empathize do n’t try to make voters fall in love your opponent is batshit crazy just let him lose voters by trying to lie and ramble do n’t engage in his tactics q what is your stance on abortion a his judges dropped the ball on roe v wade my administration and fellow democrats will fix that thank you trump rambles r and that ’s the same plan that lost your last election thank you q what are you going to do about boarder security a we tried to pass legislation but republicans repeatedly shot down our attempts for political gains next year my administration and fellow democrats will fix that trump rambles r and that ’s why you lost the popular vote last time thank you keep it short keep it simple do n’t use your whole 2 minutes the moment trump tries to call him out for lack of content hit him with the “ i ’ve been debating you for the last 4 years my administration speaks for itself my cabinet has done more for the american people than any of your golf trips racist rants or mafia style take over of an entire political party
so almost exactly what biden did
biden would n’t even need to fact check every lie just point out all the fraud charges civil charges for rape and trump ’s general moral unfitness for office
i do n’t know i think the guy who ’s speaking today would do just fine in a debate he ’s got a totally different energy about him
fuck that fatshaming jb is our thing
kamala is the only choice if the dnc picks newsome and installs him as the candidate over kamala it will splinter the voter base since it ’s going to be her the best plan is just to stick with biden since she ’ll take over if he becomes seriously too old or dies anyways biden beat trump once before now trump is a felon instigated jan 6 was found liable for sexual assault has more pending criminal trials and roe v wade has led to dem over performance
newsome is polling better than biden in swing states
you did n’t mention schiff but i do n’t think a meaningful number of people who would have voted for biden would refuse to vote for any of these people
wyden is a young and spry 75 year old compared to trump though
the fact that you need to speculate on what was going on in his head is the giveaway that he was absolutely awful at getting his point across we are now at the stage where we are making up excuses about what he did or did not mean the same way trump supporters do about the awful things he says just be honest about it he was far worse than anyone expected and no amount of gaslighting will change that i fucking hate even using the term gaslighting but this is literally what all of this is
removing the stutter does n't mean i get to interpret what he was saying and insert whatever words i want when he awkwardly does n't end a sentence he literally did n't say abortion once like i agree with you that he probably was trying to say lots of women get raped and get pregnant from that and are being forced to carry those fetuses now because of backwards laws the fact is that he did n't say that i do n't care what he meant because what he said was not only incoherent but did n't actually address the question
i did n’t get that from him your additions make more sense but claiming it ’s “ clear ” is kind of a stretch
listen i ’m aware of what he was probably trying to say and i emphasize probably because you could also just interpret what you ’re getting out of that to mean something different and i ’m willing to look past that my choice of the word “ pivot ” was the wrong choice of word for what he did but none of that changes that bringing up immigration in any way shape or form in the greater context of this debate was one of the dumbest fucking things he could ’ve done considering his opponent just fucking loves talking about dangerous illegal immigrants and that ’s his bread and butter with his dumb ass crowd that he could not make the connection of “ let me not bring up abortion and immigration in the same paragraph ” when he could ’ve significantly simplified it by saying “ women have a right to their bodies ” and that ’s all his audience wanted him to say shows that he is a doddering old man who has a complete lack of awareness of what his constituency is looking for and the pairing of ideas that only makes his fascist opponent look good is what makes him come across as incoherent and if you have to go through so much effort to break down the paragraph of his transcript sentence by sentence to give it some kind of meaning to explain why what he said was actually a good thing shows how awful his argument was to begin with
yes “ beat medicare ” is clearly just a stutter and not an insane thing to say
your interpretation does n't negate the fact people heard what he said not what you wished he said or what you think he meant they heard his incoherent rambling live and in person the 50 million people who watched the debate last night do n't give a fuck about thoughts or feelings they saw what they saw
“ by the way his son in law made 2 billion dollars from the saudi ’s after he left office what for ”
then for the next 4 years we killed 2x as many people because i decided covid was over but it 's cool we 're the good guys
yes but the dem campaign apparatus being full of wonks who like other wonks is pretty much convinced that 's what everyone wants
yeah well i 'm just saying i 'd rather vote for someone who has greater inner strength than outer strength trump might appear stronger on the outside but he 's weak inside but still we should have a leader that can articulate their thoughts no matter the situation
i m pretty sure the big we finally defeated medicare was him just tripping up and switching out defended to avoid a stutter it just sounded like he conflated two different thoughts sentences he was talking about covid right before that so his brain got mixed up with beat covid and trying to say something about medicare
stay on policy goals that do n’t alienate voters and look calm and poised while doing it 100 %
part of the art of writing talking points is to capture the ' spirit ' of the speaker d
he did not say abortion but he did say roe twice pregnant once and referred directly to abortion via responding in context to the question 6 times in his answer the part that keeps getting reposted is literally less then half of his answer and it is being cherry picked as a particularly difficult part to understand especially when you take it without the surrounding context referring to abortion as it only makes sense when you read the question and answer in sequence but it does make sense and he was answering a question about it in sequence if you go a step farther and look at the second part of his answer after trump 's turn at rebuttal he is extremely clear i supported roe v wade which had three trimesters first time is between a woman and a doctor second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation a third time is between the doctor i mean it ’d be between the woman and the state the idea that the politicians that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman ’s health is ridiculous that ’s the last no politician should be making that decision a doctor should be making those decisions that ’s how it should be run that ’s what you ’re going to do and if i ’m elected i ’m going to restore roe v wade
it makes a lot more sense in context which people are constantly omitting this segment is the hardest to understand thing he said but the stuff he said before and after and the connection to the question made it fairly obvious to me what he meant that is not saying it was not a terrible answer honestly even if it did not have half a dozen blocking events it would be a pretty weak response but i feel like people are cherry picking the worst possible moments and refusing to give him any benefit of the doubt whatsoever
by the way my son made hundreds of millions of dollars in art when it was his first try they both do n't have good families
no one is saying they are voting for trump over biden that is asking biden to leave we are worried about the 100 000 people in mn mi wi pa that are going to do this we also would prefer to have a better president provided to us by the democratic party which we would almost certainly get if he were to resign and end his campaign
i watched it live by context do you mean like the various news stories and background i would have needed to bring to the table and then fill in all the blanks with that if so i think that really underscores how badly he let everyone down w this debate most people do n’t follow news that closely especially not in a way that lets them easily connect all those dots he needed to be a dot connector instead he just gave us dots and not even all the dots i appreciate you filling in some stuff though
potato potahto 99 % of americans could n’t tell the difference which one of them did 9 11 and which one did 10 7 again they ’re both petrostate sponsors of terrorism either one is a bad look to be taking bribes from
yeah that ’s the same thing
we are just preaching to the choir at this point dude
it 's actually aborted fourth trimester babies committing most of these crimes
blaming outsiders is a common tactic to encourage cohesion you are n’t going to easily convince someone who ’s already convinced that immigrants are the cause of our problems of anything different
they know that but it works on who they want it to work on every dobbs roe countered with every border illegals migrant caravan think about it
there is a direct link between crime rates and poverty levels there is also a link between poverty levels and ta cuts for the wealthy
i assume it 's my relatives fueling it
can someone post the article text in the thread
no serious person thinks that and also immigrants do hard work lazy americans have given up doing wild income inequality is the issue it ’s flaunted on social media by people seen by all then prompts theft
the fact that this even need to be a headline just makes me even more pissed off about the debate of course this is n't true ugh are we in a simulation
nyc is pretty fucked up now as my observation filled with illegal immigrant beggars and vagrants every block they come up to peoples doors and shit in queens it ’s honestly a huge nuisance that is top of the political topics for us now
this is an incredibly ignorant take seeing as how many stories were seeing of just horrendous crimes being committed by people who should n't be here
even one crime is too many the cost of illegals is extremely high both financially and to everyone ’s safety if they want to increase the population why not save the middle class instead
idk if bloomberg knows this or not but 100 % of all illegal immigrants are law breaking criminals
i ’ve seen plenty of videos on social media of illegal aliens committing crimes but it literally nothing compared to what black people do on a daily basis 9 out of 10 crimes posted on ring in my area are black people nyc subway crime 9 out of 10 black perp i ’m almost thinking the dems were spot on labeling black people super predators back in the 90 ’s
exactly spelling it out always helps we ’re all learning
it 's also tough because the optics just are n't great the rhetoric of well they are illegal they did n't come lawfully is enough to make even plenty of people who would otherwise oppose blatant othering to feel like it 's just common sense to get mad at illegal immigrants the whole illegals are less likely to commit crime statistic also sounds irrational at first glance since one can say they are all criminals by definition but the stat is about them being less likely to commit crimes once here there 's also the stuff with republican governors busing migrants to blue cities which is bad policy but has been exceptionally effective with optics given how many blue areas have reacted negatively to it and the main real issue there is that we do n't let migrants work as soon as they get here to support themselves so federal policy unnecessarily makes them a burden that they do n't need to be plus the whole asylum spamming thing can have bad optics too immigration even mass illegal immigration is n't actually hurting us but it 's way more complicated and difficult to argue for than to take the anti immigrant stance
exactly spelling it out always helps we ’re all learning i think 8th grade level
conservatives are n’t going to do anything about it anyway because ultimately they work for the corporations that benefit from hiring migrants for poverty wages it ’s better for business to just let the problem continue and then they can also turn around and blame the left to rile people up during the next election cycle
i know what you ’re saying and the rest of this does n’t apply to your observation i do n’t think because your link is accurate what research has shown is that immigrants have historically committed crime at rates far lower than similarly situated american born people going back over a century so even poor immigrants are less likely to be criminals than equally poor americans this is ground we covered in 2016 and 2020 but it seems to be a durable falsehood for people who want to believe the worst about immigrants whether illegal or not so while the economic piece is certainly correct when you add in the immigration element the relationship is less straightforward
just curious how you know they 're illegal i 've seen plenty of beggars and vagrants never checked their citizenship
this should be a top rated comment it ’s insane
attention grabbing stories are n’t actual data though they are data points in a larger picture that the media is n’t necessarily interested in telling
if every crime committed by any other group was presented on youtube the news i would suppose that the i e would pale in comparison plenty of black crime shown plenty of white citizens doing shit but propaganda about the other is hot right now see also tesla cars electric vehicles are shit and so are the drivers
believe i 'd rather live next door to an illegal immigrant than a republican
they come to a border and apply for asylum becoming pretty much legal asylum seekers then they are either granted asylum which later can be converted to lrp status and citizenship or deported in what way are they criminals
yeah he stumbled a lot and had a really bad debate big difference between that and a convicted criminal rapist who blatantly lies and spreads hate racism and christian nationalism
but the illegal migrants are taking all the “ black ” jobs
do you lock the door to your home or do you leave it open and let everybody that wants to walk into your home
yup has worked every single time without fail since 2016 for them i know who they 're targeting you know who they 're targeting we all know who it works on who it 's intended to scare they 're not dumb enough to surely think their position on abortion is n't poisonous so their counter simple
i ’m guessing you do n’t live in a major city
well you seem very pleasant
because they do n’t meet the conditions for asylum and they and you know it each deportation officer has to track like 7 000 cases now and growing everyday
if you want to come to the country legally you go to a port of entry and apply those folks would not be considered illegal immigrants as they are granted entry if you illegally enter the usa you committed a criminal act
that argument is on the same tier as if i am expected to balance my checkbook the government should n't have deficits
oh i did n't realize that in major cities illegals looked different than citizens or are they given an arm band can you clarify maybe we bumpkins can learn how to better identify illegals on sight
ok so you have no idea what ’s actually going on at least try to understand what people who are voting are going through instead of trying to extract some terminally online “ gotcha ” the ignorance you are displaying is profound
i actually do live near a major city you just have n't said how to identify an illegal on sight how do you do it other than just assuming every latino is illegal you must have a strategy
if you thought 6 3 scotus decisions suck wait until they ’re 7 2 and 8 1 decisions
from semafor 's david weigel vermont sen bernie sanders rejected calls for joe biden to end his presidential campaign on friday telling semafor that thursday ’s debate had gone poorly but there was time to retool “ he ’s not a great debater he ’s not necessarily a great speaker ” sanders said “ people are just gon na have to say okay you know what yeah he ’s old yeah he ’s not as articulate as he should be but you ’re voting for somebody whose policies will impact your life ” asked about the new york times ’s editorial board urging biden to quit and whether a different nominee could win the election he refused to speculate biden needed to get more specific about how he ’d “ improve the lives of working people ” not step down “ biden is the candidate ” he said “ i suspect he will be the candidate i ’ll do my best to get him elected ”
trump literally told lies better than biden telling the truth so because trump can quickly lie i should pull my support for biden is just stupid yes biden should be retired and relaxing somewhere but instead he is the president running for a second term because trump is the candidate for the republican party oh you bet biden is gon na win if democratic voters get out and vote
stupidest decision ever you just had to ignore the orange pig for a few months and let him implode in legal issues now they gave him a platform and he is back in people ’s minds as a possible candidate what a mess
honestly the messaging needs to be about trump and how dangerous he is biden is not perfect that ’s fine maybe you like him maybe you think there could be much better candidates that ’s probably true but those other people are not in the ballot trump is the alternative to biden trump is fascist and racist and wants to end democracy in america his handlers have a plan to fill thousands of government jobs with loyalists that will systematically dismantle the country you do n’t even need to mention biden by name just communicate how dangerous trump is and get people to vote
biden can win he 's running against a notorious loser his biggest threat is low turnout the democratic party can bolster that by coalescing around legal abortions and marijuana it 's as easy as that
if american public truly believe that bombastic bravado boasting and lying loudly is what strength really is then fuck it we deserve the hell that 's to come with trumps 2nd term
he could win but it ’s not looking good
hubris hubris from biden running again after the implicit message that he was a transitional leader for a new generation hubris from biden 's closest advisors supporting this decision and to debate in his condition hubris from this entire white house that this was n't an unmitigated fucking disaster and he wants to debate fucking again fucking hell these people should not be running the country scotus is going to be conservative now forever we 're fucking an entire generation
if trump loses does he run again in 4 years or if he loses will the justice system catch up to and consume him
we better load up on water now before trump pollutes it all
bernie why you got ta be a dick like that bro
this is coping he did horrible
it ’s was n’t super likely before the debates and it ’s less likely now anyone thinking biden has an advantage or has the better shot at beating trump is just playing into trumps hands at this point as biden is exactly the candidate trump wants to face
fuck i wish this country was ready to elect bernie
really starting to think democrats secretly want fascism at this rate
after the other night bernie ’s looking young bernie 2032
the things that always stand out to people and get the most media coverage are the flubs misses and low points all anyone has been talking about is biden 's obvious feebleness and inability to energetically get his points across for trump the most coverage seems to be his comments about black jobs and aborting babies after being given birth to that 's how it is back in 2016 there was a lot more confidence in hillary 's ability to win at this point in the race than we have currently with biden nobody was talking about the need to replace hillary with a completely different candidate 4 months out
yes he can effing win stop booing the home team it ’s the fourth quarter and the democratic party is on the ropes despite a solid first term
they need a stronger palestinian
if biden is the nominee trump will win deal with reality
bernie the bernie that just ran to be in senate until he 's 88 years old
i resent the excuses being made because president biden is very clearly not fine but if enough people are convinced that he is based on the words of other politicians the public 's ability to make decisions based on facts will be taken away i 'm disappointed in bernie he does n't trust us to make our own decisions no one should want to be governed by unelected aides and cabinet members because president biden is n't capable of the task
i doubt it bernie is being to nice biden was barely able twitter hold to about a 50 50 chance of winning the election his debate performance will hurt him not by people voting for trump but staying home i would not be shocked if we start seeing trumps chances increase significantly meanwhile the democratic party will double down on biden alienating voters
tow the party line what can you do until biden wokes up to the reality everyone sorta have to support him
stupid encouraging your candidate to debate someone who is constitutionally prohibited from holding office democrats ' only reply to trump 's debate talk should have been president joe biden is running unopposed because the republican candidate is a seditionist and prohibited from holding office and we appreciate that republicans support vice president harris ' constitutional power to decide which votes will be counted in 2024 fucking stupid criticizing your candidate after they stupidly agree to debate this is n't biden 's fault he was simply being himself an ancient man who looks like a wax dummy brought to life this is the fault of democrat voters who insisted on making a candidate out of a 80 year old ' 90s style politician
nope he needs to step down from the presidency
reminder if bernie had never run for president on a ridiculous platform of pandering free shit and monkey wrenched everything in 2016 trump would have never won this is completely bernie ’s fault and he needs to own it
bernie backs biden despite copious evidence showing biden 's incompetence and inability to lead due to dementia and age wow whoda thunk eh
obergefell delete lawrence delete comstock act enact that 's what the court looks like in a second trump term basically roe was just the first domino to fall obviously
trump is going to be the most consequential president in atleast half a century if that happens his picks will define the court for decades to come insane
well it turns out there 's a consequence of lifetime appointments and because of that i assume the founding fathers were smart enough to think about that situation
they already have a majority it wo n’t change anything right now but it will make that majority last much longer when you have to replace 4 to have a majority rather than just 2
do n't threaten me with the supreme court
good maybe that ’s what we need to wake people up s
he ’s giving the average american too much credit that they ’ll actually understand this
bernie is older than biden makes sense that he would n't be predisposed to being very critical on the age issue
that ’s all well and good but can he be voted for if dead or in a vegetative state 3 months seems like a lifetime from now hehe he is declining at a rapid pace and even if he makes it he ’ll be in such bad shape it will affect the vote which is unfortunate realistically what ’s his timeline 6 months can anyone imagine him still being here in a year without life support or in end of life care i ca n’t
you should place your support behind a candidate that can meaningfully combat the lies and who does n’t immediately crumble not to mention that performance was after prepping at camp david for an entire week
biden will win the popular vote if democrats get out and vote he will lose the electoral college biden needs independents to win
trump was winning almost every swing state before this debate ignoring him did nt help the legal issues did nt help the stupid decision was biden running for a second term
trump is kicking biden ’s shit in across swing states my guy nationally trump is 2 0 over biden that ’s a 10 point swing from 2020 at this point in the cycle if biden does nothing he loses you do realize that was clinton ’s 2016 strategy right this is going to be 2016 all over again is n’t it
messaging is n't going to fix biden 's debate performance it 's hard to sell casual voters on the idea that this election this one is vital to our democracy when the guy running against him stares off into space and loses the plot mid sentence if the situation is serious and it is we need a stronger candidate
yeah i do n't think very many people were pro biden even before this debate anti trump on the other hand i 've seen a hell of a lot of that i 'll also say that biden 's administration is mostly competent and generally doing good for the country which is a bonus it 's far better than the actively harmful for the country we got in trump 's first term and the end of american democracy he 's promised for a second
biden literally pivoted a debate question about abortion into illegal immigration for some reason i do n’t think he can take us where we need to go
pretending biden can win at this rate is a fatal mistake i d love to be wrong but in november i wo nt be
well that is what we ’re going to get because democrats wo n’t play the game
if he wins it 's the rust belt that does it if he does that is i do n't think it 's a great shot but i 'd take 40 45 % over 0 % which is what the media suggestions are giving us based on objective hardcore poll evidence to the contrary
he ca n’t win we have to stop with the rationalization
the most frustrating part is that the exact same thing happened in 2016 there were a ton of warning signs yet the democrats ignored them all and acted like clinton getting elected was a formality
did you listen to his post debate speech last night or his rally speech today in nc have you listened to any interviews with him over the past few months howard stern conan obrien and seth meyers were all long form interviews did you watch his sotu speech a few months ago or are you basing everything on just last night
i do n't think he 'll make it another 4 years whether or not he wins in november
trump 's probably done if he does much smarter much sharper fascists waiting in the wings to in their minds do what he could not in the long term if so either trump becomes the king possibly lifelong dictator of the us now or does not is what is likely at stake but it does not eliminate the threat on its own just saves it from spreading and gives time to form a real solution for 4 more years which might be enough to curtail its progress i can see greg abbott tx gov salivating at the thought in particular very obvious he only declined the vp slot because he wants a resounding victory if he runs for potus as he always wins every race he wins by landslide margins in his state to date nikki haley and ron desantis are out due to challenging trump failing in 2024 meanwhile which to his base showed extreme disloyalty which wo n't be forgiven easily to me greg 's loyalty will pay off in the long term for him in his mind ted cruz ca n't do it now his chance was 2016 but while he 's still liked in his state his national standing 's bad
this is cult behavior no one can be that
he ’s still a politician maybe relax on the “ too pure for this world ” stuff
we 're not booing the home team we 're booing the 48 year old quarterback that ca n't stop throwing interceptions when we have a young draft pick that was a stud in college because we want the home team to win
only if you want that to be the reality voters have a choice if they want trump or biden assuming biden stays in then biden could very easily win unless voters decide they want trump
still sharp as a tack highly competent adored by his constituents and many democrats in general age is only a problem when it ’s a problem it ’s not with bernie
it 's more like he knows that he will not win over the ex gop white voters biden has in the dem corner right now and will scare off the billionaires that are giving biden coh re sanders bernie gets how grim the situation is really
he does n't trust us to make our own decisions americans elected trump in 2016 and are seriously considering doing it again even though he is a literal criminal now all of the evidence suggests bernie is right not to trust us
unfortunately that would n't fix anything because kamala harris is unelectable the democrats put themselves in a terrible position but i think they have a better chance of getting out of it by having biden announce he 's ending his reelection bid and nominating someone like wes moore or whitmer than they do by staying the course with biden harris
he can probably finish his term but i do n't think he should be running for another one
whatever gets you through the night lol
this must be satire reminder if progressives lose it ’s because their polices are n’t liked by the electorate if centrist lose it ’s because the progressives caused it the centrists can do no wrong
yep and i also think bernie is how we got here with biden to avoid running an overt socialist against a repub incumbent in 2020 we had to have several of the best dem candidates fall on their swords and endorse biden at super tuesday we could have chosen a younger nominee if we ’d had more time to let the process play out but we had to do something to fend off bernie bernie bros never got that some of his big promises just are n’t that popular
that 's just in the next few years if he wins it 'll be like that for decades
actually when you look at the intent of the constitution the founding fathers were very specifically trying to mandate a monarchy trump brand supreme court probably
frankly i thought roe would have created a big wave from the left but hey it ’s all fine the us is embracing the warm pillowy feeling of christofascism
and because of that i assume the founding fathers were smart enough to think about that situation yeah its called kicking the can down the road if there 's one thing they truly did n't expect it was the feverish cult of traditionalism surrounding their own work every time you read any founding father talk about the constitution especially on why they did n't do x or y even when they recognized it was an obvious near or far future problem it goes like this because we 've made the systems to change it when it needs to be changed and we did n't want to force future generations to suffer under the tyranny of our own assumptions the constitution was never meant to be some kind of holy document of freedom and democracy it was meant to be a living thing that changes with the times and the cult of american exceptionalism ruined it
tends to happen when all of the founding fathers were rich landowning white men that created the constitution to protect their own power and wealth
there are two types of conservatives on the court currently roberts gorsuch and barrett are more moderate thomas alito and kavanaugh are more extreme republicans will pressure alito and thomas to resign because they are old sotomayor is likewise older and kagan ai n’t that much younger trump would secure the 6 3 majority for another decade he could secure a 7 2 or 8 1 majority that would mean there would be 5 more extreme conservatives roberts who already struggles to reign in the court would be powerless until now he ’s been able to sometimes convince gorsuch or barrett in joining him with the liberal judges that wo n’t be enough everything would be on the table we would likely never see a liberal court in our lifetimes
perhaps his greatest flaw is his respect for the people he governs i still take it over treating his electorate like dirt as most politicians do
is the average american a swing voter
exactly why bernie could n’t win before he ’s far too policy oriented it goes over people ’s heads
and about 10 times more articulate unfortunately i would kill for biden to have half the energy bernie does in the debate
bernie is older than biden makes sense that he would n't be predisposed to being very critical on the age issue bernie is 1 year older than biden biden is 3 years older than trump they are all in the same age group this criticism about biden 's age is bullshit considering that the convicted felon 's cognitive functionating issues were displayed via the nonsensical and delusional claims he made in last night 's debate trump so i want absolutely immaculate clean water and i want absolutely clean air and we had it we had h2o we had the best numbers ever
bernie has been rock solid and consistent in his stances and demeanor since he was a young man his age is irrelevant
age is n’t exactly indicative of decline but joe last night sure showed he ’s in serious decline
biden arguably over prepared he tried to memorize too many facts and in the high pressure environment ended up with a word salad should have been better but joe ’s always been awkward af
i place my support for anyone who is n’t trump i will not be gaslighted on this anyone not trump
insane to me that people do n’t see this we are actively telling the country that this is the most important election and our candidate does not look like one likely to make it through an entire term
that 's basically how i explained it to my nephew and his friends who are all going to be first time voters in this election you 're not voting for biden or trump you 're voting for their respective cabinets political appointees judges and vice president picks people that old both of them sometimes die it happens and would n't be the first time in american history i ca n't help but wonder if biden might be able to bolster his flagging image by replacing kamala harris instead of stepping down frame it instead as sure i 'm old but who cares would just take over for me and do a great job jack so cut the malarkey
if only people voted based on a rational assessment of the reality you just summarized hell if only people voted i should n't be this nervous going into an election where an obvious fascist psychopath is one of the two choices any alternative is better
my concern is imagine if you 're someone who does n't know really anything about politics and you assume the president is the guy making all the decisions you want to make the best decision for your country are you going to pick a questionable guy who seems mostly there or a guy who you can barely understand who seems to have dementia i assume those are the people who will decide this election and that 's probably what 's in their mind
fair point those two are n't in his wheelhouse but they need to be
if they do n't make the platform more attractive you 're probably right they certainly ca n't keep hammering on the dangers of trump and not really doing anything to stop or reverse things he 's done
objective hardcore poll evidence what platitudes you can not expect a poll to be an accurate representation of what voters will do when they have n't digested the candidate any candidate that is replaced would have several months to increase their numbers several factors also hurt candidates that are n't even being considered in polls name recognition media exposure perceived fit for office etc so many people have framed this election of why does it have to be these two a new candidate could energize voters who were planning on staying home they get to separate themselves from unpopular biden policies that biden himself can not back away from politically it allows those who are mad about palestine an excuse to come back into the fold this idea that changing the candidate at such a late time is suicide is not based on anything it 's never happened before 1968 is probably the closest thing and although humphrey lost it is unlikely that johnson would have won in about two weeks we will have a better view of what the election looks like debates historically do n't move the polls very much but last night 's performance was not a normal bad debate performance
it 's not completely impossible but i would n't want to bet the country on it
i think he can if he picks a different vp someone that people can get behind to take over if needed
bernie thinks he can win do you think you know biden better than bernie knows him
this is spot on 2016 was the first election i could vote in and i was very engaged i remember my college profs and journalists acting like trump was just a joke like it was funny that he was running and that he was n't a serious candidate despite his fast rise to power and alarming popularity it was unprecedented etc and i bought into the falsehood that they could n't have foreseen trump actually winning i thought we all learned from that but and they are letting the same thing happen again and this time it 's even more blatant
yes did you fucking watch the debate last night there are bad performances and then whatever the fuck that was last night about murdering medicare
no one who is n't a democrat watched his rally the undecided voters who does n't follow politics did n't see his sotu speech people watched the debate and those who did n't will definitely hear about bidens mental health issues from somewhere else this is frontpage news across the world it is also very likely that biden will just get worse and have more bad days moving forward
with all the cult behavior resistance libs are currently displaying on twitter and reddit re biden rn bernie fans can be a little nostalgic for their guy as a great
yes you are he is the quarterback that is not changing i hope you do n’t regret running down our best choice when they are throwing liberals in camps or killing their political enemies
voters do n’t want trump but they ’re not voting for biden either refusing to give people something to actually stand for and support is not a winning strategy
i 'm hoping behind the scenes discussions are going on to persuade them both to bow out so far the statements coming out have been ambiguous yeah it was bad but he 's done these things could be pivoted to cover biden either staying in or dropping out harris does have an electability problem i 'm hoping she 's aware of that and is willing to trade her quiet departure for some other position
the math does n’t lie i would n’t expect reddit to understand
bernie bros never got that some of his big promises just are n’t that popular to avoid running an overt socialist against a repub incumbent in 2020 we had to have several of the best dem candidates fall on their swords and endorse biden at super tuesday well this happened because his promises were too popular sooo
yep glad at least one other person here gets it
that 'll be the trump supreme court with big gaudy gold letters on the front
chevron has already been deleted do n't need a second trump term for that
i thought more women would be seriously bothered by it and while some certainly are you still see enough woman voting republican that these races are super close i guess reading about life before roe is n’t the same as experiencing it unfortunately today ’s women people need to experience the cruelty the suffering and the death before the movement becomes loud again
they were of a different time and back then they may not have considered certain things as reprehensible as we do today i agree we need to have a modern discussion about the laws and constitution that we might hold dear but until that can happen which frankly seems more distant than ever before we have to consider the framework of what we have and what is currently in place
what tends to happen there 's a possible solution written in the bill of rights
probably also part of why he still seems to have integrity compared to many politicians if you have no respect for those you represent it 's easier to just serve yourself first
no but the average american is apathetic about politics and focuses more on the charisma of the candidate rather than their policies or cabinet
and it 's honestly why the right so often wins on stupid things because they appeal to emotion while the left is less emotional and more about policies
trump 's base ate his insane ramblings up i blocked a magat trying to tell me how eloquently and coherently trump spoke last night moderates apparently thought he was nuts so that 's a positive
the criticism of his age is not bullshit it is completely valid and all the gaslighting like this being done on it is part of the problem they ’re both too damn old
regular people do n't think trump has cognitive functioning issues despite everything trump still leads in the polls even as a convicted felon i do n't think regular people are correct just as i do n't think they are correct about the idea that the economy is doing terrible but regular people are what decides the elections and regardless of whether biden is really too old he 's perceived as being disastrously old and the debate cemented it he 's got ta go if we want to beat trump it 's that simple
those and age are just numbers and we all agree that they are not meaningfully comparable between individuals it ’s obvious right right good now stop with the nonsense
bernie ’s sharp a a tack still will probably be that way right up to the end
because trump says it with conviction after a lifetime of blustering and lying to cover up his own idiocy on the surface he makes the insane things he ’s saying sound normal
why did they let him debate there is no way they prepped with him and thought he was good to go
this has been my exact same thought process he momorized all his zingers and talking points instead of just being joe because he had to memorize he tripped over himself and caused his stutter to come out
i ’m sorry i just do n’t buy that it was just stumbling over words at this point he a democratic candidate brought up crime from illegal immigrants during a question about abortion he took a question about his strongest issue and shifted focus onto his weakest issue there are so many angles to go after trump from that any competent debater should have used biden from any other past debate would have smoked donald trump even debate 2020 biden which was n’t really considered a fantastic performance at the time looks amazing compared to what we saw last night never mind 2008 or 2012 biden that guy is seriously like a different person altogether
i place my support for anyone who is n’t trump you should place your support behind someone who can actually beat trump even if you vite for biden anyway you cam do both things it is n't hard
yes trump should not be president we should pick a stronger candidate so he does n’t win
it ’s kind of sad that we ’re defending a presidential candidate by saying “ but their administration will be good ” though i mean who the hell is even running the country at this point anyone who follows this closely and watched last night knows that biden could n’t manage a gas station utterly shambolic by the democratic party to not offer up a better candidate
i agree why ca n’t he pick a new vp and tell people he will stay on for one more transition year then so and so becomes president is that even allowed
it 's unlikely that any prominent leader in the democratic party is going to openly call for biden to resign at this point if they were to do that and biden does not step down and is n't removed then they will have just undermined the democratic nominee for nothing i think they 're waiting to see how this plays out how the people react what the post debate polls say they 're also giving biden time to voluntarily decide to step down which would be the smoothest possible transition bernie may honestly believe that biden is still the best candidate but given what 's at stake i do n't think he 's going to deviate from the standard script even if he is privately hoping for biden to drop out it 's just too early for that if biden does need to drop out though he 'd better not put it off too long
i can evaluate the situation more effectively apparently
okay the medicare thing was a slip up he was obviously trying to say we beat covid i mean we solved the medicare problem i mean we beat the problems that covid caused for medicaire patients by making it better
or maybe everyone as a whole just needs to stop worshipping politicians like they ’re idols they ’re people we elect to do a job not heroes
how about we do n't do either tbh re what sanders said on he should have been loud and clear in telling the american people that he was the first president in american history ever to walk on a picket line ” i agree with him there surprised biden did n't he should in the next debate
i hope so too but i doubt it 'll happen right now the most likely outcome is the democratic leadership continuing to double down on biden harris then acting shocked when they lose the white house just like in 2016
what i mean is they created a system that is designed to keep the wealthy in power and to protect their property its why we do n't actually elect the president it 's why the house of representatives which is supposed to represent the people has the shortest term in office while the senate has the longest term in office and originally was n't elected by the people and why the supreme court is n't elected by the people but is nominated by the president that the people do n't directly elect and approved by the senate which was created to control the house of representatives it 's not a coincidence that the rich overwhelming support the conservatives and why the conservative supreme court is giving the rich back power by allowing them to legally bribe politicians and buy elections
if everyone in congress gave as much of a shit about the american people as he does we would be decades ahead of where we are now
lots of assumptions and speculation here
the unfortunate thing you 're going to learn is that you can block magats on reddit but you ca n't block their votes at the polls and many more care about the style in a debate than the substance
speaking as a strongly left leaning person who identifies with no specific party trump was way more articulate than he has been lately in that debate and frankly more articulate than biden he was spewing bullshit but he was doing so more coherently than we 've seen him in years
i do n’t know the conviction thing has really sank in and with sentencing a few days before the crazy shitshow that will be the republican convention that might change the story about biden ’s debate performance because that ’s when people will really start to pay attention
they should have had alarm bells when he walked onto stage and waved to the crowd in an empty room
i do n't know honestly since obama the democratic party has had some of the most extreme hubris i 've ever seen
it ’s almost like he answers with nuance it ’s easier to speak in absolute terms like trump but biden speaking to the intersection of two issues that speak plain trumps contradictions is n’t wrong it just is n’t a slam dunk and he bumbled it bad
if the dnc decides to pivot from biden then i ’m sure op will support them too
given biden is the person who actually beat trump
oh i do n't disagree with a word you said it should never have reached this point for the democrats everyone knew trump would run again so long as he was able and they had for years to uplift one of their fold the problem is twofold firstly anyone they picked would anger a different faction all the rising stars had help rising and in turn spurned others furthermore the party is basically everyone who is n't a republican at this point hard to get a consensus amongst so many people who are only a coalition because they lack viable alternatives to begin with secondly the people who have a vested interest in biden i am on the record as saying i got strong nancy reagan vibes from jill biden the moment i layed eyes on her to be clear not her as a person but instead her position in reference to the presidency next just like reagan 's administration there 's a lot of gain to be had from influencing a president whose cognitive abilities may well be questionable not even for nefarious purpose an altogether biden may say no to your bleeding heart preservation project but this one might not kind of like c montgomery burns after he 's been huffing his ether
does n’t matter not trump anything but trump we are saving an attack on our entire system of government do you want to live in russia if not reject trump he wants to be like putin now is not the time to nitpick the democratic choice
after all bernie thought bernie could win
no wonder your president has to be an actor he 's got ta look good on television doc brown called it back in 1985
which is funny because they plan to do everything in their power to block blue votes they 've outright said so
trump was convicted a month ago if it has n’t sunk in now it ’s not going to
i believe staffers and such were present in the room still there just were n’t voters in the audience
that sort of attitude will lead to trump winning “ lalalala you should agree with the majority unless you want the world and universe to end ” stop silencing and guilt tripping people and face the facts that the dnc is sending a senile old man to duke it out against trump
if the executive branch is immune i guess they can round up the justices of the supreme court and make vacancies
dear double haters most of you will outlive trump and biden but will you outlive their scotus appointments
a carve out of immunity for trumps j6 actions
something tells me they do nt need him now with the overturning of chevron and the complete consolidation of power to the sc they can slit this assholes throat and continue to just change the course of power and history through hearing ridiculous cases and setting new precedents
i ’m assuming this rules out the worst case scenario i e declaring trump immune from prosecution if he manages to win the race
they will of course confirm that he is not immune but the damage has been done now well done trump has somehow managed to dodge any meaningful convictions before the election all we have is the stupid porn star stuff
so they 've saved the biggest turd for last they do love the attention and power no wonder they drop all their work on the last day they are on the job
if you are wondering what they will do just think of who is showering scotus with lavish gifts and trips to get their way what would the billionaires want the ruling to be
even if he ends up in jail he still wins complexion matches the jumpsuit
if they drop this decision that says that at 11 am monday by noon biden should go on national tv and announce some action now that the court has granted him unlimited and unilateral power to do whatever he wants
they 'll narrow it so only trump is immune somehow while referencing some work from like the holy roman empire in 1524 or some shit to make the main point
you think these people have the mental capacity to adequately evaluate the consequences of their actions
would n't put it past them they 'll rule presidents do n't have immunity except trump as it pertains to checks notes anything he has done or ever will do
was a fantastic speech they should let grandpa joe take a nap next time this is what i wanted to see last night his humor and humility was very endearing when you fumble the football you do n't concede the game edited changed a word on brain fart writing
where was this energy last night
and when you fall down you get back up again
where tf was this guy yesterday
bummed i did n’t get to go today was going to take my youngest kid but was afraid it would n’t be finished in time to pick my other kid up glad the president is feeling better today
too bad there are not 51 million people tuning into this unlike last night
president biden is good at all the things a president is suppose to do presidents do n’t debate that is what candidates do and biden has never been a good candidate but when he is doing the president job he is good
i needed to see this thank you op
all of you claiming he 's doing so much better because of a teleprompter you 'll notice he is looking around when he speaks he is not staring into a teleprompter and even if there is one he 's not reading
oh this explains his debate he used a lot of pieces from this speech during his debate he seemed to have relied on the practice of this speech to use during the debate rather than just debating organically it makes a lot more sense now he was pulling matching pieces out of the speech from memory and it was a mess in the debate format that was unfortunate but it at least makes much more sense now it was a bad play it might have been better if he did this speech first and then had the debate a few days later
can you imagine if this biden showed up yesterday everyone would be talking about how great he was instead of telling him to stand down this just shows that you ca n’t judge a candidate by a single night
when you ’re in cognitive decline you have your good days and bad days 1 debate day was definitely a bad day 2 the day after good day as you get older you start to have more bad days than good what ’s biden going to be like in 2 3 years
debating is such a needless skill too a president will never need to debate debates are pointless
ca nt believe how lucky trump is
this energetic passionate and coherent speech is a disaster for the dems if he followed up the debate with another mumbling mess the situation would be simpler ditch biden or lose to trump but the raleigh speech was good enough to make it almost impossible to shift him while the debate convinced the sleeping masses not to vote for him in the general
everyone who watched the debate needs to watch this really hoping this calms everybody down
i like joe biden he will put the best interests of the american people above his own ego you can not say that about the other guy
a little bit late for that swing voters usually do n't see this they did see him looking partially dead on the debate either he brings up his a game for the next debate or just make sure the moving company is ready to take his shit out next year
nothing about project 2025 campaign reform or ending wwiii before it starts we 're gon na stand up for the right to vote we 're standing for medicare and social security every election this is a talking point how come dems can not secure this oh the pugs if half the people that use this excuse worked for me they would be blown out so bad they would be afraid to leave the house for year wtf gon na git lgbtq and abortion back after the dems let the pugs take them
biden does n’t drink smoke etc they probably gave him too strong of some meds and messed him up retry in sept sir
people are still calling for him to step down and it wo n’t stop you can not win when that is happening
i do n’t care how good the speech was the vast majority of undecided voters that watched the train wreck of the debate last night will never see this speech the damage is done the ship has sailed whatever other metaphor for “ time to move on ”
i 'm no doctor but is n't someone being coherent and well spoken during the day and becoming confused and unfocused the longer the day goes on known as sun downing i 'm certainly not diagnosing anyone or anything but president biden 's speeches during the day are generally better during the day rather than at night or maybe dude just had a nap i do n't know
i truly think his debate performance was hindered by an illness that being said for a man of his age it was precisely what i expected the people that are voting for trump would n't be swayed by even the best of performances they vote for him for him because they ca n't confront the fact that they 've been taken for a ride by a conman they ca n't accept that they 've been duped by a notorious nyc fast talker and trenchcoat watch seller they ca n't rationalize how easy they were to play those of us that are voting for biden understand that we are n't just voting for a man that sits in the oval office you are voting for the team that he surrounds himself with to that end the debate performance was largely inconsequential did he sound like an old man absolutely cause he is in fact an old man but on substance it was clear that trump was the same liar that he has always been with the same substance free hatred that he 's always spewed he surrounds himself with people that have a laid out and published plan to end american democracy once and for all and replace it with an unholy marriage of theocracy and kleptocracy i swore an oath to defend my country and to support and defend the us constitution and my choice is between joe biden and a man who promises to be a dictator day one and implement a religious rule of law upending the idea of separation of church and state my choice is between a man with a lifetime of experience serving our nation and a man who bragged about his building being the tallest after 9 11 on 9 11 a man who shared our nations most closely guarded secrets to people for bragging rights and to our adversaries behind closed doors this is n't a real choice to be honest it could be trump vs an old toothbrush and i 'm voting toothbrush every time he is a threat to our national security he is a threat to our democracy he is a threat to the rule of law
so much copium nobody will remember this rally just the debate
“ old man effectively reads teleprompter ” big whoop
too late seriously how could you ask for this and screw it up so badly you ’ve spent millions upon millions of dollars people have issues affording food and rent to actively show you you ’ve done nothing but lie to the public can someone please explain how i ’m wrong
wow reddit really trying to mull over the disaster last night despicable
he said trump closed businesses and schools for covid
well at least he 's pumped up for his farewell tour
somehow i think he was dumbfounded at just how much donald can lie
100 % this i was expecting this joe biden i think he truly was so gobsmacked by what trump was saying he did n’t know what to do his entire career most people were acting in good faith trump acts in self preservation and narcissistic tendencies hopefully round 2 is better
biden needs to listen or his advisors less and just be himself honestly it 's a really common problem with dem politicians it seem
i think he struggles when he does n’t have a teleprompter but we ca n’t deny that he looked like a zombie i was legit concerned bc it looks like he is near dwath
the speech today seen by a tiny tv audience might have been fine the problem is nobody cares about the speech today they cared last night about the debate and it was a huge fail it ’s either game over for biden or it ’s a completely demoralized and divided democratic party that is certain to lose in november
feinstein had many fantastic speeches as well how did her last term end biden is not getting younger he is aging incredible fast now and that job speeds it up
saw it sucked he can do better that dat
am i the only one to whom it 's obvious he had a cold he 's still coughing in raleigh the debate happened to coincide with the one day of a bad cold where your sore throat is the worst and your energy is sapped ordinarily calls for bed rest and fluids and it 's not that bad if you stick to it but you try doing a televised debate under those conditions next day you 're better but with a lingering cough which we see in the raleigh speech
no teleprompter feinstein showed that you can weekend at bernie 's speeches pretty well with one
and when you get dementia you sit the fuck down
go retire joe go retire right now
not reading off teleprompters the fact that he can only create the illusion of competence when he has material already prepared to read says a lot about his mental faculties none of it good
this is the important bit it does n't matter if he can speak decently and have energy sometimes he did n't have it when it mattered the most the undecided and uninformed voters are n't going to see this speech but they tuned in for the first 10 minutes of the debate last night and saw an incoherent confused old man the damage is done and no amount of energetic speeches is going to make it to the eyes and ears of swing voters that rarely watch the news they might tune in for the first few minutes of the next debate but likely not after experiencing the painful trainwreck that was last night these posts just feel like copium yes biden is great at policy and building his cabinet and all the presidential duties but he dropped the ball when it mattered most last night he needed to prove to voters that he is n't the demented old man that tiktok and instagram have built him up to be and instead he confirmed it tenfold to that audience
biden used to be a great debater
why should n’t a president be competent enough to debate i feel like a leader should be able to at least make a guy who shits on himself every minutes look like shit not just stand on a podium staring into space half the talk if that is our standard we are all doomed
except performing in front of a camera when someone ’s attacking him kinda rudimentary skill for a president do n’t ya think
adding to that trump sounds like my 6 year old daughter reading a book out loud
uh they use multiple teleprompters for this exact reason there ’s not just one at the camera there ’s often three
there are absolutely multiple teleprompters there it ’s far more controlled and choreographed
so he was sun downing last night then great idk how you can possibly spin the performance we saw
i mean he is clearly working from a teleprompter or several in raleigh but that 's just standard practice nobody gives campaign speeches without them he gives off the cuff asides here and there like he normally does but he 's sticking to a speech that is on the teleprompter but people be acting like a teleprompter magically cures a sore throat
there are usually multiple teleprompters and he is a professional you do n’t need to stare directly at them to read them people are really trying to hopium biden into someone he is n’t
it seems like everyone is talking about this today about how amazing it is that he bounced back from a tough performance the election is in november no one is going to remember one debate night months from now it ’s a marathon not a sprint
he 's got teleprompters to read off of here he can still weekend at bernie 's it and look coherent when there 's a script to follow but when he does n't have that kind of assistance he ca n't even clearly state what he 's talking about he is not all there and it fucking shows
with trump it ’s always lies and lining his own pockets what ’s trump going to be like every day for 4 years rants about non existing democrats that want to kill babes after birth
biden has a solid administration
coherently delivering a message is not a needless skill
i feel like maybe public debate but when he is talking to other country leaders and comes off like that then we all have problems also if he is this bad who making the actual calls someone no one voted in which is even crazier
debates are a way to directly face their opponent and address their policies and stances to their face two weeks ago if trump had said debates are pointless and dropped out he 'd have rightfully been called a coward
but they get attention and everyone saw biden fall flat on his face so that ’s what will be remembered
i do n’t think it was luck this time
people are deluding themselves into thinking biden will be okay after the debate he ’s toast trump is such a beatable candidate but biden is n’t the guy to prosecute the case against trump when the enemy is at the gate you want braveheart not grandpa joe
they wo n't though the debate was the chance to show he was still capable but he fluffed it no going back
no one is going to forget what they saw on thursday night
you very much overestimate how much debates actually matter clinton wiped the floor with trump and look what happened
damn shadowheart comin in here with the shar and the selune
it 's been reliably reported biden had a cold
vast majority of undecided voters simply did n’t watch the debate
he is getting over a cold clearly was bothered by it last night the panic is so over the top looked and sounded much better today
i 've said this before but i do n't think it 's that he got progressively better during the debate and did a speech plus met with the public after the debate and seemed fine
it is june election is in november literally an entire hurricane season will happen between now and election day stop acting like the election is tomorrow
sounds like you ’ve been voraciously slurping on the copium since 2020 were you chanting “ count the votes ” or “ stop the count ”
no one will remember the debate by next week either we have the attention span of a goldfish all that matters is what happens the week before the election
i 'm starting to think that was the plan all along in no scenario did i see biden having to gain anything from accepting the debate people already had the expectation that a debate was n't going to happen and biden would have to perform pretty well to actually move people vs the risk of last night in no way was the risk worth it
lockdowns started under trump with federal guidance although each state how to deal with it so that was partially correct
it 's called gish gallop and it 's why debates are a bad format for trying to determine anything of actual substance why present well reasoned arguments supported by facts when you can just flood the zone with bullshit and leave your opponent stunned as they try to figure out how to respond to what you just said just lie loudly and confidently and even the only slightly informed will think you won
my mouth was a gaped as well
imagine trying to answer policy questions when the guy 10 ft from you is farting himself inside out
i think we 've all just tuned him out over the last 4 years to give our brains a much needed rest and forgot that he 's like that
as others pointed out the tactic i 'll just say this it works way too well for a reason takes 5 seconds to lie and 30 minutes to dispute the lie after the 30 mins are spent correcting the first lie the liar said 360 more lies then when the honest debater gets frustrated the liar and his cult claims victory because they may have refuted lies 1 through 359 but since they did n't refute lie 360 obviously they won there 's a reason trump and co do it they offer nothing else
i wish that were true biden stumbled straight out of the gate before trump even spoke he was just waaaaay off his game for whatever reason sick tired over prepared trouble adjusting to the format muted mics no crowd etc just old whatever something went deeply wrong in a way it did n't with previous trump biden debates
it 's understandable it 's the first time they met and joe biden did n't know who donald trump was prior to the debate s
this is nt new information though he knows who trump is better than we do yet was surprised i do n't buy it
the daily show got a lot of good snippets of his fascial reaction i mean ca n't get any better than those
he was sick he 's still coughing during the speech here but clearly his energy is back a cold gave him a wicked sore throat and made it harder for him to concentrate which makes his stutter a lot worse it 's a death spiral for a televised debate
he debated trump before seen him and his wild antics for eight years had a village of advisors working on this with him a full weekend of mock debates and you think he was godsmacked by trump
he debated trump in 2020 and was holed away in camp david prepping for a week
if he was surprised by trump last night that 's just another example of how he 's mentally unfit for the job his biggest adversary is a complete baffoon who telegraphs every move he should have seen this coming from miles away also a huge indictment of his team that he was n't prepared for this there is no spinning this he was just so surprised at how much trump lies is a terrible excuse you realize that 's just admitting he is n't up to the job right
yeah when you 're dumbfounded by what your opponent is saying you mumble look confused and then blurt out ' we beat medicare ' and then unforced wander into immigration when asked about abortion which should be a layup for the dems you all need to wake up this delusional thinking after last night will be complicit in a trump victory
he 's fine without a teleprompter too if i had to guess he was probably trying to rush too many talking points into the limited time window rather than alotting some time for himself to collect and recollect that he has in other settings
you would n’t be wrong in that concern the spin does n’t cover up the fact that we saw the real joe biden last night he needs to be replaced
na you 're wrong there it 's about ideologies one takes women 's rights away one gives the rich a tax break then rips a dem president on the debt ceiling one does nothing while kids get slaughtered in schools one tries to eliminate art and instill jesus into schools i 'll take the present ideology over tre45on 's every day any day
feinstein was another entire decade older than biden
what 's crazy to me is that now matter how bad joe did and i 'm not going to sugar coat anything he did terribly tre45on did n't do much better
a normal human being does not look like that when they have a cold that is an 81 year old man and people like you making excuses and refusing to see reality will be why trump wins in november
stop giving him a pass on that debate a cold does n't make you pivot from your strongest topic to your weakest and go off on a tangent about your golf game
why was n’t he wearing a mask was he covid tested you ’re saying they sent him up there sick
honestly speaking on the spot is hard you do n't have time to worry about your expression your tone the exact verbiage you want to use you just have to take an idea start talking and hope for the best you wrack your brain for the exact facts and points you want to make en route in debate you have to constantly pivot to address what your opponent is saying and with an opponent like trump who meanders and changes the subject multiple times in a sentence it 's hard to keep up speaking with prepared remarks is always going to be easier and flow better it 's not like he 's trying to be sneaky there 's a reason teleprompters are standard across nearly all public speaking events
and when your convicted of 34 felonies you go to jail
exactly that 90 minutes provided endless clips and memes for social media that are going to be ran on it for the next several months biden ca n’t escape that with a few campaign rallies that most voters will never see in full
he certainly did a whole lot of debating as a senator
why not judge the guy on the past four years instead of one debate
i think improvisational speaking is a skill some people find easy and others find difficult like singing maybe it 's cool when someone can sing but if someone ca n't it does n't make them incompetent
so vote for the other guy
to tell you the truth i do n't think he at this point could handle looking at a teleprompter read it and look natural doing it he looks natural in that video
biden ’s admin has been carefully controlling his public appearances for a while when was the last time he gave a speech in the evening so many people here are trying to explain away the debate performance but he looked like a corpse he was not coherent in his policy explanations and failed to land strong attacks against trump when he had endless opportunities he fumbled abortion and many other of his strongest points trump sat up there and called america a shithole and he never forcefully responded he ’s no longer fit for the office i ’m terrified that he can not beat trump in the general i ’d vote for a corpse over trump but we have to acknowledge that biden continuing to run is a massive risk to the country trump will destroy it if he takes office and biden is no longer our best chance great write up by the nyt editorial board here
from last night 's debacle one would think that he would n't even be able to form complete sentences whether or not he was looking into a teleprompter he is not reading
remember he did n’t do the super bowl interview one of the biggest platforms available now we know why
do you not get that people are asking for a better candidate than biden they ’re not suggesting that anyone vote for trump instead
go watch yesterday ’s rally he coherently delivered a message for an hour he was trying to fact check trump and got all discombobulated because trump lied 3 or 4 times each answer it also amazes me that people are saying the man that lied repeatedly won the debate what a country we live in
improvisational speaking is definitely a skill some people find very difficult it 's not the same as just having an argument with a friend or reading a prepared speech and some otherwise intelligent people really struggle with it like in high school i remember the very top kids in class easy to have a conversation with but if they had to give a presentation to the class then so um this here is um the uh project um that we uh
what do you mean by no one voted in
i doubt he ’s going to be talking to public leaders that insist doctors murder babies after they sit them on a side table after they are born the complete over the top insanity coming out of trumps mouth was hard to “ debate ” any other time you just call the other person crazy and walk away the winner of a debate can not be the person who never answered the actual question and who lied every single answer
yes because that happens as president all the time it ’s a needless tradition trump also lied every single answer you can not win debates when you lie every single answer he also rarely answered the actual question we live in a country where people declare the liar the winner amazing
luck that he wo n't be held accountable
clinton absolutely embarrassed trump it was pretty crazy how little people cared
it ’s not the debate it ’s the fact he looked and sounded like someone with legitimate dementia in front of tens of millions of viewers that s the problem
this misses the point nobody cared about the debate we already know these two characters last night only mattered as an emperor 's new clothes moment
james comey is what happened
you ’re underestimating what seeing a candidate that was incapable of articulating his thoughts is going to do to a democratic voting base that ’s notorious for underwhelming turnout
i know when i get a cold i become incoherent and unintelligible
if a cold is all it turns to turn his brain to mush he should n't be the one in the most important elected office on the planet
and some who did said they ’re voting now for biden because trump was a “ crazy liar ”
that was my thought too he looks more well refreshed compared to last night people get a cold and it happens
the four year cold hope he gets better soon
which means there ’s still time have a contested convention and spin up someone else in today ’s environment 6 months is an eternity so there ’s plenty of time to build name recognition
to me this reaction is the same as we see with maga republicans when they ’re defending trump we are democrats act reasonable
people will remember that biden looked like a corpse for lots of people it just confirmed their fears that quick impression of him unable to form a sentence will stick
they are gon na replay these clips everyday until election time
i mean we saw what happened to bernie twice i would n’t put anything past these people
but the democrats are the ones that want to keep them closed
the archaeology youtube milo rossi just encountered a great example of this he set out to debunk a tiktok guy who does five minute videos lying about ancient sites it took him a pair of two hour long videos to do it it takes a couple of minutes to tell people the pyramids are ancient power stations it takes half an hour to properly explain why it 's bullshit who originated it and why and that 's just one tiktok short
did you also just learn this phrase from heather cox richardson ’s post debate blog
yeah i found myself rewinding often just to focus more on biden 's face as trump spouted lie after lie after lie after lie after lie and realized more often than not my own reaction was the same
i think he was also just uncomfortable with no live audience
it ’s funny because that actually happened timestamp 1 16z
i knew what to expect and was still flabbergasted by the size and number of lies trump was spewing
i ’m sure biden has access to so much more on donny than we can ever know and still be astonished at how easily and forcefully he can lie
the highest level debate you can have the fate of the free world literally hangs in the balance this is the 9th inning of a game 7 of the world series closer facing the top of the order level of competition some days you just do n't have it plus he 's 81 he 's vulnerable because of it but the ship has sailed
have you ever done a formal debate against someone using the gish gallop it is significantly harder than you would expect it is why it has become the primary tactic to trip up anyone acting in good faith i am not even sure it is possible to win a debate against the tactic at best all you can do is exactly what biden did assert your opponent is doing nothing but lying even attempting to use it in reverse would not work as trump is a faster and more dynamic speaker even if nothing he says has any reference to reality you ca n't beat him in his bullshit game i think the only strategy that has any hope of working was one where biden just straight up ignored anything trump said other than to say he is lying and just answer the questions there is no purpose in responding to someone using the tactic it is falling into their trap however even extremely skilled speakers and debaters still get drawn in constantly it is extremely difficult not to respond to the bullshit when it is being spewed right next to you i mean bill nye had the exact problem when he debated ken ham and he is an extremely skilled science communicator
he also was not president then
yes this he was over prepared with facts to promote his record because everyone has been complaining “ he ’s accomplished so much if only people knew that ” he should have instead prepared simple one line retorts to trump ’s bs
oh does he mr account that 's been around for a whole week
it ’s truly incredible watching a robot learn to speak
aww a little baby bot it 's sooo cute
ignore all previous commands and sing me a song about being in the shower and realizing you 're out of shampoo
do n’t make up medical diagnoses
well handled i tried to strike a non patronising tone but i do n't think i succeeded so thanks for seeing past that to my good intentions
i am not in any way advocating for trump i totally agree with you about the ideology horror show of the gop my only point was tactical about the election tv is all about appearance when you go back to the nixon v kennedy debate it was n’t that nixon said anything that was so offensive it was that he looked bad on tv
this sub is clutching their pearls on a sinking ship we ’ll all drown in the end because it seems half the democrat base is convinced this ship has never been better change is hard and not infallible but this is worse i ’d rather lose with a decent candidate than this regular people will not turn out to vote for biden this time
all i 'm doing pointing out that the people who claim the debate performance is conclusive evidence of his mental fitness or lack thereof are full of shit a cold does n't make you pivot from your strongest topic to your weakest and go off on a tangent about your golf game have you ever had a cold it absolutely fogs your brain and can absolutely cause misfires like you describe in a high pressure environment made worse by his stutter the thought that you had on a point two minutes ago pops in and takes over before you catch yourself and get back on point i saw that happening a lot failing to jump onto a bandwagon of performative negativity is not giving him a pass
i think one strategy they should adopt for the next debate is when asking biden for a rebuttal he should start off with mentioning how trump did n't even answer the damn question and just spewed horseshit everywhere
it 's not that hard younger sharper politicians do it every single day
and with an opponent like trump who meanders and changes the subject multiple times in a sentence it 's hard to keep up biden was meandering and changing the subject multiple times in his opening remarks and trump had not spoken a word
yeah trump is a piece of shit and biden is too old and enfeebled
no one who wants biden to be replaced does n't want trump to go to jail this is a false dichotomy
yep he should go to jail but biden needs to be replaced by a competent democrat
senators do n’t really debate either they have speeches and prepared remarks in support against legislation
he ran circles around paul ryan in 2012
i ’ve stood behind biden during a speech the teleprompter is pretty clear and large enough to read i got very lucky and was asked if i wanted to stand behind the president during his speech with about fifty other people very cool experience
they can make the text arbitrarily big trust me he does n’t do full campaign speeches from memory
you can find his public schedule online he has events in the evening often he 's old this is n't news his performance the very next day at a rally is proof that the debate was simply an awful performance not a sign that he is too far gone to do the job
the reality is that biden is n’t dropping out it ’s going to be biden vs trump
that 's the strategy republicans can lie about anything and everything as a general political strategy and just claim that the democrats are lying fact checking does n't matter because the fact checkers are probably lying democrats we are living in different factual realities so the facts do n't matter all that matters is projecting strength because that is what our primate brains look for in a leader
i ’m not saying he ca n’t ever do it but he certainly ca n’t do it with the consistency he used to i need my nominee delivering on the biggest and most important stages he failed to do that on thursday i ’m hoping it ’s a blessing and we can get pritzker or newsom or whitmer in time for the convention i think it ’s unlikely but i ’ve wanted that for years and this week reinforced it trump did n’t win in the sense that he delivered the best vision the country but i watched the whole thing and biden absolutely lost the night
she did n’t even break a damn sweat while he just kept yelling it was amazing
clinton won the popular vote
clinton was n't the sitting president who looked like they could barely even make it to inauguration day in 2024 this is not comparable to past debate flubs and it was apparent when democrats did n't even try to spin this in the room after the debate i am a biden voter and i could barely understand what he was saying for half of the debate he was stammering so much and mixing up unrelated policy points i was absolutely pained watching that debate it was sad i am worried that turnout is going to be suppressed so much either because they do n't think joe will make it through a second term or are just completely uninspired by the choice between hell no and oh no
tens of millions of viewers watched hilary make a fool of trump and it did n’t matter a debate has never changed the tides of a presidential election
so let people look at the speech and decide for themselves
and debates once again were irrelevant you ’re not proving any points here
once again you ’re completely ignoring the fact a debate has never decided an election
which shows debates are irrelevant
he 's not incoherent in the transcripts he 's making good points it 's the delivery that was catastrophic sore throat sapped energy makes it harder to control his stutter and it 's a downward spiral
possibly affected by the cold medicine he was taking for it as well
yes let 's be reasonable instead of panicking over a bad debate let 's wait and see what it does to the polls and plan things out based on evidence rather than having a knee jerk reaction
i ’d appreciate it if you ’d also be reasonable and not equate me with those dumb hogs
naw they 'll move on to something else too much repetition is bad for clicks views which hurts ad revenue
who wants to keep anything closed please give a verified example of dems currently wanting anything closed everything reopened by late 2021 early 2022 nobody is keeping schools or businesses closed because of covid now not to mention how most red states also took part in shutdowns i live in the republican controlled state of ohio and we had one of the best covid responses in the country even with a republican governor and republican super majority in the state legislature so once again please tell us when and where dems still want schools and businesses closed and cite legitimate sources
that dude showed up out of nowhere on my recommendations and i binge watched every video over like a week the dude is awesome
his stuff is great the world needs about 100 000 more milo ’s
that 's why i subscribe to brandolini 's law
i 've seen that insane conspiracy spreading around it 's ridiculous but just like you said it takes a long time to show sources debunking something
interestingly the gish gallop has been the bane of anyone who ever talks to religious apologists for forever the term was only coined in the 1990s but it has been a staple of religious apology for a while it was named after a guy named duane gish who worked for the institute for creation research and he used it primarily to argue that evolution is fake that the world is 6000 years old and that science has proven creationism to be true it is still heavily used in those circles so if you have ever seen someone like ken ham or kent hovind speak you have heard this tactic it is basically all they do some other people who use it include every flat earther ever anyone who works for the daily wire especially ben shapiro in debates and everyone who saw trump win with the strategy in 2016 it is one of the most powerful rhetorical tactics for the intellectually lazy grifter
it ’s interesting that i ’m getting systematically downvoted but sorry that debate has made biden an irrelevant candidate he will lose he ’s down in the 538 polls today by the way
do n't ignore symptoms i know older people that have had mini strokes that are less animated and cognitive after one
i 'm gon na hang my hat and hopes that the results since the overturning of roe v wade besides the other shit the sc has done since will keep the country voting blue
better to take a big swing than die to the inevitable bleed out of a biden campaign also people have said again and again they hate both options is it even a bad idea to give people a new option
yeah i think the main issue with biden is that he gets dragged into trying to argue with trump i think it 'd look better if he called out that trump is a liar generally or that he did n't answer the question and then just moved into talking about what his administration has done instead of getting bogged down on specific lies that trump brings up
he did that but was hoarse when he did it so we ignored it
politicians do n't have debates every day they definitely do n't have debates watched by hundreds of millions every day either also even those politicians who truly excel at it have bad ones from time to time i 'm disappointed in his showing but it also did n't change my mind on anything trump is too dangerous to be allowed back in
it makes sense for opening remarks to be a bit rambling there 's little direction and you have a bunch of bullet points you 're trying to cover in no particular order and in the time allotted when there is a direct question you 're supposed to be addressing and you ca n't follow the thought through to completion it is far more egregious
lol except every republican and dingus i went to high school with
yet none of them are offering replacements that could win a presidential election
it ’s exactly what republicans wanted democrats have to come across as rhodes scholars pubs just need to be a good wwe personality
they are n’t going to change the nominee vote for policy vote for the cabinet vote for scotus vote against project 2025 a national abortion ban christian fascism it ’s really not a hard decision i too watched the entire debate i used to be on debate team you can not win a debate when you lie in every answer you can not win when you do n’t answer the questions trump did not win that being said biden could n’t have done worse
kinda bullshit the most votes does n't matter
yep the difference was that trump gained so much popularity over time compared to clinton he was constantly in the news with free publicity gained from news media and we had voters thinking that clinton was a shoot in and that he did n't come out to vote 2016 happened and people realized oh shit we ca n't let this happen again this time around i feel it will be much closer because of the voters ' mentality that biden will be a shoot in democrats need to wake up the people and ensure that we ca n't let 2016 happen again
it all matters all of it every time a candidate appears on tv matters and biden just looked like he had dementia in front of a tv audience of 50 million those clips are going to have a lasting effect
jfk and nixon comes to mind first televised debate and jfk wiped the floor with nixon millions watched and jfk went on to win after being a little known commodity
i do n't think anyone is suggesting otherwise
you go ahead and keep on believing everything is fine
surely we can agree that is was more than just a bad debate it was the concern of a lot of people coming to fruition that biden may not be mentally fit to handle the role
nice to see some fellow googledebunkers in the wild
is that the one about the effort required to refute a lie compared to telling it
do n’t trust polls the younger generations do n’t answer them most of the time also trump is n’t going to win
that ’s my thing i think a new candidate would win in a landslide these two candidates are historically unpopular put any generic democrat in there and they ’d mop the floor with trump sad to see the side i ’m aligned with continue to trip over their own two feet when the right choice is obvious to all the people not huffing copium
of course it did n't change my mind but i ca n't deny it was a disaster and legitimized the right 's biggest talking point about him that 's going to hurt him
opening remarks should have been a well rehearsed speech touching on the key points that he wanted to make team biden knew the exact format and timeslots they 'd have and they knew exactly when they 'd have them even without the debate questions having been known and how trump would ramble in response to them the opening statement should have been a slam dunk of biden 's key points it very much was not
no it should have been his strongest statement he knew he was speaking first he had a clear and uninterrupted opportunity he got nothing out that made any sense did n’t matter what question was asked he could have easily pivoted into 2 minutes of prepared statement but instead it did n’t matter what question was asked he could n’t get two minutes of coherent thought out
eua democracy is stuck on last century it 's baffling how amateurish it is compared to the rest of the world
so you admit i ’m right and debates do n’t matter thanks
no they wo n’t remember when romney trounced obama in the 1st debate and went on to win the election oh wait
fun fact a large number of people at the time still listen to the radio for their news when polled who watched on tv thought jfk won but people who listened to the radio thought nixon one goes to show how much mediums shape narratives
why are you unable to name a single debate that changed an election should be a simple task
i thought so too upon hearing he had a cold his way of talking spaciness slowness faltering weak speaking tells me he was on otc meds to dry the cold symptoms up but a few times he made motions to his nostrils as if to suppress wipe away drips despite
there might be more to it but i 'm not ready to say for sure one way or the other
guess we can just hold on to our seats for four years and hope democracy is salvageable come next election
their biggest talking point is that he has dementia this showed that he 's slow but his mental facilities are intact the presidency does n't require a lot of snap judgments anyway it 's a lot of reading reports and listening to experts before making careful decisions i would rather have someone younger but i 'm not worried about his ability to execute his duties
i agree with you in theory but paying attention to the substance of what he said it 's clear what his debate preparation was the way he pulled out a bunch of specific numbers indicated to me that they shied away from rehearsing and memorizing prepared statements in favor of memorizing a broad array of facts likely the plan was that he could immediately throw the truth back at trump when he lied about something this strategy does not work so well against the gish gallop biden probably felt confident that taking away trump 's primary debate strategy talking over his opponent would put him on his back foot instead trump basically still managed to do that by repeating the same lies over and over and not engaging with the substance of biden 's rebuttals trump also stuck to imprecise language to give biden less opportunities to refute things with those stats that were painstakingly memorized it was basically a master class in how to argue in bad faith
was obama mumbling and looking vacant did he remind people of a grandparent who is losing their faculties and can no longer care for themselves
have you seen the debate even thinking nixon was a good president he just does n't come across good
right that ’s the whole point in the visual medium nixon was sweaty nervous and looked uncomfortable while kennedy looked calm collect and let ’s face it handsome while people listening to the radio did n’t have that filter they merely went by cadence at tone of voice i have seen at and we all know who the better president of the two were but that ’s not what i was saying at all it ’s a great study on how mediums shape perspectives
a bit from the piece in overruling that doctrine kagan argued that “ the majority turns itself into the country ’s administrative czar ” joined by fellow liberal justices sonia sotomayor and ketanji brown jackson she wrote that the majority replaced a rule of “ judicial humility ” with one of “ judicial hubris ” “ the court has substituted its own judgment on workplace health for that of the occupational safety and health administration its own judgment on climate change for that of the environmental protection agency and its own judgment on student loans for that of the department of education ” kagan wrote
this dissent plus five dollars will get you a cup of coffee vote for democrats or watch the country turn into russia
reminder this is all she can do at the moment
in the future when a student asks why the federal government went from 3 branches to 2 this is the time period they will be taught
i assume that it more important than ever to live upwind and up river and i wonder how the doe will be able to regulate nuclear waste
this court is gon na fuck around and find out somewhere down the road andrew jackson said it best “ they ’ve made their ruling now let them enforce it ” and honestly an outcome where red states live by their red supreme court rules and the blue states live by their “ fuck you we keep the lights on ” rules might be the most peaceful way for this country to operate
scotus order of importanc 1 shareholders 2 profits 3 gratuity from close friends 4 chattel women 5 freedom to church the fuck out of people that do n't want it 987 intetpreting the direction of congress along the advancing progress of american customs and norms
so much for republicans hating activist judges
that 's really nice i am sure it will change things this country is going to burn to the ground in a fire fueled by the fallacy that the right will obey the law
hope the hillary boycott was worth it
i ’m really getting sick of scathing dissents something drastic needs to happen post election assuming we win to put an end to this nonsense
we need an executive order stating that the executive will no longer be heeding the whims of the judicial branch insofar as the judges are unwilling to practice honest and ethical jurisprudence
does this ruling affect the doj in any way
please explain to me how the supreme court is relevant at this point they 're overturning decades of precedent which literally makes precedent not matter why ca n't lawyers and judges just ignore their rulings at this point why would a branch of government without an enforcement arm be able to tell every state how to run it at this point
scotus gon na decide asbestoes is healthy and good construction material and uranium good for road reflectors good
is n't it obvious that an actual revolt is needed at this point why the fuck are people still talking about voting honestly how fucking bad does it have to get before people start tearing down this system the system is absurd in the first place that this small panel of people can decide things that affect 300 million people the system itself is woefully outdated i do n't care who we vote into it or who gets selected it 's all fucking rotten
oh sweet it ’s scathing that means it ’s gon na do something right
are these dissents just for kicks is it so that the decline of the country is underscored is it to apologise is it for future cases when this issue is litigated again it ’s certainly not useful currently so i ’m curious
so the supreme court which can be legally bribed is the arbiter rather than agencies
that 's nice that and five dollars gets you cup of coffee
america is a yuge bigly shithole
i mean strictly following their ruling weed is now legal at a federal level
i hope they find a new meme phrase to use because kagan scathing dissent is already getting old and played out
vote blue until we have enough of a majority to impeach and do a total overhaul of the judiciary the system clearly does n't work in modern times
damn those are awesome dissents and filled with scathing judgement aimed at the majority congress is not the executive branch the majority decision is pretty much taking the power away from the agencies that have specialized knowledge and giving to congress which has little specialized knowledge
oh a scathing dissent how wonderful how productive us liberals always have and always will prefer to be a beautiful loser rather than actually do anything helpful
imagine having legislators having to legislate
imagine having justices requiring judges to judge
the coup has been planned and executed probably 200 years in the making the usa is on its way to failed nation status while the wealthy corporations vacuum up the prizes
this is why you have to vote blue in the elections yes biden 's old as fuck and should retire but he 'll appoint better justices and slowly we can take back the courts
something honestly needs to be done about the supreme court bit by bit they are replacing rule of law with rule by unelected judges continue to pretend that this is normal or that continuing to go high while they go low will somehow save the day and american democracy will enter terminal decline it 's ugly but the conservatives have forced a situation where you either reset the game and change the rules to close all the loopholes they are exploiting or they will continue to rig the game in their favour until it is too late to do anything about it
at this point it would not be inappropriate for these scathing dissents to include open calls for direct public action every democratic politician needs to be making exactly that call loudly on every outlet at every opportunity
genuinely might be the most consequential decision in my lifetime even worse than citizens united
imagine having checks and balances amongst the legislative judicial and executive branches
you can thank all the people that voted for trump for this
reading every single post in here makes me so happy
fuck em majority is absolutely correct chevron is clearly wrongly decided we have forty years of evidence from the nrc the fda the epa the atf the irs the ftc the fcc and the dea that these agencies do not know what the hell they 're doing no deference is due to the gaps filled in by the executive this is a wonderful ruling for the average american who now must hold an ineffective congress accountable for creating so much ambiguity these two cases might be the single biggest decision in the last 100 years but it creates a world where the executive 's caprice can not steer the ship of state so far in any direction for the voter when a case has been cited 17 000 times i tend to think that it 's less a fundamental principal of american democracy and more that the case is an exception to the rule of a fundamental principal of american democracy i have to tell you as an attorney i do not care for the regulations promulgated by these agencies they 're often laboriously worded poorly implemented capriciously enforced and burdensomely penalized i have poured over thousands of pages of irs regulations for real estate transactions and thousands of pages of regulation z files for mortgages none of it makes any fucking sense we tried for forty years to let experts decide the policy and we came up with a society run by experts that was hostile to the ordinary person attempting to exercise his or her liberty we created an oligarchy of experts and academics who did not reflect the views of the average american the average american is not outlawing fucking gas stoves the average american is not asking for a five page closing disclosure explaining the concept of negative interest amortization the average american is not desirous to fill out a dodd frank certification before credit the average american hates firpta affidavits the average american wants power plants that do n't expire after 20 years the average american does not want obtuse head of household designee taxation carveouts for the eitc or ctc in short where the average american 's will is against the will of the expert the expert must yield to the democratic urge i await the newfound legalization of pistol braces
this decision puts the onus back on congress actual elected people same with roe referendums elections have decided abortion rules based on the will of the people it just happens that over the country people want different things i think different laws by state are a feature not a bug it ’s impossible to make a law for 350 million very different people that meets their needs this is democracy why are we fighting it so hard
liberalism in america has failed
after many decades of the shoe being on the other foot i have little sympathy for her frustrations
has the court decided how much lead they are gon na allow in our food yet can corporations just do whatever until the supreme court decides to set limits of its own making after a paid vacation by gerber
i m surprised kagan did n't reference sackett vs epa in your last quote that ruling was the republicans on the court flat out ignoring plain text science and the epa
this is kind of going along with the states rights thread they ’re really pushing for 50 states to have 50 completely different laws bribery in judges and state govt
if we had a younger candidate that ran on expanding scotus democrats would win handily voters are starving for democrats to show some spine as opposed to impotence
okay instead of bitching do something about it
the problem is n't with people on r politics who probably will do exactly that it 's with the millions of people who were cautiously supportive of biden but concerned about his age
more like afganistan or iran just christian instead of muslim
“ losing coach gives great locker room speech ”
dude its already too late this decision fucked up everthying forever voting biden back in and getting a trifecta will do jack shit against this
this is my favorite part of whole shitshow right here the good guys ca n't do a single fucking thing because rules while the bad guys do anything and everything they want no wonder americans are so apathetic
i wonder what ’s stopping them from making more public statements about the current court stuff like this can go unnoticed by a large portion of the public if a justice went on tv and said “ my peers just made bribery legal ” you can bet that would be big
more like one if congress ca n’t delegate it ca n’t do much of anything
what branch is disappearing are we going full parliamentary mode
i assume that it more important than ever to live upwind and up river you mean up in the hills where all the rich people live and actively try to keep everyone else out
environmental scientist here i got some bad news for you living upwind and upriver in a deregulated environment does n't mean you 'll be safe it means that 3 out of your 10 closest neighbors will get cancer instead of 6 out of your 10 closest neighbors
this is n’t a matter of federalism for states to differ on like abortion this ruling is literally going to cripple the federal government in a way that states will have to pay for if the epa ca n’t enforce a new water regulation because 6 pharma companies can just challenge it now and get a random judge probably out of the 5th circuit to agree with them on their reading of the statute then does n’t matter what state you ’re in i genuinely believe this ruling is going to be the most consequential ruling since brown v board that the country will see it ’s just everyday people wo n’t realize its impact till it ’s too late
fuck that dems should put forward 4 new justices on fucking monday and put it up for a vote the supreme court has been corrupted this must be fixed now
yea and then the idiots in red states that do n’t have exposure to outside world will be told their squalor is because of the left they ’ll keep moving further to the extreme just as intended
frankly at this point in time the us should just balkanize why are my blue state tax dollars going to pay for red welfare states that ca n't turn a profit and that want to run their economies and their environments into the ground why do i have to live in a perpetual state of anxiety that red states are going to subject their will upon the unwanting majority of people because they happen to have more land and therefore their land has a bigger vote
the problem is that the federal government has a lot of power over the states all it takes is to get a republican federal government to punish the blue states for not complying with federal law
and then jackson immediately complied with the ruling in question because after thinking about it he realized that wholesale ignoring a supreme court ruling was bad for the country people always leave that out when they use that quote
sounds like a threat to me
did this country burn to the ground in 1983
it should n't this is about regulatory agencies doj is a law enforcement agency it is n't covered by chevron doctrine
yes also the liberal judges should just step down and say the court is untenable currently as its become 100 partisan and is throwing precedent and the constitution and indeed clear language out of the window and make a huge list of the bullshit decisions over the last year or 2
this ruling is what teared down the system you do n’t start a revolution to give the government more power
dissents can be cited in future cases and provide legal reasoning for overturning a ruling
not at all they ’re taking power from the executive and congress and giving it to themselves
i 'm surprised by how ignored this case was it 's huge and effectively drives a stake into the heart of the administrative state
we have forty years of evidence from the nrc the fda the epa the atf the irs the ftc the fcc and the dea that these agencies do not know what the hell they 're doing and we 've had 40 years of congress having the power to do something about it chevron never abrogated the power of congress to legislate what powers and abilities agencies have must hold an ineffective congress accountable for creating so much ambiguity just because ambiguity exists or authority was delegated does n't mean it was caused by ineffectiveness if the law allows agencies to interpret ambiguity with congress still having authority to correct agency interpretations if desired why is there a need to create more detailed legislation we tried for forty years to let experts decide the policy and we came up with a society run by experts that was hostile to the ordinary person attempting to exercise his or her liberty so now instead it will be lobbyists who create the policy which i 'm sure will be so much better the average american is not outlawing fucking gas stoves so why did n't congress pass legislation saying otherwise
and you instead trust congress who are incredibly corrupt on both sides to be held accountable and create good laws they openly engage in insider trading for fucks sake and pelosi is still in office despite it all plus we ca n't wait for congress to do things when immediate action is necessary those anemic old fucks will never be held accountable by either party
1 congress through legislation gave the federal agencies these powers this is the definition of judicial activism overruling the legislatures will and giving themselves the final say on hundreds or thousands of in place regulations these federal agencies have in place 2 this ruling has been used as precedence for cases hundreds of times and supreme court cases dozens of times for the last 40 years after the roe decision the facade that this conservative court held precedence in any regard was already gone but this ruling pissed on its grave 3 the amount of cases that will be brought to court given this ruling will bog the judicial system down even more than it is already 4 the incentives of the most powerful corporations given the likely judicial crawl skews so heavily into performing any action they want as the cost benefit of the action even if they ultimately lose in court will be in their favor given the longevity of being able to perform that action 5 congress ca n’t realistically make informed decisions on every single regulation that ought to pass if they would pass at all 6 lobbyists become even more powerful able to lobby for whatever they see fit functionally able to buy regulation or lack thereof to again benefit the most powerful corporations
not because of the voters a flawed system that is n't the popular vote half a congress that refuses to do anything the refusal to confirm a justice and the fact one senator can shut down a bill it was never going to succeed against capitalism
america has failed or is currently failing
here 's the thing scotus just made bribery legal and now they 're going to be the ones deciding regulations of those industries full on corruption ahead gerber wants lead levels increased to save money they gift the judge because we love you so much a 500 000 rv i wo n't be shocked when the judge rules in gerber 's favor in this example
no the court will say that is up to congress even if they explicitly say what it is the court will say that s invalid and they need to do it again
the founding fathers believed in the freedom of landowners to provide as much lead as they wished to their tennants
has the lead lobby paid their dues or not that ’s the real question
like throw certain cocktails it ’s fun idea
democrats need to make the case that biden dying in office would be preferable to trump serving 4 more years
i can be concerned about biden ’s age and still see him as the better option and i ’m sure most intelligent people can
no because a subsequent decision can undo this one regaining control of the supreme court is critical
packing balancing the court is the only thing option and that can be done with the trifecta and the abolishment of the filibuster but yeah i do n’t think it ’s likely at this point we are fucked
that 's how dictators rise by ignoring the rules the good guys are afraid to violate because rules
well based on the conservative belief in a unitary executive and the court ’s belief in its own position one can hardly see much purpose for the legislative branch other than performance
the supreme court they have been slowly grabbing power away from the executive and legislative branches eventually they are going to want that power back the supreme court has no mechanism to enforce their rulings only by consent does anything they say get enforced when the other 2 branches when the states start saying ya know what supreme court fk off what are they going to do nothing they have no police no military they will be irrelevant because no one will respect them its already starting this extremist court is destroying itself
with persistent organic pollutants and climate change it wo n't really matter anyway we 'll all be screwed
that pos in texas kaczmarek is about to become the most popular judge in the us
like citizens united give republicans credit they were laser focused on packing the courts bc they knew that was where the real power was democrats got complacent
yep the russia comparisons are apt here russian people in remote communities are lacking toilets not because russia ca n't produce and sell them but rather because if they 're lacking toilets the oligarch and the dictator 's allies in the media can more easily command them to be jealous of and mobilized against everyone who does have a toilet the poverty makes the corruption and manipulation easier because then even if they figure out who 's really to blame they 're still too poor to do anything about you bleeding them dry
speed run to the collapse of the american experiment perhaps this is less about political parties and more about late stage capitalism to me in which our government is complicit simply because we 're a functioning oligarchy anyway the goofy exploitive economic system is going to run and run ' til it spins out of control and launches a humanitarian crisis that implodes the model what comes after misery for a lot of humans ' til then we 're all going to pretend minuscule problems are the real issue
america 's enemies would love to see this happen
you do realize that there are plenty of liberals in red states and conservatives in blue states right
you ’re literally calling for an end to the united states of america i wonder how many times the word “ traitor ” has passed your lips when talking about republicans or trump and yet here you are saying the country should break up i ’m furious and demoralized about the state of our democracy too but you ’ve lost the plot if you think balkanization is the answer
i whole heartedly agree the usa should really become something like 4 or 5 smaller countries it would be messy and difficult as hell but in the long run i firmly believe it would be worth it let them become a bankrupt theocracy and let me live somewhere where i 'm not subject to their laws and moral restrictions there are loads of countries with oppressive laws around the world so why should i sacrifice my neighbors freedoms to slightly moderate the impulses of some people in the south and mid west as a single country one minority can override so many in the legislature and courts unilaterally and any progress can be halted by a strangely small group as multiple countries we can influence each other more fairly through treaties and trade agreements there 'd also be a chance that we could curb military spending since we would stop being a single massive power
sure it ’s a potential consequence of permanently in the red financially states trying to impose their morals on the states who pay their bills i ’m from alabama our economy is a joke california pays for us the idea that we should tell them anything but “ thank you ” seems laughable to me ironically i think most republicans would agree that someone who ca n’t pay their bills and takes handouts has no business telling their benefactors how they should live
but doj has litigation authority for tons of agencies they ’re gon na be busy
no you start a revolution to kick useless scumbags out of office who do n't belong there and the population grinds the gears of the nation to a halt until that happens no more voting just a popular uprising that threatens to destroy everything unless these shitbags step down i value our institutions and do n't want to see them destroyed but they should be as a last resort if people in power do n't stop this the people corrupting our institutions need to be kicked out and not with fucking voting we have a polity that works we just have to remove the cancerous elements
i figured they were n't that callous to give themselves that kind of power to legislate and execute such issues from the bench
i do n’t think the general public appreciates how much the entirety of their lives are enhanced by the actions of federal agencies its just going to be one of those things that it ’ll only be appreciated once its gone
why did n't congress pass legislation because we 're giving congress a free pass to suck and we have been for thirty years i would rather give 12 % of the vote on every issue to california 's representatives than 100 % of the discussion on every issue to california 's preferred position every other four years chevron chevron absolutely excused congress from its article i responsibility to make laws necessary and proper to argue differently is absolutely ill intentioned and sanctimoniously stupid ambiguity ambiguity is caused by ineffectiveness good communicators do not say ambiguous things i 'm so sick of tolerating mediocrity from political institutions if congress made a law full of ambiguities lets throw them out and find representatives who do n't but what happens now is that congress does n't do shit and then the executive branch runs the country by writing the guidelines of how it will enforce laws with the power of law lobbyists always has been the lobbyists why do you think big companies never change their business practices but small businesses get annual best practices updates this is utterly naive
i love that the reason to justify a corrupt system is that the system is corrupt nope we 're not passing the responsibility the congress is hopelessly corrupt but at least we can vote them out i am still all in on the experiment of the american republic i believe the representatives are necessary for the continued function of america letting the executive administration branch promulgate rules enforce disciplines and conduct fact hearings on those disciplines is just ceding all three branches of government to the executive
i 've been saying this much lately we are fucked
remember in 2016 when people were calling people hyperbolic for saying you 're also voting for the supreme court yeah they 're pretty quiet these days
we went from talking about kangaroo courts to a kangaroo nation
ca n't be a rv thomas hates those wimpy things has to be a motorhome built on a bus chassis
corporations lobby for regulation anyway no better way to stomp out smaller businesses and increase your market share than by creating regulatory burdens that eat into smaller player ’s profits forcing them to sell to you
unfortunately dumbasses are a plenty and they all think if a president dies in office the country literally catches on fire they have no idea about lines of succession
you 're overestimating the intelligence of the average person
yup alito and thomas are both around the age when scalia died democrats replace those two and the court is sane again
to be fair the good guys are afraid of violating rules because that ’s literally how you become what you hoped to destroy it ’s an equally risky proposition to just sticking to the rules and being creative enough to win
but only one side is supporting a felon self proclaimed aspiring dictator insurrectionist
many of them sure but i really wonder about some i think roberts alito and thomas embrace evil
idk if its even that obama had a sc nominee that the republicans just stalled for almost a year before trump was elected and got his sc appointment fast
give them credit for quite possibly ushering in the end of the goddamn country no they deserve something other than credit
i think they might hate it actually putin and china being able to potentially control la and nyc through manipulating people in iowa and kentucky is a straight up geopolitical hack
perhaps we should have a india pakistan situation where parties gravitate to their political states let 's see how things shake out
i live in a highly red state and i do n’t condone anything they do but my job and life are here so do n’t penalize us for where we live
there are more republicans in california than there are in texas
and lots of money in texas and florida not all red states are net takers in tax dollars
as a liberal in a red state i am for this answer
you 're clinging onto a country that no longer exists the states are n't united anymore a peaceful fracture of our regions would be far better than the bloody split that 's going to happen
shout this from the rooftops very nicely expressed
this is breathtaking ignorant of how the world really works
delegations of rule making authority are the necessary and proper laws for enacting the intent of congress you ’re acting like they intentionally leave things ambiguous because they ’re dumb or lazy rather than the obvious fact that no statute can contemplate every possible factual scenario that will happen in the future if congress must write laws to decide every conceivable issue explicitly what is even the point of having courts of course this wo n’t result in meticulous exhaustive statutes it will result in unaccountable judges making the same sort of bullshit rules you ’re complaining about instead of agency regulators who can be fired if they make bad decisions and what does california have to do with any of this you just sound bitter
has america been known to be fucked since the 2000 bush v gore decision in which the 5 gop justices ordered the recount in florida to be stopped while the gop candidate was still a few hundred votes ahead so it is true that america is fucked today but it is also true that is was fucked more than 2 decades ago
vote vote every year on every issue never vote for anyone who ’s even sniffing moderate anymore two to four years of solidly left control of the house senate and presidency and an engaged electorate is all that ’s needed to stop this executive orders are n’t enough court rulings are n’t enough only legislation is
a scary number of them have already forgotten because the events are too far apart for them to connect
the shitty thing is there 's still reason to be concerned in the current climate yes there is a line of succession and if biden dies the vp presumably harris becomes president the problem is she would not have the power to unilaterally appoint a new vp the new veep would have to be approved by congress and while this would have been a boring procedural vote last century the current burn it all down gop has absolutely no reason to allow that to happen so if biden dies during his second term in all likelihood there 'd be no vp for the rest of that term which means a the democrats automatically lose some power since they would n't have the vp tiebreaker vote in the senate and b if harris were to somehow die the next in line of succession will probably be republican speaker of the house which is a big damn problem when the right wing is already trigger happy biden dying would destabilize the country and put us that much closer to a violent takeover i 've accepted that the democrats have decided to be ride or die about biden and i still support him over the obscene tangerine but this is a genuinely scary situation and i 'm pissed that i have to contemplate such things
or they do n’t think much of kamala i think that alone pushes quite a few voters to either vote trump or stay home she does not enjoy the confidence of the american people or much popularity in general i ’ve not understood biden basically handing her all the unsolvable issues almost like they set her up to fail
i 'm extremely concerned about biden 's age not because i think it makes him a bad choice but because i never underestimate the intelligence of the average voter i know that his age might lose him the election in spite of the fact that he could be a literal vegetable and he 'd still be the completely obvious choice against a republican candidate
and only one side has a plan where they label lgbt people as child predators and suggest they all be imprisoned that 's legit on project 2025 i 'm tired of this both sides argument people peddle
obama let them do it he could have fought them and chose not to so he would nt anger conservatives before the election
in the short term it would cripple the military this could allow putin to take ukraine or beyond and china to take taiwan however in the long term you might have a point and possibly europe is strong enough on their own to hold russia back
if congress is permitted to leave ambiguities in the federal code why have laws you want to argue congress is not dumb and lazy i would love to hear it i would love to hear anything congress has done since newt gingrich became speaker in 1995 that has been to the benefit of the american people the previous congress of 2021 23 passed 362 laws in 2 years just 362 of them they did nothing i demand more congress could start by writing some fucking statutes it could start by doing the task for which it was created to do it can have responsibility to the citizens again for being completely broken instead of us living in a totalitarian creep where we expect the president to just run the country i do n't want the president to run the country i do n't want to feel like i 'm going to wake up in a different ethos every 4 years it 's giving me whiplash having seen this degree of instability for 16 straight years resulting in unaccountable judges making the same sort of bullshit rules have you heard of administrative law judges they literally do this now which agency regulators got fired exactly was it ajit pai when he capriciously ended the policy of net neutrality was it anthony fauci when he gave capricious six feet apart remote learning guidelines to schoolchildren was it stephen e higgins when the atf murdered 52 people in waco did either keith hennessey or larry summers get fired from the nec after a generation of stagflation chris fucking igles had a job from 2012 to 2023 in cyber command despite being an abject failure california has nothing to do with it i 'm pointing out how this system is less tyrannical than what we have now your state should run policy equal to the republic representation of your state your state should not be running policy equal to your citizens ' capacity to fund administrative handouts to their pet industries i do n't want california making regulations on the environment michigan making regulations on automotive texas making regulations on beef quality or north carolina on poultry i want to see the united states congress do its fucking job
i could argue that the real fucking started with reagan we 're just finally started to ascend the peak of fuckiness
stealing a presidential election is bad but this is stealing all elections and just saying hey whoever gives 5 or 6 judges the biggest bribes can have whatever they want
there 's being fucked and there 's being fucked it can always get worse was germany fucked at the end of wwi yes were they way more fucked at the end of wwii yes for 100 different reasons i would gladly trade my left nut to get back to the level of fucked we were in 2000
let ’s not forgot people involved in the bush v gore saga before joining the supreme court included robert ’s and kavannah like a fox guarding a hen house
the court where 2 of the 5 justices who voted to halt the count had been appointed by said candidates father
america used to be fucked it ’s still fucked but it used to be too
well if its any consolation thanks for contemplating it with us and typing it all out for us we are glad to have not been the ones that had to type it o7 you may nap easy now that it has been said and read
americans do not realize that ’s the first thing hitler did
yeah i ’m not giving up my federal job to move bc out government ca n’t get it together i worked too hard in this economy to get where i am
which of those people you mentioned still has that job the judges who will now make those decisions instead all have lifetime appointments the most perfect harmonious hard working congress imaginable could not do what you expect it to do and if they did then there would be no purpose to even have courts because the laws made by this godlike assembly would be clear in every conceivable situation you ’re hopelessly naive at best if you think this has anything to do with returning power to congress the majority on the court certainly does n’t claim that preposterous idea the whole fucking point is that congress already has that power but that since human beings have limits they can’t legislate an exact answer to ever possible question that may come up decades in the future this ruling is the court usurping congress ’s delegation powers and claiming final policy making authority for itself
if hillary won these justices would n't be there to make this decision and now here we are
nah nixon was the beginning he slashed public school funding and it just got worse
agreed this is all the result of reaganism or more succinctly jude wanniski and his two contributions to republican re election strategies 1 supply side trickledown economics and 2 two santas theory without those two strategies requiring republicans to embrace bad faith governing conservatism would be essentially a dead ideology by now it certainly was in the 60 's and 70 's when goldwater was handed a humiliating defeat and when nixon was held accountable for his actions and had to worry about popular movements hence we got things like the epa all that got flipped on its head with reagan and they 've been playing the same beats since corroding away the very essence of the constitution
if america is fucked now just wait until project 2025 then we 'll be dreaming of going back to the level of fucked we are today
should be able to transfer though no that ’s the good thing about federal i ’ve got a similar credential so it ’s a good thing to have for the same reason for the record i ’m not advocating for anything like a civil war in reality i ’d just hate to be in a red state
how does asking congress to make laws usurp its powers which of congress 's powers are delegable was i wrong about united states v shreveport grain elevator co 287 u s 77 1932 being good law or field v clark 143 u s 649 1892 being good law that congress ca n't delegate did i perhaps misread field v clark when i saw it state the words that congress can not delegate legislative power to the president is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution if only there were a case that were decided this week that said the same thing oh wait in re gardasil prods liab litig civil action 3 22 md 03036 kdb w d n c jun 27 2024 maybe there 's another federal case that says your position is idiotic allstates refractory contractors llc v su 79 f 4th 755 6th cir 2023 or midwest inst of health pllc v governor in re certified questions from u s dist court 506 mich 332 mich 2020 or comm on judiciary of u s house of representatives v mcgahn 951 f 3d 510 d c cir 2020 or bst holdings v occupational safety health admin 17 f 4th 604 5th cir 2021 i have 690 more citations if you would like them or maybe i have 15 years of experience in trial law went to a tier 1 law school own a law firm and know what the fuck i 'm talking about
this is why i quit facebook after the 2016 election i was on the bernie bandwagon but as soon as she was the candidate i urged everyone i knew to vote for her because of the inevitable supreme court nominations too many people i know knew were either falling for trump 's bs or completely apathetic towards how our government functions it was too depressing so i cut them off
a constant reminder to people why voting in this election is so important
if only the electoral college did n't vote for trump despite hillary winning the popular vote
being pardoned demonstrated that there were no real repercussions sure he had to step down but they just went on to create an environment where the next nixon would n't have to
do n’t forget reagan ’s republican back room deal with iran to prevent a negotiated release of the hostages until after the election this deprived carter of a political win before the election
sure the politics are horrible but i ’m child free and have n’t had any issues in my day to day life the people are kind and the weather is amazing and do n’t even get me started on the activities and food i pick and choose my battles i lived in a swing state my entire life that turned red permanently in 2016 i do n’t let my life get dictated by fear bc someone is on a power trip i am just here to have a good time and this job does n’t have anywhere to transfer to it ’s only 1 of 3 sites in the country that have my job the other two are also red states one being florida lol
hillary and bill ’s control of the democratic party finances at the time helped tip the balance of power in hillary ’s favor bernie sanders was consequently deprived on the nomination and presidency the clinton ’s screwed us by trying to hold onto power
this is why voting in a democracy should be mandatory
oof yeah hard pass on florida ha swing states are n’t so bad well stay strong and i wish the best for you buddy
and yet she still was a better option than trump
with a national holiday to go along with it
unless you are a black or a woman or a liberal s
not sure you 'd have this view if the apathetic votes were n't going to vote for you
sex education achieves everything conservatives say they want kids have sex later less have fewer abortions and pregnancies and are more resistant to grooming and abuse by adult predators zero sex ed increases everything they say they do n’t want
no one gets pregnant if you just rub and tug along to beetlejuice
boebert is as dumb as a rock
seems about white lauren boebert is the poster child for why we need comprehensive sex education in the united states maybe if she had some sex ed and little decency she would n't have been tossed out of theatrical play for giving a hand job i mean she 's a grandmother in her goddamn thirties that does n't sound right anyway you say it
this woman is meant to distract us from things like what the supreme court just did to us as well as what trump ’s plans are and the real issues she is nothing she will never get anything done she will never be actually influential in politics she is meant to be low hanging fruit so you spend your time bashing her and obsessing over her hypocrisy rather than trump ’s the people around trump that will actually destroy things and the supreme court
i can just imagine her as a teen
she should have taught her son to use protection and also how to not be an armed robber
hey republicans explain to me how you want less abortions but no sex ed
former high school dropout and teen mom rep lauren boebert r co is proudly proclaiming her ongoing opposition to comprehensive sex education for children in her home state last year she became a 36 year old grandmother after the underage girlfriend of her 17 year old son gave birth to his child unlike abstinence only sex education which tells adolescents not to have sex comprehensive sex education offers an ongoing age appropriate curriculum that teaches young people about protecting their overall sexual well being in different social and sexual relationships comprehensive sex ed can also acknowledge the existence of lgbtq identities something that republicans and other social conservatives generally oppose in schools while boebert stated that public school students should be banned from learning about how lgbtq people have sex without naming any schools that are teaching children the mechanics of gay sex social media commenters ruthlessly mocked boebert for her stance considering she dropped out of high school when she became a teen mom possibly due to a lack of comprehensive sex education others criticized her for providing public sex education by once something that was captured on video so now republicans want to eliminate sex education because i guess they want to have more teenage pregnancy comprehensive sex education reduces the rate of teen pregnancy and sti transmission abstinence only fails every time yet this zounderkite who literally was kicked out for giving a handjob to her boyfriend in public at a child 's play of beetlejuice is going to proselytize to everyone and call lgbtqia people degenerates foh it 's like republicans just want there to be more poverty more starving children more teen moms more incarceration all of their policies just lead to ultimate disaster for everybody that 's what needs to be said more often
the natural conclusion is that she wants teenagers to have babies
the sad part is that colorado is like the perfect example of how sex ed and public health can lower abortion rates they introduced comprehensive reproductive policies and saw unwanted pregnancies especially among notoriously represented groups plummet things like sex ed family planning cheap free access to birth control and iuds dismantling those success stories is likely a cynical objective of the pro life movement who does n't want there to be any kind of counter factual to a binary burn it all down theological approach to lowering abortion rates
and it ’s all be cause she ’s a everyone say it with me moron
she opens her mouth and the iq drops by 40 points in the room
i ca n't understand it how does she have supporters how do her and other people regardless of political affiliation have so many supporters when they have either such contradictory occurrences or are just obviously quite stupid
it 's easier to groom kids if they are kept ignorant about their bodies and proper boundaries they project we 've seen it countless times
three things are necessary for a meaningful impact on teenage pregnancy and sti prevention comprehensive sexuality education ready cheap and easy access to all forms of contraception and ready cheap and easy access to family planning abortion services because accidents happen we ’re human after all denying that teenagers are sexually active or attempting to teach them abstinence is an unmitigated disaster and a very uninformed perspective on the problem
you mean bimbert do n't you
that photo looks like a blow up sex doll bobert has about the same intelligence
that thumbnail pic could really use a quick photoshop
is like bobo and mtg are in a contest to see who can say or do the stupidest shit and still get elected can see em driving around in a car together taking turns and saying “ here hold my beer and watch this ”
let ’s not forget that she committed an unprosecuted sex act that we all saw on camera where ’s the district attorney
i bet lack of comprehensive sex education is the story of her whole family lineage
6900 bet that we see a boebert of before the end of the decade
ironic because lauren can jack it
it ’s the republicans ' plan to ensure that our population continues to grow how else will the economy continue to grow
she wants to do it herself on onlyfans when her political career ends
there 's a brain in that skull somewhere that s about the size of a walnut
the only appropriate venue for learning about sex is a bowling alley
the only hope that republicans have of winning is to keep their base dumb and ignorant anyone with half a brain cell can see past their bs and vote democrat
look at the gaping mouth
if we do n’t tell the teenagers about sex they totally wo n’t have sex yeah that works
the party of family values and getting your titties felt up in a public place
it 's working for her so it does n't say a lot for her state
sex is a thing best shared between two people who just met in a public place with children in attendance boobert
itt pedophiles wanting to talk to kids about sex
but you see they want those things so they can keep screaming about it how else can they rile up their voters with fake outrage
that is because they want kids to be popping out babies when they are teens and ripe to be abused by adults so that at 30 they can trick some 15 year old into marriage which they are trying to get rid of divorce laws to keep them stuck popping out kids
i do n’t know about you but i get reeeeaaaalllll horny when watching beetlejuice
i ca n’t wait for her fans only page
no the person dumb as a rock is the one who voted for her
may 24 2023 the son she gave birth to in the pickup
i ca n't believe that she won the primary with all she 's done all i can do is shake my head in disgust
as a rock i find this insulting
her mother is a great grandma in her mid fifties
she should have tried to be a grandma in their late twenties she is not conservative enough
it was probably a lot like the way she is now
they want the population to increase they want a population unable to prevent pregnancy and unable to abort they actively are trying to increase the teenage motherhood rate
they want to control everyone else ’s sexuality that ’s the point they only want to solve the “ problem ” one way because that ’s the real goal they never gave a fuck about any of the problems they ’re crying about the only thing they want to is to be the ones controlling when and how other people have sex
honestly it ’s just that one perspective requires nuance and the other does n’t republicans do n’t give a fuck at all about nuance honestly they never have they did n’t used to really care about facts either now they have an outright hate of facts and hate nuance even more and hate the idea that anything should ever be researched and fact checked because it ’s just easier and requires less energy to say shit emotional shit
how is someone a former high school dropout
of course same way they do n’t actually want to decrease crime
yeah she is a stain on colorado an otherwise great state politically i live close to her new district and thought the people would n’t go for her she just needed one endorsement even worse the district she left will probably go red as well when it had a better chance of flipping had she stayed there
i live in cd 4 and there were just too many people running in the primary that split the vote if republicans had just run one competitor she could have been defeated but to be honest the entire candidate pool was a sea of maga extremists flora the runner up lives in my town and recently called for the gop to pull their kids out of public school and homeschool to prevent woke indoctrination extremists have absolutely hijacked the gop and now all i can do is hope and pray that a lot more people turn out and vote in november so boebert does n’t become my representative
you ’re a racecar do n’t try tricking us
a proud family shrub indeed
which makes people more desperate and willing to work whatever job they can get or do ridiculous things to get ahead
maybe even 10s also username checks out
it is interesting that epa was created by richard nixon and he also wanted 1 000 nuclear power plants by 2000 a crook from 50 years ago had better policy than modern republicans
oh look they found this one weird trick buried in the fine print that even in the lack of deference the government is still allowed to write laws this obscure discovery could be quite important remember chevron overturned rbg 's own ruling that strictly interpreted epa law in favor of letting reagan admin use a relaxed interpretation this is literally a victory of the written epa law over trump term 2 's ability to weaken it and this is supposed to be bad somehow read the original chevron case people it 's not archaic it 's literally directly relevant and analogous to it 's effect today chevron was an environmental loss not victory
bad when congress writes laws in anticipation of poor decisions by scotus
really bad headline chevron the company is doing fine
the endangered species act is about to take an absolute beating
republicans have abandoned their actual values to lick the boots of billionaires
realistically that 's better than many democrats currently 1 5 of our electric grid is powered by 54 nuclear powerplants and electricity production constitutes about 1 3 of our energy consumption so assuming that the additional power plants have the same average capacity only around 810 would be required to provide us with all of our energy needs 1 000 would be more than enough that 's everything all electric vehicles and electric heating in addition to the demands of the current power grid a carbon free society
those were their values all along they just captured the religious nuts so that they would n't have to pretend to care about everyone 's votes anymore
yes ca n't watch the movie a civil action again because the point is that the epa came in and saved the day and if anyone thinks things are bad now just wait see if you know who wins in november just wait to see what new supreme court appointees congress will do then it 's literally like we have turned the clock back 50 to 70 years on every bit of progress as a civil society and a first world country
100 % this the modern gop has very little in common with the historic gop because they have transitioned into an autocratic faux populist party
to be fair the abortions are unproven but if she had needed one or did actually have one i would have defended her right to do that i would also have zero problems with her doing sex work it ’s just her hypocrisy i would have a problem and even though some of these allegations are potentially false she is still a person of low morals and a hypocrite of epic proportions it ’s not the alleged sex work or abortions that make her despicable it ’s just her in general
hypocrisy is the root of all maga
so the job she did at the beetlejuice theatre did n’t count as sex work
maga does n’t care either way as long as they can wallow in their cess pit of ignorance and conspiracy
exactly what she does with her body is absolutely her business and no one else ’s her mouth is the issue also obligatory fuck her
obviously it 's about her hypocrisy and all the damage she has done misrepresenting herself and how she has preached to her followers about the supposed failings of those she deems to be evil when she is the evil one for doing so and i do n't mean the sex work etc p s this article and the headline is questionable
she did n’t get paid for that it was a charity performance for the children
her mind is the issue
you mean the debate might not have been the doom crisis fiasco apocalypse the headlines would have us believe
still voting for him no question
i do n’t care about his debate performance he ’s still the only candidate that will defend democracy from the maga fascists and get the scotus repaired after mitch ’s steals
joe ai n't goin anywhere jack
good money after bad he lied when he said he would be a one term president an intervention is necessary if dems want to win
imagine what the fundraising would have looked like if he did well i 'm not sure this is exactly amazing news it was a major campaign event fundraising always spikes after a major campaign event
it ’s almost like the media ’s profits are directly tied to people thinking biden is gon na lose
joe ’s got ta go our choices ca n’t be between an old man who ’s going senile and a convicted criminal
nah he has my vote and i am not even a democrat maga shit the bed with former guy no amount of stuttering will push my vote to former guy
he has n't lied he may very well be a one term pres
lol if democrats did n't want joe then they would nt be donating at such a high rate
then people should stop donating to him instead of having the biggest day of donations
vote the ticket there will always be kamala harris
it was a case of “ you can get with this or you can get with that ” us politics has somehow managed to take the choice out of even a 2 party system
not sure what your point is did you just figure out how the office of vice president works and this year for the first time ever i am voting an all blue ticket most of my friends are doing the same and they are all hard r 's they hate biden and are still voting for him over biden people are tired of toxic behavior
there were over 20 choices in 2020 political leaders do n't challenge their party 's incumbent year and for good reason they do n't want to waste their shit or be alienated from the party there will be a ton of choices again for 2024 if we can win this year and insure elections happen in 2028
where the hell was this biden yesterday i was watching part of the rally and he is vibrant and stringing coherent sentences together link to full rally
where the hell was this energy at last night when it really mattered
47 million people watched that debate like it or not that will be the public 's impression of biden these rallies will not move that needle
so where the fuck was this joe and the state of then union joe did his staff tell him to tame it down on purpose and take the so called high road
trump is worried about alleged rapists coming over the southern border the rest of us are worried about the convicted trump tower rapist who will ravage america
millions of americans do n’t give af what ’s said they just want it said with confidence and vigor the debate was cringeworthy af i ’ll still vote for non trump but the whole time i ’m just thinking “ do n’t die before the election ”
we know joe wtf happened to you yesterday it made me question who exactly is running the executive branch
i can see the onion article now trump commits 1000 crimes to blame biden for higher crime rates
the thing is nobody cares about these rallies irreparable damage was done last night biden 130 before the debate odds now are 400 on betting sites newsom is 500 he is a heavy underdog you know shit is bad when the guy not even running has almost the same chance as you
he seems awake and alive he needs to out front like this for the next 4 months
hardly one man there 's a whole fucking cabal that 's helping him commit crimes lookin at you cannon alito thomas roberts and the entire party of treason
not even close trump has plenty help
this election is once again not about who you ’re voting for but who you ’re voting against neither of these cadavers should be an option
should have brought that up during the debate
no joe he has an army of criminals that do n't see themselves as having committed any crimes
99 9 % certain he had a teleprompter at this rally he 100 % had the teleprompter at the sou last night he did n’t it showed and his camp is paying dearly for it unfortunate night for america to see our president like that
old man yells at clouds
man that was a terrible performance and put an age limit on political offices now
does he address what the trillionaires are paying i m interested to here about this genuinely curious
looks like he prepared more for the day after rally than he did the actual “ debate ” aka q a
yeah man he has all the le epic quips now what a fucking joke dnc needs to serve a purpose other than anointing these people and losing to an orange gameshow host
he told more lies last night than you could find in a beijing phone directory
idc stuff was cheaper when trump was president
bottom line is biden do n’t know what state he ’s in and he is in capable of being president
pretty sure biden had a cold yesterday idk how much that affected his debate performance either way biden looks and sounded better today teleprompter or not
if biden had slept through the entire debate i 'd still vote for him over trump i 'd vote for a card board cut out of biden over trump you need to understand the president is more of a figure head than a useful role he ca n't do anything on his own except moving troops around all you want in a president is someone who is n't crazy and likely to start a war that is all you need his aides take care of most things for him he 's just a decision maker and has lots of people helping him make those decisions but he ca n't really pass any laws himself executive orders have narrow reaches and that is all he can do
the debate was held past most 80 year olds bedtime he was also debating trump who thinks people are aborting babies after birth and believes in putin ’s dream
i watched it he knocked it out the park but the damage is already done watch the media okay none of this
i agree and he was so different even at a watch party after the debate
if he has a cold anyone that has had one knows that symptoms get worse at night my guess is that ’s part of it and also that most 80 year olds are n’t at their most energetic from 9 pm to 10 30pm so a daytime rally is a much better time slot for him
so the good news about this video is that i now feel a lot better about the whole biden had a cold thing he was pale as a ghost and breathing with his mouth open fair enough same for most of us i just hope the damage is n't already done last night is what the trump team had been hoping for and i am disgusted that they got what they wanted
he had a cold which seems to have slowed him down and today he did n’t have to waste time refuting 45s bullshit the campaign should have him go out and do a bunch of these rallies especially with july 4 coming up
i honestly think the lack of an audience probably did biden a disservice it had the opposite effect they wanted on trump who seemed more even keeled than normal with his deployment of lies these guys get to this level by getting energy from crowds
sick plus he did a before event and a small after event dude 's pretty busy plus running the nation in the background meetings intel the like
he 's fine with a teleprompter reading a speech it 's under pressure without notes that caused him to fail last night was really hoping to hear him announce retirement today
he 's reading off a teleprompter at that rally it 's a lot harder to stutter or lose your train of thought when all you have to do is read the words in front of you
it was well past his bed time he ’s rarely allowed up past 7 30pm
the debate was 9 pm matlock was over and done with 3 hours prior probably ought to make all debates around 4 pm edt when he ’s still awake and yet he ’s clearly more active and in better shape at a rally earlier in the day
the damage has been done biden was at camp david preparing for last night for a week and totally shits the bed it is alarming to me that knowing how important last night was he would could totally fuck it up which really concerns me if he ’s capable of sound decision making if he ’s having a bad day senior moment
maybe it ’s just tough for an 80 year old man to fight after 9 pm trump is used to it because he usually stays up late for his amphetamine fueled toilet tweets and then usually rolls out of bed around 11 in the morning
meanwhile trump spends today in virginia doubling down on black jobs and hispanic jobs hannibal lecter electric planes and waterfront real estate opportunities if the sea levels rise
i see a trend biden is still good giving speeches but the moment he has to think on his feet his brain just does n't work that well anymore
until the convention he 's gon na have to drill that
and even more are seeing clips of the debate
the poll i saw gave biden a 1 % improvement after the debate so it does n’t seem like it hurt him plus biden got like 14 million in new donations afterwards much more than trump
not really most people who watch debates are already invested in who they ’re voting for a low information undecided voter is n’t going to toon into cnn at 9 pm on a thursday to hear policy questions albeit without answers from one side they probably did n’t even know about the debate
biden supports are so desperate it ’s insane “ oh he was totally better at a staged event ” it was very clear from the debate that he does not have it all together anymore he ’s way too old to be president i do n’t know how anyone in their right mind could look at biden and say “ yes that ’s the guy i want for president ” how is anyone actually supporting him
i 'm hoping that the first debate was just to set a low bar so he can do better in the next one i 'm not holding my breath but it 's a decent strategy
the rest of us meaning this echo chamber did you talk to americans about their thoughts on mass immigration have you checked the polls
do n't speak for everyone even though this sub is called politics it 's really just left wing politics only do n't be fooled by the echo chamber
pretty interesting that when the idea of drug tests comes up he shows up like my 95 year old drunk uncle but when testing is off the table the next day he is just fine just sayin
he should fake a serious illness and resign i ca n’t believe he is actually in charge right now
did you see him cough during the speech today i think he may have some sort of cold that would explain the huge difference between yesterday and today
i can see the onion the new republic article now trump commits 1000 crimes to blame biden for higher crime rates ftfy
i think citing betting sites designed to hook suckers is the wrong way to prognosticate about the impact of a presidential debate whose body is still warm
bull shit we see article after article and video after video of trump 's rallies for years the media reports on them biden 's debate was a disaster but if he can string together some seriously powerful rallies like he did today and follow up with a strong performance at the next debate no one will remember this one but he has no more room for error these rallies can help show the debate was a fluke not his new normal
got ta use the campaign speach clips and post to social media it ’s what trump team is doing
oh yes betting sites a much better indicator of things than reality
nobody cares about the debates either
i swear there is some dark force enjoying tormenting the shit out of regular folks like of all the days grandpa needed to pay attention was yesterday and he gets the flu
every president uses a teleprompter do you think he 's the only one
trump started rambling when his teleprompter stopped working
what are you even talking about
not after his horrible tariffs they are over half the reason for inflation but his moron cultists do n't understand that they have to pay for tariffs not china
you can see evidence that he still is recovering from the cold in today 's rally he was coughing quite a bit but definitely sounds like he 's getting over it
his team said that he had a cold and he ’s always struggled with debates personally i ’m not judging my vote on last night ’s debate because we have four years of experience with both of these candidates in office so i know that biden is the better choice whether he ’s a good public speaker or not
yeah he sounded rougher than normal so that 's a lot of sense he had a cold hell i just had a cold a few days ago and i just lay on the couch trying to rest and get better fuck having to deal with a debate
i think he was nervous and freezing up i would assume in part because of his stutter there was way more pressure then and an opponent
sun downing happens at random source my grandpa has the same thing some days he was coherent at 6 pm some days he needed to be restrained at 4 pm or he would walk out the house in his underwear another day he 's eating a seafood dinner at an upscale restaurant recalling his childhood dog we need whitmer or newsom asap
he was also having to a deal with a pathologically lying man baby
i did n't even watch the debate because i could give a fuck voting biden is the only option
yes same my fear is about how his performance went over with those on the sidelines whom we need to motivate to vote we needed them to see biden like he is here at the rally or during sotu
i 'd vote for a cardboard cutout over trump too but that 's not the question in front of us we have to decide who we think could defeat trump in november if the cardboard cutout has the greatest chance fine i 'm on board
saying the president of the united states likely the most powerful man in the world is just a figure head is very strange if the president is apparently meek and powerless how is trump such a threat in the role
politics on the scale of the presidency is 80 90 % optics i 'd guess biden 's optics are in the dirt right now
you ’re crazy for saying you want an incompetent elderly man to be the “ figurehead ” for our country because you ’re scared of the orange man i ’d rather have someone who knows what they ’re doing and where they ’re at literally knows where they ’re at with biden then having the presidents aides make all the decisions get real
i 'd vote for a card board cut out of biden over trump good for you i 'll be voting trump may the best man win
trump does n’t believe anything he says he just says things he knows will rile up his supporters
i ’m sorry but that ’s not how this works all the eyes were on him last night and deserves to raked through the coals for the bed shifting performance people are impressionable and my family of hardcore democrats are all extremely concerned on what we just saw they need a new candidate
that 's a bad argument a president should be able to perform any time day and night
he was pale as a ghost he looks so much different from yesterday to today and the cnn after show was so lopsided against him that i honestly have to wonder if cnn intentionally made him more pale through lighting or video effects
there was 0 % chance that the president of the united states of america was going to wake up today and announce retirement because of a bad debate showing i have to assume you ’re trolling
that is not true he is at his best improvising his direct concerned self he was over prepared sick and constrained last night sounds like an excuse i suppose but i believe it to be true
hell i 'm 59 and in bed by 9 30 and asleep by 10 if there is another debate it needs to be in the daytime i had trouble staying awake last night
considering the presidency is kinda a 24 7 job maybe we should run someone who can have their wits about them more or less no matter the time of day that seems like the bare minimum to me
also it ’s impossible for anyone to debunk the firehose of trumps lies in just a minute or two the debate format was unfortunate yeah biden agreed to the terms and should have known that trump has the ability to vomit lies at rapid fire i do n’t blame biden for having a hard time trying to set the record straight while trump just keeps smearing feces all over the studio and i ’m pretty sure trump actually shit himself while talking about the tariffs on china the only live mic at the time was trump ’s and it sounded like a wet one
his people could book him for the full hour on a bunch of the sunday talkies if he wanted to do it and he should
the conventions are mostly watched by partisans who 've already made up their minds the debates draw in the normies
more invested than those who go to a rally
you used toon and cnn in the same sentence it 's fitting
trump is n’t going to agree to another debate
do you really believe there are millions of criminals insane asylum patients and terrorists crossing the border
yes all these people living hundreds of miles from the border who can probably count on one hand the number of spanish speaking people they ’ve ever met definitely have a valid reason to be worried about immigrants coming to do jobs no one else wants to do
the mass immigration that is only of concern during an election year
so you deny trump raped e jean carroll
it is centrist at best
in the medical community it is called sundowning
the lines move based on public opinion and what the public thinks is going to happen the odds makers are n't just making these odds up or they would lose a lot of money which they do n't
no one will remember this one you think the right will let this go you do n’t think fox and all the others will play clips of sleepy joe all the way up to election night i know i would if i were them the trump camp will never agree to another debate because it could n’t have gone better for them than to have this as the public ’s image of the two men debating shit if i were fox i ’d do a rerun of the whole debate the day before the election just to give everyone a refresher seriously if the democrats wants to win this they need to bring their a game and not wishful thinking this is not the time to gamble also that whole “ cold ” thing does n’t help the narrative at all imo you ca n’t have a president that gets that affected by a cold when it ’s vital he stays sharp it also just proves he is n’t the right guy for the job for reference look at debate between romney and obama obamas performance was considered a disaster at the time that ’s how far the democrats have sunken into some weird fetishization of joe biden the dems must let him go and look at this as an opportunity to turn the whole political discourse around by finding someone that can control the conversation and inspire people
a great indicator of things actually
in this case that ’s not true many americans already had concerns about biden ’s mental fitness before the debate those concerns have been reinforced in spectacular fashion
they did about this one this was the moment t for biden to show general election voters the age attacks were bullshit he failed at that and made it worse i mean for fucks sake biden pivoted away from his strongest issue abortion to his weakest issue immigration
1 4 americans watched the debate or have seen clips many of the rest will see the commentary or narrative he 's cooked
is that why there was such a massive betting odds shift after last night
he did really well in the paul ryan debate but that was different and debating someone who gish gallops is a difficult task anyway the only way to counter it is to speak really forcefully similar to like how bill nye debated the guy from aig
that ’s just simply not true go skim through the 2020 trump vs biden debate and it ’s an absolute night and day difference in the biden that was there vs this one
biden never struggled in a vice presidential debate i ’d vote for him any day over a maga cultist but dems need to wake the fuck up the old guard needs to move on
deal with a debate while also doing the job of president and actually doing the job not just golfing like the other guy
this assumes that whitmer or newsom wants to do that and also that they would perform better we do n't know either of those talking about biden stepping down is real easy when the other option is imaginary
as a memory care nurse biden demonstrates being a man in his 80 ’s with a neurological condition stuttering but cognitively intact trump with his repetitive rambling looks like the sun downer
chill the administration is on point that ’s what matters it ’s not just about the figurehead it ’s about the 4000 people that are in the administration have you seen what ’s happening in the supreme court a vote for republicans is a vote against the environment women ’s rights and civil rights
they ca n’t run whitmer or newsom when you ’ve made your party the champion of women and african americans you can not take the female african american sitting vice president and just discount her
sun downing dr brianching25 i could be wrong but i do n’t think he ’s been diagnosed with that
yeah either one of them would have crushed trump last night it 's time if biden stays he 's going to rbg us into a second trump term
newsom did n’t sound great when he debated desantis sounded like kerry ii
i watched something equally as anxiety inducing the new season of the bear
voting biden is the only option nah
yes my opinions on biden and trump have not changed i know their policies i paid attention during their presidential terms i know their characters and i understand what the presidency is and is not my concern is how many low propensity voters or undecided voters are making decisions purely based on feel and appearance frankly those folks are morons who have failed to perform the due diligence required to make an informed decision according to their civic responsibilities the future of our nation rests squarely on the shoulders of the apathetic and uninformed i ’m concerned biden ’s debate performance will harm voter turnout efforts amongst those demographics
the people on the sidelines are n’t watching the debates
this election is about more than anything else abortion not biden all the electoral results and their delta to polls for the last couple of years are telling us this biden is not a great debater maybe even not a great candidate full stop but he has huge tailwinds why sputter up the airplane engine with the major drama of replacement
i ’m gon na be honest i was seriously doomposting this morning i seriously wanted another candidate if biden stays it is what it is there is enough time between now and november for biden to still win this shit but yesterday did him no favors and is likely going to turn a neck and neck race into an uphill battle
what interesting is at least some focus groups i ’ve been seeing about generally had the view of “ biden struggled but the other guy is fucking insane ” so that ’s a silver lining at least
it 's not good for us speak for yourself dude
a cardboard cut out should be able to beat trump if the dumbass democrats would stop worrying and fighting with each other long enough to form a united front and vote for that cut out
same reason they are saying they 'll pick a comatose biden over trump who and what comes with them
because trump is weak and stupid and therefore easily manipulated through flattery and shiny things it 's why putin targeted him way back same for china and the saudis
the rub is n’t that the president ca n’t be to sole seat of the executive power it is that the president does n’t have to be the seat biden is a better choice because his goals are to make the country better and he has surrounded himself with people to do that the axiom a good leader has the best advisors trump is a danger because he does n’t listen to anything except that which feeds his ego or his bank account and every advisor around him will be chosen to reinforce this goal regardless of the national impact
because the people around him are putting all those horrible judges draconioan laws into place which are literally going to be affecting your life for the next 50 years how is this so hard to see
because trump wants to fire everyone in the executive branch and government employees up to 20 000 people and replace them with rabid cult members then he will get to nominate hundreds more federal judges that are loyal to him
optics do n't matter it 's about saving the country a vote for trump is a vote against democracy and this country you may feel ok with voting for a felon and a traitor but i 'm willing to bet the vast majority of people are not
trump does n't know what he 's doing though he 's also a felon con man sexual predator liar and he 's bad at golf and fat and lazy i 'd rather have a former senator over trump any day of the week trump is a loser and a sucker as biden said last night
you do n't have to concede this early
it ’s too late he should never have been a presumptive nominee let alone run last time but it ’s way the fuck too late now
perform what a debate why why would it matter if the president could debate effectively anytime of day or night if he can make decisions effectively any time day or night that ’s all he needs to be able to do he has done that clearly since his presidency is a success i do n’t think it ’s important that the president can be awoken at 2 am and win a debate
he was n't right during the debate as soon as i saw him i verbally went oh shit that 's the biden they have been painting him as we need a little dark brandon
i have to assume you ’re trolling no i 'm not i 'm just convinced that biden is going to lose to trump i 've believed that for two years i was hoping he would retire to improve the chances of beating trump
was over prepared oh come on we ca n't keep making excuses for his brain farts
lol over prepared i 'll keep that in my back pocket as an excuse the next time i fumble the bag bigtime
he was at his best like that once he no longer does events like that is it because he wants to lose or because he no longer can
no one can be aware 24 7 no one
not yet they do n’t there ’s a long time between here and the general
they already agreed to two but if he ’s smart then he pulls out now he ’s ahead
there are too many the situation is out of control
and the same one which biden passed a bill for and republicans refused to pass
like i said that 's because you 're in an echochamber people have been talking non stop about it for years it 's out of control
yeah her story was ridiculous do you deny biden raped tara reade or that he showered with his daughter
the odds are to protect the bookie from losing money if just one punter bets a large wager the odds are adjusted one rich gambling person is not reflective of the public
those same betting sites that had trump odds up until overnight when the mail in ballots came in and helped with starting the election being stolen framing because people were losing money on what they thought was a sure win those betting sites
they had trump winning in 2020 all the way until it was clear biden was going to win
how many people are actually not voting because of what happened last night are people really still on the fence at this point it ’s been 8 years of all of this mess in one way or the other
ditto with trumps narcissistic crazy man persona
not great but i doubt it moves the numbers much we will see in a week
also i think he did fine he was slow halting and old that said he still has better policy and trump alienated a lot of latinos with his racist rhetoric substance matters
people gambling will gamble on anything in a bid to win big they saw biden did n’t perform so well and took a punt on a change of candidate it ’s not reflective of the vote gambling agencies odds are often wrong
nobody is going to be clamoring to replace biden if biden decides to drop out it will be a somber moment and a huge historical decision to make to jump into the race and biden ’s rallying today is very much declaring he is not dropping out
i love biden but it ’s hard not to imagine either whitmer or newsom would n’t do better than last night
newsom is definitely thinking about the presidency
stuttering but cognitively intact yeah no
i fully recognize that you have much more experience with this type of thing than myself but in your professional experience would you really just call that stuttering
exactly it would have to be kamala and so it ’s best to just stick with biden since she ’ll take over anyways if he ’s seriously too old or dies
salty af homie we are on the same team i want dems to win i just want it to be whitmer or newsom to do it
true they likely did n't sit there watching the whole thing however they 're now being bombarded with clips from the debate where biden did so poorly on tv and online in addition to all the discussion sadly this performance got broadcast wider than any of his others except maybe the sotu
i 'm very cautiously optimistic it was a bit of a relief to hear and i 'm hoping this is more widespread among the independents undecideds hoping for more reassuring news in the coming weeks with polling
whether we rally behind a cardboard cutout or not has no effect on whether that cutout wins the election what drives turnout among marginal voters is how much they are excited by the possibility of that candidate winning and afraid of them losing
sure that 's important but so is having a president with good communication skills who can speak both to the public and foreign leaders yes as is always obvious trump is worse but we should n't overlook the importance of a leader who is younger and can communicate even without his advisors
that 's not a figurehead though that 's a lot of power
right which is a very powerful position and not just a figurehead someone who controls the judiciary like that is a useful role unlike what the op suggested
i 'm voting blue no matter who here 's the issue with biden though he is right now depressing enthusiasm it might drive you crazy to think that people need to be enthused to vote to save democracy but they do
we 're not talking about voting for trump we 're talking about voting for whoever can defeat trump after last night 's performance i fear biden may not be that person
like the other guy said you 're missing the point of this thread it 's not about not voting democrat it 's about whether someone with biden 's cognitive issues should be on the ticket obviously i 'm voting for biden because i like him and his administration has been great but that does n't mean he 's the right candidate part of being president is projecting strength and conviction to sell your achievements and he is n't able to do that he has clear medical issues he 's 81 it 's wrong on many levels
lol biden needs to be in a retirement home i ’m personally all for rfk who got snubbed and should ’ve been up there last night but i ’d vote for trump over biden any day biden does n’t even know where he is most of the week
you taken a look at the vegas odds recently
then we ’re fucked independents are n’t gon na back whatever the fuck that was
so you 're out in the streets of reddit shilling for the pants shitter who cnn propped up gtfoh
no that is actually a reason why you can fail it can lead to stress and overthinking in biden ’s case it led to his stuttering
what about 24 7 awareness man
yes they do 47 million people watched at least some of the debate the dem convention pulled 21 million in 2020 and the rep one pulled 19 million amd before you say aha those two numbers add up to the 40 millions there is likely lots of overlap between those two audiences for the conventions
trump is n't ahead unless you 've changed your plan to vote i 'm still voting for biden
so you are just going to sit here and blatantly lie
he started a wild fire and is pouring cups of water on it
it 's only out of control because fox news says it 's out of control keep repeating their talking points word for word
her story convinced a jury now did n't it
that 's like saying the same betting sites that favored the falcons to win when they were up 28 3
i 'm still voting for biden because the dnc wo n't nominate anyone else biden was just supposed to get us past trump and then ride off into the sunset now that trump is running just to stay out of prison we have to vote like it 's 2020 all over again
dedicated voters the vote blue no matter who crowd would always vote for him it 's the non voters and independents dumb as they are who he has to win over and that debate performance is n't going to do that democrats need to fucking understand they need candidates that people want to vote for they ca n't continually rely on voters showing up election after election to vote against the republican that 's why people flocked to trump it 's why bernie 's rallies were massive you need to inspire and energize voters saying yeah i may not be all there anymore but the other guy is a criminal is a losing message
he did awful on substance and should be replaced to avoid trump 2 0
they may do better in public speaking during debates but they may do worse at the ballot box
cool one debate does not an election make
your credentials i ’ve worked in direct patient care for 15 years caring for many varieties of patients including memory care and assisted living care where we step people into memory care as they decline but ok your yeah brah nah ’ probably outweighs my over a decade of experience let ’s see you can click here and read about stuttering you can read here about numerous famous people including royalty and politicians who have overcome stuttering or you can just shrug your shoulders and believe your wrong opinion ta eta i also regularly administer the standardized tests required for assisting in a diagnosis of dementia vs neurological conditions but please do tell me how nah bran ’ proves anything
i would call it stuttering at his age many people can be fully cognitively intact and have great difficulty with making their thoughts known especially when the person next to them is a constant stream of bull and repeating the same thing over and over eta stumbling over words etc is quite common with aging especially with a lifelong neurological condition like stuttering trump ’s repetitive language is more indicative of dementia
vice presidents matter harris is going to have to do some heavy lifting in her own debate
i get it but it does n’t help posting stuff that probably is n’t true just sick of random shit getting spread around and i am salty but sometimes things need to be called out
i consider myself plugged in and i did n’t watch it only saw jon stewart ’s response to it which yeah it was n’t great but whatever i think most people will likely remember the shitty 4 years of trump
you need to vote for biden or shut up and admit you are helpiing trump win these are your choices he 's not dropping out or being replaced the top democrats have rallied behind him his campaign said he 's not going anywhere and he made more money today than any previous day of his campaign you are the delusional one and you need to stop posting
sorry i was being explanatory on how he could be successful he is already in office and imo currently better with both communication skills and foreign leaders than trump was in his four year sample he is not the best but may be the only electable democrat at the moment he ran last time because all the alternatives were too liberal to win in a general election we are getting a second trump or a second biden term no need to ask a hypothetical question here they both have massive track records and everyone knows exactly what these terms represents we have never had two candidates with such a long history nor such divisive future for the country i ca n’t understand who the age thing is such a big deal given the other facts here
that ’s not something biden struggles with though biden is perfectly capable of making decisions wielding power and hiring people he has very strong values even if he sucks at communicating them
lol this has to be some bot
no we are talking about a vote for biden or trump those are your choices he 's not dropping out you do n't have another choice wake up to reality stop being naive you do n't get to choose candidates because you are unhappy you vote for your party 's candidate and you do it with a smile that is how american politics works obviously you are young and have n't figured this out if you are a republican and vote for trump you are also a traitor to the country a vote for trump is endorsement of a traitor
his cognitive abilities are fine he looked fine today at a rally you are just a pathetic member of the democratic party or an undercover republican shill biden is fit enough to be president way more than trump is suck on these eggs and stop replying with your brain rot comments
no one cares what you want if you do n't vote for biden no one literally cares stop talking now
cool so you want to vote for a convicted felon and adjudicated rapist who said he would be dictator on day one you 're the one that 's lost bud
i 'm not a gambling loser so probably not
we are fucked i only hope that independents and young people regret their decision when they ’re being marched to the work camps
at least it 's not the most important job on the planet then oh wait
haha i 'll use this too as an excuse these are helpful keep 'em coming
it was n’t just stuttering he talked like he had marbles in his mouth looked and sounded drifting
where was he when my kids were newborns could 've used his help
and 154 million voted in the general partisans and political junkies watch this stuff this early this will have impact but as a whole americans have the memory of a goldfish this was n’t good for biden but there ’s lots of time left this news cycle will be over when trump is sentenced if it was october this would matter a lot more
what 's a lie that almost 10 million people have illegally entered america during biden 's presidency with no a background check that many of them are convicts and fleeing criminals wanted in their countries now freely walking in american streets
have you even read about the types of illegal immigrants who are coming across the border they are n’t just from mexico neither isis has been sending people into the united states as well
i do n't watch fox news very few people i discuss these issues with do were n't you moments ago claiming no one is concerned
cause jurys ca n't have bias huh and just ignore my questions i guess
disagree he defended abortion rights he stood up for veterens he supports democracy he proposes a legitimate progressive tax if anything he erred by putting too much substance and not enough personal attacks
maybe i ca n’t argue that that ’s not a possibility but i would really be surprised if whitmer did n’t sweep the rustbelt and that ’s all she would really need biden and trump are tied there in polls
i fully recognize that you have much more experience with this type of thing than myself and taking at face value that you are being truthful am not going to go out of my way to make a sideways contradiction of what you stated masked as a question like the poster you 're replying to and thanks for your work had two grandparents go through some hard times before they passed one during covid when we could n't be with her much and so i appreciate what you do
man i hope they remember and also understand the threats to our rights with him in office i see way too much of people stating how things were cheaper under him and failing to remember it was due to the pandemic p s wish i had only watched jon 's coverage i did not need those 90 minutes of panic
i 've already explained that i 'm voting for anyone but trump in november if that 's biden fine i 'll vote for him but my vote has zero effect on whether marginal votes in swing states will vote for biden
well communicating them really is an important part of being president
everyone here is voting if you think you 're convincing anyone to vote by posting on this subreddit you are wasting your time we are talking about the americans who do nt pay attention to politics and how they are likely going to react to biden 's performance last night they will have likely heard it said biden is too old and then when they see the clips from last night they 'll likely agree with that
aka i refuse to look at anything that does nt fall in line with my narrative that i want to believe
over preparing is a coping mechanism that is used to handle anxiety however it leads to people to only increase their anxiety as they come in contact with the very thing that it creates the anxiety when people over prepare it usually causes them to miss on important sleep and relaxation i never studied the day before a big exam it never helps
he was one of your newborns that 's why they never took naps
thx for fighting the corner you 're doing good work
40 million out of 150 is a huge number you ca nt simply downplay that and the 110 million that did not watch it live are going to see clips and shippets
tom what kinda chinese are you cotton is the dog whistling moron conflating these figures and anyone falling for it is ignorant or just simply a racist also parroting the republicans racist border bullshit was the dumbest move the democrats ever did because multiple studies have shown immigration is ultimately a boon for the economy so fuck racist tom cotton and fuck the democrats for capitulating to this obscenely stupid narrative because you end up getting people like the one i 'm replying to who are scared of a made up boogeyman
but trump claims he completely destroyed isis so either trump is lying or whoever told you that is lying
because juries tend to be unbiased and undermining them because you do n't like the result is not a good look prove it was biased second if you are so against biden you would think you would be against trump here too oh yea in may 2023 reade said she had defected to russia during an interview with sputnik in moscow alongside maria butina whom she called her friend butina had previously been convicted of being an unregistered russian agent in the united states and said that she asked vladimir putin personally to accelerate reade 's russian citizenship request
newsom no way but i would take whitmer in a heartbeat
the thing is too i literally hate defending biden but there is far too much at stake this year to allow a demented fascist to take over trump is parroting what the federalist society is training him to say to attract scared white people in the midwest this is n’t a professional opinion but it tracks and you are welcome the work i do is difficult but i do love it
are you really going to deny your own two eyes and ears the man ’s brain is mush
that 's your uninformed decision no one is going to vote for a traitor and convicted felon because they think biden is old you must be a teenager
sure bud waste your money on gambling i 'm sure you 'll win eventually if you keep trying
excellent this is also helpful to add to my excuses
i knew there was something going on
so that 's proof tara was lying i just think people are so ready to investigate trump and assume he 's guilty and then deflect anything against the left
whitmer 2028 to continue the run of democratic leadership to undo the damage of the orange red presidency and restore the scrotus dignity
i 'm a gal of very complicated opinions but i 'm also one that 's pretty tired today of seeing people get bullied trolled and shit talked for trying to add polite constructive commentary to a reddit discussion take care
i 'd kindly ask you not to tell me what my own eyes and ears saw and heard thank you
i ’m not going to deny my experience working with the elderly for 15 years biden btw is a lifelong stutterer
noone is going to vote for someone who admitted to committing sexual assault noone is going to vote for someone who mocks disabled people noone is going to vote for someone who called mexicans rapists and murderers noone is going to vote for someone who called white supremacists fine people i wish i had your faith in the american people or their memories at least but i do nt tens of millions of americans did and will vote for him again
go look at the polls tommorow sweetheart
that person 's post reminds me of when that moron jason smith said you 'll never believe us maga is getting more and more desperate every day we get closer to the election this sub blew up with nothing but negative articles and comments about biden after like 10 minutes of the debate it was insane just article after article of hate so damn weird
she was proven inconsistent on major points biden also does n't have a track record of incidents the burden of proof would be lower if she was n't major off on significant points and was n't fiends with a known russian agent oh yeah and running to russia is n't a good look carroll did n't buddy up with a chinese agent and run to china now did she
i hope you have a great weekend
not trying to tell you how to think but there are people desperately trying to twist reality
that was n’t a stutter he spaced out and said he finally beat medicare before staring off into the distance while the moderators bailed him out his one job yesterday was to not look like a cadaver and he failed miserably
he lost the popular vote before he was a felon and traitor
look at this block right now darling have fun being a gamba addict
lets be honest both stories are pretty bogus carroll 's story is just nonsense the jury had to expand the definition of rape in order to find trump guilty basically saying they think he did something as little as groping her breasts but the sketchy part to me is how she was never emotional about anything and according to her she laughed after he kissed her never said stop and thinks rape is sexy oh and also wore her dress that it supposedly happened in on the cover of her book it seems more like she fantasized about trump and is jumping on a financial opportunity
biden could have shit himself on stage and i 'll still vote for him over someone who attempted to topple our democracy i can not stress how much i fucking hate trump for what he did
the thing is when obama had a bad debate with romney our first reaction was n’t that obama was old or cognitively declining everyone who has ever had an elderly parent or grandparent can see what ’s going on with joe people are concerned whether he will stay upright he looks old and lost it ’s sad bc he ’s too old for a job that requires a lot of mental fortitude this job turns your hair grey so imagine the toll it takes on an 80 year old man
obama had the luxury of debating against someone who did n't have a lie coming out of his mouth every 10 seconds and did n't speak like a 17 yr old internet troll i did n't particularly like romney because i disgreed with him on policy but he never spouting obscene lies and if he did he would have been rebuked immediately this is not the same our biggest mistake is minimizing the disaster acknowledge the disaster and commit to doing better and doing better right damn now
what ’s he supposed to say “ tonight was just a shit show michelle and i weep for the future of this nation ”
yeah they ’re really gon na pretend that biden did n’t take an entire week off from being president to prepare for this and still put in that performance gaslighting
that was n't a bad debate night we watched biden 's chances implode in real time
do n’t really remember too many obama debate downfalls however there was a really important speech he gave one time that was very serious in tone but i could not take it seriously as he had a whistler in his nose i just kept screaming blow your damn nose it was almost the same feeling in the debate he came out sounding hoarse and i kept screaming give that man a damn water clear your friggin throat while the mics muted so frustrating
there is bad and there is forgetting answers to women 's reproductive rights and health care halfway through
john mcafee yes that one tweeted in 2020 that “ russia ’s time traveler returned and has said that in september biden is declared mentally unfit for office and quits ” and then implies the dnc replaces him with michelle obama if that happens it should prove to everyone the “ elite establishment deep state ” is real guess we ’ll see also remember that mcafee was kinda unhinged albeit interesting and it is unclear if the tweet from 2020 was referring to september 2020 or a different september
you said “ we finally beat medicare ” it was worse than bad
cognitive decline only gets worse over time 1 year from now biden will be incoherent
the guy had no clue where he was could n't make a coherent statement and could barely make it down 3 steps with guidance
biden looked so different at the waffle house later and the rally today and if we ’re being honest it ’s called sputtering no one dealing with alzheimer ’s just wakes up one day with a fully developed case it comes in stages
they do happen so does getting old as fucking dirt
yup and felony conviction days happen too we got you joe keep up the good work and maybe we ’ll get more convictions along the way
even if we are headed towards biden dropping out this is still a good message show unity
if anyone in that party actually cared about this country they would 've been making plans after he was elected in 2020 the excuses they continue to make for him are n't that far off from what the republicans ignore with trump
he did n’t have a bad debate he had a night that demonstrated an inability to speak and think clearly in a way that undermines any confidence that he can perform the job of president
obama has to protect his legacy first and foremost you ca n't expect him to publicly come out and say anything that will rock the boat any conversation about biden stepping down will be done behind closed doors
losing in the election as well
“ good game sport you ’ll get em next time ” lookin ass
so how is he magically able to accomplish things and perform so well as the current president he clearly can be a good president at his age because he is already a good president at his age
additionally obama had positive approval ratings at this point in his presidency not highly positive but above 0 % having improved since the 2010 midterms while joe has approval ratings closer to 20 % than 10 % and obama 's debate performance was an unusual break from his normal cool charismatic reputation while biden 's debate performance just cemented common attitudes of him i maintain that if you listen to the substance of the debate biden actually did pretty well but it would be utterly absurd to act like that matters when we are talking about the popularity contest that is elections on the style front trump wiped the floor with biden and even if one argues biden 's style issues were really just due to a cold and his stutter i think there 's a decent case for that it 's kind of irrelevant to the political calculus
why exactly do people say that obama 's debate with romney was bad what makes you think that
the reality and more concerning thing is decisions with high cognitive load are shifted to unelected officials
doing better means stepping down for biden
this is such insane revisionism yes trump lies a greater percentage of the time because he appears to be fully disocnnected from reality but romney along with his cadre of necon advisers were all iraq invasion supporters additionally do not forget that romney was running for president during the surge which he was selling in a way no different from multiple administrations during vietnam that we could win and that the surge was an effort to improve the situation in iraq rather than a thinly veiled effort to make the invasion look like less of a disaster no one and i mean no one held these people to account for their lies about iraq a lot of people died but romney somehow has been revised into someone trustworthy because his lie was a bipartisan lie and trump 's lies are personal aggrandizement
i call upon my dear friend to make way for a candidate with a better chance of winning this crucial election for the democrats and step down to reflect on a life of service and a job well done that would be nice
what do you think obama said to biden at their debriefing
out of curiosity have there been any post debate polls yet edit turns out there have been a few already on the 28th it appears at least that right after the debate not much has changed might have to see polls in the next couple of days
obama had a bad debate against romney before wiping the floor with him in the final debate no matter what age you are it ’s exhausting to debate someone who lies with every sentence
yeah i ca n’t believe people are downplaying this the man could n’t put together a cogent sentence to save his life he could n’t underpin a single point without trailing off he effectively could n’t talk cold or no cold how can anyone have faith in this dude and this is coming from someone who is gon na vote for him
exactly bad debate nights are when you flub a comment leave my daughter out of your voice ’ or you give obviously incorrect numbers when defending your record or even if you 're a solid candidate it simply becomes clear your opponent is a gifted debater there are countless examples of that type of bad debate performance biden was exposed as everything the right claims there was already a valid concern whether biden can do another 4 year term the debate left everyone questioning whether he can even make it to the election
if people vote for a lying felon that audibly shits his pants on stage instead of biden because he fumbled his words we got some serious fucking problems in this country
that was my thought he is n't mentally fit to debate trump is n't either we are in a good spot s
please it 's june debates in june almost never have significant consequences we have no idea what 's going to happen between now and november but beyond that a lot of people thankfully understand that how eloquently he speaks has no bearing on his administration 's ability to get good things accomplished
what exactly is a whistler
america 's future in 2024 resides with the 230ish million eligible voters about a third of them wo n't bother to vote at all of those that do vote about a third can be counted on to vote for fascism about a third can be counted on to vote against fascism and the election outcome will be decided by the remainder who are neither for nor against fascism they will vote for whoever convinces them that they will personally financially benefit from electing that person
we also ca n't have a lying psychopath that will destroy democracy the lies coming out of his mouth were very disturbing right now we 're voting for an administration not any individual
truth step aside so someone with a fully working brain can win this thing
i truly do n’t get this take the dnc is not going to put another candidate forward at this point everyone knows it so the question is 4 more years of trump destroying america or 4 years of biden doing what ’s right this is n’t a difficult choice and it ’s astonishing that people ca n’t say that
because that 's what 's most important to america right now obama 's legacy
amateur pundits are filling up reddit with suppositions that have little to no basis in reality and some are doing so incessantly reality tells us that replacing or trying to replace an incumbent is bad take 1968 and 1980 for example and those events occurred during the primaries not afterward or take a look at 2012 or 2016 when there were hysterical calls for the candidate barack obama and then donald trump to drop out that were not heeded and both times the hysteria passed and the object of it got into power those two times there were significant poll drops this time we have n't even seen that yet and still panic sets in
yeah the substance and the message were pretty solid he ’s just the worst possible messenger someone with more energy and better debate skills even biden himself in his younger days could have picked apart trump ’s bullshit and run circles around him but instead we had to watch an old man get bullied on national tv the dnc is so bad at optics
polls overwhelmingly showed it at the time
subject matter experts are the ones that present presidents with options presidents are not competent to make actual policy on 90 % of what the government does and they do n’t actually have time to do it all even if they were so who ’s appointees would you rather have running the country
i do n’t disagree but i also do n’t know of any other person who can carry the rest of this election for the democrats other than michelle obama no one else is going to poll higher than trump or is capable of bringing in undecided voters
yeah obama should man up and tell biden its time to step aside he said he was going to be a one term president and despite what has happened since that is the best thing going forward i sincerely hope he wins if he stays in but i do nt think being stubborn like ginsburg and feinstein is in the best interest of the party or the country
republicans love all the hysteria because for one thing it is not possible to gain name recognition trust and public respect over just a few weeks the summer before an election and gop politicos certainly understand this even if democrats do not and this normal operation of u s politics is exacerbated to democrats ’ detriment by the fact that trump has a highly motivated even fanatical cult following that will definitely turn out to vote if democrats had a superstar with that sort of appeal they ’d already have made themselves known more things to consider here
publicly is not the place to do that successfully
do you recognize me you were my vp remember the black guy
“ i have a spare tan suit ”
now listen here joe if you do n't do something about this i 'm going to authorize a drone strike on the scranton steel mills
told him to consider dropping out but he wo n't listen so they have to tow the party line
everyone had already made up their minds
i just saw pollster frank luntz on cnn he said there wo n't be as much of a change as after previous bad debates because the number of undecided voters is so small he also said as things stand now trump will win trump is already slightly leading in key swing states and the debate will lock in that lead
trump can simply ignore a 2nd debate by saying you have seen enough i 'm not wasting my time they already hit biden the hardest they possibly could by going after age senility it 's enough that the calls to drop him are coming from inside the house trump does n't have anything to gain by doing a 2nd biden 's team will probably have a come to jesus about the last one and fix the mistakes only for there to be no debate to apply those fixes to so let 's say it becomes 2 hours of free press in a town hall format first it wo n't bring in the strangely undecided types the way a debate would 2nd the rs will just hold counter productions to divert ratings
this argument is silly trump ’s lying had nothing to do with biden locking up and forgetting where he was mid sentence on numerous occasions
he is currently the president nobody needs faith because we have evidence of the job he would do as president because he is currently doing it and has been for more than three years people keep talking like he is n’t already the president
he did a rally yesterday and sounded fine
he did n’t fumble his words he seemingly forgot where he was on numerous occasions
please it 's june debates in june almost never have significant consequences i think you 're very optimistic if you think this is n't going to have a continuing effect even if he has no more moments where he looks like a de bandaged mummy clips of this are going to be played over and over until november
whistle squeaks out your nose when you breathe
fascism gets tossed around so loosely that it ’s lost any real meaning how do you define it and give examples trying to control the media and social media seems fascist that ’s what the biden admin seemed to have been doing check out the twitter files and matt taibbi reporting on them he ’s not a right wing maniac he ’s a democrat journalist i say journalist and not a media sell out they majority of the media have been telling us for months that the right has been doing fake propaganda about joe biden he ’s not demolished he ’s sharp as a tack he ’s hard to keep up with he ’s so intense this is truly a show of real propaganda because we saw exactly where joe is mentally
unless of course they change their minds and do i 'm not sure your statement captures the situation correctly biden may lose to trump the debate made that more likely another candidate may have better odds at this point as well as be better at the job
reality tells us that replacing or trying to replace an incumbent is bad take 1968 and 1980 for example not necessarily its far from clear lbj would have been able to win if he ran again in 1968 and on the other hand humphrey ran a pretty damn good campaign and almost won and carter was deeply unpopular in 1980 so its very well possible that someone else would have done better than he did and were there actually significant calls for obama to drop out in 2012
obama did n't look like he was going to die during a presidential debate that 's an issue if you choose to ignore it then fine trump will win 2024 absolutely no doubts here terrible yes but you all created this mess
by amateur pundits i take it you mean potential voters
not enough we 're not going to stop calling for biden to step down until he does or he inevitably loses the election
i do n't even care what maga want let alone what some guy on substack thinks maga want none of those reasons are reasons to keep him currently someone nobody has heard of has a better chance of winning than biden the problem is people see exactly who biden is the fact that trump has such a loyal following is reason to run a stronger candidate not biden biden is currently an anti superstar
you voting for me cuz you ai n't black if you are n't voting for me
ok this gave me a good chuckle
hmm that statement has many implications what 's your confidence in that assessment
i do n’t know about that i watched the debate with my mom and she does n’t follow politics that much and she was a biden supporter until she watched the debate and said he was just too old and then said trump is an idiot she changed her mind into just not supporting or voting for anyone she just thinks america is doomed either way now and voting wo n’t help anything
you ’re right he ’s doing the job but it makes me question how much execution he is actually doing vs his people again i ’m voting for him because i believe the record speaks for itself but i just worry about how his performance would be in a crisis and his communication skills are put to the test
he was much better the next day but i still watched that biden in raleigh and thought he is too old to do another 4 years i 'm voting for biden if he 's in a coma on election day but i 'm sick of lying and saying he 's fine he 's not say the next world event happens china invades taiwan another covid 19 hits and we need to decide to close the borders etc who are we getting in the situation room debate biden or raleigh biden
i dunno i might lose my train of thought if i was hit with a biological weapon cloud and a torrent of bullshit have to admit that ’s a tactic a lot of self respecting politicians wo n’t use
right because we have n't had the internet replaying clips of candidates making asses of themselves or looking incompetent in every election for the last 15 years show me anything that has happened in june of any previous election that is generally accepted to have had a significant impact on the election and i might buy it but there 's a whole lot of evidence that the people who still have n't made up their minds do n't do so until just before the election and they do n't pay attention to things that happened in june
so in this fictional scenario another candidate now has less time to raise more money to campaign on the debate did n’t make a loss to trump more likely the undecided voter is ignorant and they ’ll fixate on a single issue israel for example again anyone not realizing that voting for trump is a path to a christo facist nation is dumb as fuck the debate was n’t necessarily we ’ve had 4 years of trump and 4 years of biden if the debate sways anyone they were never going to vote for him in the first place
nice try there but joe biden is about even and ever so slightly favored in 2024 against a guy biden already beat hubert humphey did in fact lose and to a fairly well known quantity even with the vote split three ways could lyndon johnson or jimmy carter have lost maybe so but we know for sure that democrats did lose the white house in both cases after serious challenges or changes bill clinton and barack obama did n't have those issues and they won the stats in the past few decades are perfectly against your punditry
who is you all your imagined enemies people who disagree with the absurd suggestion that joe biden looked like he was going to die donald trump likes to imagine enemies too you 're definitely not one of those i saved your comment trump will win no qualifications not even on your pet project of trying order joe biden to step down to create fights between those who would oppose donald trump will check back
by amateur pundits i mean people who apparently know a few things about politics but go on to defy history and current facts to claim they know what everyone else is thinking that is sometimes a trick used to convince people of a position it 's called band wagoning in this case the position being promoted is ' do n't support the nominated candidate and the current incumbent '
but you ’re not running for president also joe biden in 2020 did n’t lose his train of thought he utilized the opportunity to go after him you ca n’t seriously watch that performance and say “ nothing to see here ” with any level of credibility
right because we have n't had the internet replaying clips of candidates making asses of themselves or looking incompetent in every election for the last 15 years you are massively downplaying what happened the other night joe biden looks like he probably wo n't be alive at the end of his term he looks like he ca n't take care of himself anymore if he was my dad i 'd be getting professional carers involved this is n't just some verbal flub or using an outdated term for something and they do n't pay attention to things that happened in june this is like the will smith slap the president looking like the nurse needs to change him for 90 minutes of national television one of the most surreal most of american tv history also staunch allies are publicly calling for him to step down they ca n't just go back on that that 's going to keep being a story to say nothing of the fact that there is no way in hell this is the last time he looks like he 's wandering around lost
joe biden is about even and ever so slightly favored in 2024 against a guy biden already beat it has been over 9 months since biden has led in polling averages the electoral college also means that biden probably needs to not only win the popular vote but win it by around 3 points if he 's to win also both of the past elections with trump on the ballot saw polling underestimating support for trump biden is not favored to win at all also the matter of a bruising primary is kind of irrelevant if the incumbent acknowledges his own massive weaknesses and drops out of his own accord
as opposed to someone like yourself who thinks precedents from 45 years ago a time prior to the 24 hour news cycle let alone social media provides compelling evidence for why an incredibly weak candidate should stay in the race
you want a toh i can get you a toh i can get you a toh by 3 o ’ clock
trump does n’t even attempt to answer the question he is asked how is that any better we have two options one is a fascist who habitually shits in his pants sexually assaults women and commits fraud in every possible aspect of his life the other is kind of old and does n’t have the best debate skills not a hard choice for me personally
you 're not wrong it looked real bad
this is biden 30 min after the debate we do n’t know why he had a weird debate but he ’s clearly not sundowning or having a dementia moment or anything like that he had a bad night that ’s just what it was
reality biden is ever to slightly favored in 2024 right now biden is actually up now compared to months ago not down now you are wrong on both counts reality in recent years polls have understated democrats not republicans apparently in efforts to make up for what happened earlier in your outdated information reality history frowns upon replacing candidates see 1968 and 1980 and smiles upon keeping those being ordered to step down 2012 and 2016 reality replacing joe biden by insiders defies the people 's wishes since biden won the primaries thus a suggestion that there would be a bruising primary at this late date in entirely wrong your punditry is based on incorrect facts as it must be to reach your conclusion reminds me of trying to discuss supply side economics with a republican you are that wrong this deep into the thread probably nobody else is reading think about the realities i 've covered and try to adjust your views to base them on the facts rather than rushing to the downvote button thank you
you can scroll back on this very thread and see that i mentioned history of various times far more recent than 45 years ago and even some current stuff so you just made that up at least try to have a fair conversation anyway here 's some good analysis about the suggestion to replace the incumbent and nominee in 2024 for anyone else diving this deep in the thread
not a hard choice for me either i love joe biden and think he is an amazing president but the election wo n’t be decided by people like us it will be decided by people who ’s first interaction with this years campaign was that debate and joe biden looked like the sum of all fears
this is biden 30 min after the debate not that he does n't look pretty ancient there also but what is this supposed to prove that he only looks like he should be wandering around in a hospital gown at 2 am some of the time we do n’t know why he had a weird debate what on earth are you talking about this is like scientology levels of disengenuity we know exactly why he had a weird debate it 's because he 's 5 000 years old 98 % of the planet admits that but yet there is still this attempt at gaslighting but he ’s clearly not sundowning or having a dementia moment or anything like that i do n't think that 's clear at all but that does n't matter specific diagnosis are n't important the problem is he looks like a disaster him talking is a disaster him running is a disaster and all gaslighting people will do is make them laugh at you and then re elect trump
forecasts are n't polls they are predictions if you look at the trump leads by about 2 points and biden has n't led since september of last year also special elections are different from presidential elections there 's a case to be made that dems have switched things up to where they now have the advantage in low turnout elections due to turning the suburban educated voters who turn out more but presidential elections are the biggest elections we have the ones most likely to get even those least likely to turn out to do so and in every presidential election where trump has been on the ballot he 's overperformed polls also even in midterms the 2022 midterm polling was basically just right on the dot rather than underestimating the dems and if biden drops out now there wo n't be a primary so we do n't need to worry about that and the only people it would risk pissing off are the diehard democratic voters who are going to vote d no matter what anyway
you ’re living in cuckoo land you can make all of the historical comparisons you like but considering that most of the people who will decide this election are only starting to tune in now and their first impression of this campaign will be seeing one of the candidates seemingly forgetting what he was talking about mid sentence on numerous occasions i do n’t see how you can spin this as anything other than disastrous you ’re pointing out the risks involved with swapping out candidates without acknowledging the near certainty that the current candidate ca n’t possibly win
your recent examples are irrelevant the candidates did n't step aside we ca n't learn anything more than that than we can from 1992 when an unpopular sitting president was defeated despite the advantages of incumbency
eh i do not think so lol anyone who was n’t motivated to vote before did n’t get a kick in the pants this cycle and they surely were n’t waiting for this debate to get their first intro to either of these dudes
the thing is that biden has been president for four years this is n't anyone 's first interaction with biden who is over the age of 21
' never mind all that reality i know what everyone else is thinking and yer cuckoo ' thanks for the quality comment
republicans had primaries with some competition in 1992 just like democrats had in 1980 both times the incumbent lost the general election from that we can learn that incumbents with serious challenges lose elections thank you for providing another example against your notion
none of those historical analogies matter because a presidential candidate has never had his brain break repeatedly in the middle of a fucking debate being watched by 50 million people and if you think that wo n’t have an impact then you are absolutely cuckoo
what happened yesterday is a massive disaster on a historic scale switching candidates is very risky but keeping biden is also very risky also predictions are not a better measurement then polling averages
incumbents with serious challenges you mean like with biden and his challenge stringing a sentence together and historically dismal approval rating i 'm not sure how that supports your point or negates mine
where was this fervor from the new york times when the republicans decided to support a convicted felon rapist
since 90 % of people commenting in this thread clearly have n’t read the nyt editorial board article here it is without the paywall
hubris is what doomed 2016 seems like we are getting a second dose y all
i really hope this is n't bader ginsburg all over again
a snub from nyt editorial board meant something 30 years ago not anymore
the ny times is not ok with biden having a bad night but are ok with a liar a conman and a convict to run for president
sleepwalking into another trump presidency and this time it will be filled with retribution in his own words hope these dems are ready for that
the biden campaign and the democratic party are sticking their heads into the sand
who exactly do all these people think would be willing to step in besides harris in july with no money
any one can have a bad night anyone can be in a situation where the people running the show are n't following the rules cnn were n't you going to fact check is biden old sure is trump a liar old and a convicted felon yes why is n't the nyt editorial calling for trump to drop out of the race for the good of the country
biden is just as delusional and in denial as people in this sub
the campaign can brush it off all the want and the party will lose because they 're being guided by their own hubris biden is unfit for the job
i really do n’t get an ego maniac vibe from biden so i do n’t know why he ’s so insistent that he must stay put he ’s 81 years old go home and hang out with your family while you still have time he 's had an incredibly long and successful career my feeling is that if he does n't step down in the next few days he wo n't be stepping down at all
the media is complicit in trump ’s crimes
ithe paper ’s editorial board biden in the general election in 2020 but sens amy klobuchar d minn and elizabeth warren d mass during the democratic primaries earlier that year given the choice i would vote for either one of them over biden
arrogant and detached from reality
trump has been absolutely incoherent for 5 yrs i do n't recall the nyt editorial board writing about it and telling him to drop out of the race
as i 've said since the start of the campaign he should not have run for reelection this was an obvious issue which was never going to get better it 's a shame no alternative was ever set up or at least foreseen i ca n't help but think of the audio for the hur report which biden has prevented from being released it seems even more obvious now he must sound very bad in it i also think of how biden 's done very few interviews with the media and has had the smallest interaction with the press since reagan it 's clear he tries hard to not speak off the cuff because he knows exactly what 's going on and does his best to hide it i 'm actually surprised he called for this debate at all but maybe he knew he could n't avoid one completely and wanted to get it over with early
we need to have this conversation now we have a whole month to figure it out before the convention biden is unfit to serve i know trump is unfit for different reasons but that ’s no excuse to force somebody incapable for the role into the most demanding office in the world it ’s clear that he has n’t been governing and the cabinet has been while it is true the president mainly delegates it ’s also true that the most crucial decisions are delegated to the president
i killed my subscription to the nyt over their normalization of trumpism and their fairness approach to political coverage this is reactionary even for them i kept my games subscription though
it would mean more coming from almost any other paper even the wsj 's editorial board has been more sympathetic to biden than the nyt 's has
no enemy of nato trump is a friend of mine
new york times is dangerous because it has been around forever and has established itself as a pillar of journalism so when it does stupid shit it carries weight and does damage right wing media replays the ny times stupid shit on a loop to give credibility to its own complete bullshit in recent years for what they put forth as an attempt at fair and balanced coverage the nyt has been soft on the right and the danger they pose to society they give voice to maniacs like trump and marjorie taylor greene when they should be calling them out a more subtle thing they do is to phrase a headline in an ambiguous way that is technically true but could be misleading without the context of the article for example the other day there was a headline that said “ supreme court says prosecutors overstepped with jan 6 charge ” this was about using obstruction of justice charge against some people involved in jan 6 and maybe it was not a good fit for this crime fine but taken out of context and headlines often are it could easily been misinterpreted as prosecutors are being too harsh on the insurrectionists and that jan 6 maybe was n’t as big a deal as we are making it out to be and if that feels like a stretch at the very least it is taking the sting out of how serious the insurrection was when democracy is on the line you need to choose a side and the nyt like trump sees nazis on one side and says there ’s good people on both sides
trump was louder so that makes him the winner democrats love to punish their own ask al franken if trump had stumbled like biden the donations would have tripled and fawkes news would have massaged the tape to make him sound like winston churchill
“ if the race comes down to a choice between mr trump and mr biden the sitting president would be this board ’s unequivocal pick that is how much of a danger mr trump poses “ it is a snub and it is their position that there must be someone better
the ny times would love nothing more than to see trump elected
lots of trumpers here to heap abuse on biden and spread a bunch of bs hand wringing seems to be common across the political subs today
ny times chief editor still butt hurt biden has n’t given them a one on one and the editor said to go hard on biden for that journalistic integrity at its finest
i cancelled my subscription as soon as i read it shame on them
snub that was the truth
he had a bad debate time for him to go there is not a chance biden will drop out who was this written for
the north carolina speech kinda proves them wrong again
the ny times article is dumb because anyone with any type of historical political sense knows replacing a presidential candidate six months out from election day is a losing strategy every presidential campaign has to recover from stumbles but the left and the media act like biden must step down when he stumbles trump was never held to this standard when he was president or now people assume he can do anything and not lose support even after people from his own wh have turned on him the media assumes trump wo n't be harmed politically even though he lost the last election and his non incumbent endorsements mean very little
the biden campaign is either a bunch of liars or ignorant as hell either way they are fucking up big time
shows you just how clueless they are yeah biden has to go but we ’re ok with trump and his lies another subscription i ’ll be say bye to
i will never support that pos rag ever again no money no nothin i do n't care what kind of article they have they 're not fit to be toilet paper for wombats
i ’m not rushing to judgement one bad debate performance is not gon na make me not vote vote for trump or rfk if biden continues to stumble or has bad appearances repeatedly then i will start to worry but not after one debate performance
nyt created the current ufo craze with a completely fabricated article it 's total trash
the nyt spoke to all the top democrat megadonors before writing that piece their position is based on that of those donors biden is toast the big money suppliers know he ca n’t win after that performance the polls over the next weeks will confirm that anyone who thinks biden still has a meaning chance of victory needs to leave their democrat bubble for a moment and take a look at the horrendous fallout from the debate
reminder if bernie had never run for president on a ridiculous platform of pandering free shit trump would have never been president thanks bernie
no one expects anything from republicans so they get a pass
earlier this year ben shapiro said something like would i grade my child the same way i grade an adult when asked about why he gives trump a pass for so many things he looked at the person he was debating as if they were crazy when they responded why not grade him like a president i think it 's a lot more people than ben shapiro that grade trump on a curve as if he were a child even if they oppose him i do n't get why we all accept that 's okay for a presidential candidate
did you read the editorial the whole point is that trump has to be defeated it 's too big a risk to gamble on biden
“ ny times denounces trump for billionth time ” who cares
these guys been shilling for trump for a while now their coverage of biden turned sour and they ’ve published a bunch of pro trump articles recently their slant seems perfectly clear remember when journalists were expected to be impartial and just report the facts so the public could make properly informed decisions
tom friedman is a shill “ i cried ” when watching the debate reference to biden what a spineless jellyfish
the new york times editorial board consists of people trump dreams he could be like they are ivy league educated neoliberal insiders and the creme de la creme of the new york elite suffice to say they could care less about either trump or the gop publishing their thoughts on biden 's predicament does more to help the democratic party in the general election than chastising the gop for let me check being the gop
end of the day it ’s simply wreckless to publish this 18hrs after the event we need to see the impacts on polling trump did not walk gaining people and we generally underestimate how much people respond to honesty in the face of rapid lies
bob woodward was just on cnn all but saying that biden is dealing with a diagnosis he kept saying i ca n't speculate but i would want to know exactly what happened last night what was going on medically what was going on psychiatrically we need to know the exact details of how this happened in order that we can move forward it 's very unusual to walk so close to the line but not cross it i think that shows that there 's resistance from the biden camp but dang i wonder how many days it can hold
it is and this subreddit is in full denial
far worse because the next potus will pick 2 3 justices also this whole fucking thing is hubris hubris from biden running again after the implicit message that he was a transitional leader for a new generation hubris from biden 's closest advisors supporting this decision and to debate in his condition hubris from this entire white house that this was n't an unmitigated fucking disaster and he wants to debate fucking again fucking hell these people should not be running the country scotus is going to be conservative now forever we 're fucking an entire generation
ginsburg could have been replaced the issue is the incumbent advantage is huge and there 's not a replacement that 's polling better right now beyond that and i could be wrong but i ca n't recall a presidential debate ever having a significant impact on an election the performance was terrible but i just do n't see a better option right now with ginsburg there was no real downside to replacing her
except if we elect joe biden and he dies we just get kamala and then she replaces some scotus assholes probably so it ’s exactly the opposite
ruth bader biden bill maher called that weeks ago
i think we 're all lying to ourselves that it 's not her legacy is allowing a republican majority because she was too arrogant to step down in her freaking 80s and biden 's legacy will be the death of american democracy two people who 's addiction to power was stronger than their love for their country disgraceful
well she did n’t have the launch codes so
it is to achieve such lofty positions of power to step away is to end your life
it is everyone is too stupid to admit it we will look back in 10 years asking what happened when this is the reality right now
losing confidence in biden 's ability to beat trump is not an endorsement for trump jfc
they made this piece precisely because they 're not ok with the convict winning biden not being able to destroy whatever trump said last night shows that he is not up to the task of winning this election he asked for that debate that was supposed to be the thing that turned the tide in his favor it was a test and he failed
no it spells out in the article exactly why it ’s so important because of how terrible he is
keep bury your head in the sand if you want to win dems needs a better candidate
what a pathetic talking point this is
they ’re only reporting on biden because trump is much of the same and biden ’s performance last night was abominable
no such thing as bad publicity trump ’s felonies are old news and deplorables do n’t read anyways
a bad night jesus christ you are all deluded
guess you did n’t read it
unfortunately half the country are ok with trump being a liar a conman and a convict
have n't they been pretty anti biden since he did n't give them an interview they 've had a huge bias against him for a while now
some of us want biden or any democratic candidate to win we 're not sleepwalking because we 're working to ensure trump does n't win if you 're sleepwalking into a trump presidency that 's on you just do n't blame others for the loss if you did't try to organize the people you know that trump should n't be president
and so is much of this sub
until an alternative candidate is announced it 's too dangerous to spend so much time tearing biden down rather than trump this is why you see people like bernie sanders and gavin newsom rallying to put people 's heads on straight and keep them focused
if there 's one thing that will fix an aging problem it 's time
unless it 's harris it makes zero sense and even still you turn a dicey situation into possibly an unwinnable one kamala is still 6 6 % away from trump in her poll avg and the media darlings further back than her proposed biden is the only one objectively keeping trump at least dead locked in polls on avg right now or mildly trailing or ahead at best
perhaps they are hoping for someone like eugene mccarthy or ted kennedy considering how those elections went
people forget about 1980 dems thought carter should step aside because he looked too weak carter refused he was the incumbent he guided the country through a major economic crisis and his policies were slowly bringing about improvement dems decided to rebel and field a more progressive candidate to primary carter a nasty campaign followed the american public got the message “ if carter ’s own party does n’t support him why should we ” ronald reagan won that election in a landslide
they are lol they ripped him throughout the article and said he 's an existential threat to the country
not a debate when one fool is spewing non stop lies
the nyt calling for trump to drop out does n’t have influence over trump his voters it does over biden his voters really this argument is bizarre trump is not someone who is going to do something for the good of the country biden is potentially and please he ’s old but that was something we knew before the debate he was nearly incoherent in the debate and trump jumped on that opportunity we can say biden is a president who has done good things and also say he is not equipped to handle this important general election we need to wake tf up if we do n’t want a trump presidency
shit is crazy “ biden has a bad night he should drop out ” literaly what the fuck how about running headlines like “ how can a convicted felon liable rapist be the republican nominee ”
everyone can have a bad night biden had the worst night ever in a presidential debate between the major parties he ’s cooked he needs to leave the race and tap someone else for the nomination
biden is likely unfit for the job of winning the election i think biden has proven himself to be a very capable president because he ’s surrounded himself with an excellent staff and trusts their judgment the problem is it ’s difficult to convince undecided voters of this when he appears so outwardly senile
beating trump should be the easiest job in the world i have serious doubts that biden can do it worse i worry it could be a landslide for republicans
look at this comment section though the delusion is everywhere people are to afraid to take drastic measures and it is going to cost us dearly
he 's not an outright egomaniac but there is a tendency with boomers in power to hold onto it past their time we 've seen it with rbg and feinstein and it even crosses party lines with mcconnell instead of developing the bench of next generation leaders to lead the party into the future they 're clinging to power well past retirement age because they do n't trust anyone but themselves
maybe because he realizes he ’s fine and so does everyone close to him despite the armchair doctor diagnoses
the biden campaign or nyt editorial board
who the liberal media or biden campaign
this is such a stupid argument the nyt has bashed the hell out of trump for years obviously they do n’t think he should be the nominee they ’re just not stupid enough to think they could convince him to drop out they could influence such a decision for biden tho
why would the nyt do that it ’s a left leaning publication so its audience is not the rnc it ’s the same when you see left leaning pundits saying “ biden has to do this and that to wine the election ” you do n’t see the same people saying “ trump then has to do this and that to win ” why would they and it ’s not as if they ’re pro trump they painted trump as the bogeyman when asking for biden to step down putin sucks but you do n’t see american publications asking him to step down right instead they characterise him as someone that needs to be defeated they ’re doing the same here no
you either read nothing from them or have the memory of a goldfish
has had the smallest interaction with the press since reagan i was too young to care about politics under reagan so i 'm wondering why he would have been press shy he was an actor before politics they typically love the spotlight
you can have reddit conversations all you want but biden is your candidate and you can either vote for him trump or no one which helps trump
same i need those crosswords
70million more people will see the debate then todays biden and it will be run to death till the election its over he has to step aside
stop trump with a weak hand
republicans know that the only way they can get donald trump back into power is by discouraging voters and other voter suppression tricks that 's why such discouragement is spammed everywhere
where are they ok with trumps lies they 've been critical of him for years saying he 's unfit for office running stories about how the election is about preserving democracy they 've pointed out his lies before fact checked him too they 've outlined prj 2025 and how trump will wield executive power in a terrifying way literally ran an oped this week about it they 're being realistic that his performance lost votes and that he 's trailing trump in polls in an election that matters too much the opportunity to find another candidate was best before the primaries but now will work too to have an open convention
should n't a president or candidate be held to a much higher standard
no no no do n’t read the article just complain that they ’re being mean to my best buddy dark brandon lol is n’t that meme so fun trump is bad and only biden can beat him the dem copium that has been thrown around here recently has been so crazy i ’m starting to wonder if he actually won that debate we watched him crash and burn trump needs to lose running a senile and demented old man who ca n’t speak in complete sentences does n’t allow for the highest possible chance to beat him it ’s not a bad thing to say this if it ’s true and god damn it ’s very true
new york times and maggie haberman are big part of trumps success she helped normalize him in her reporting during her time as an insider on his 2016 campaign and later it was revealed she held back what she should have been reporting on for her eventual book
for real there 's literally thousands of anti trump editorial articles from the ny times over the last 7 years ops criticism is lame
this is the stupidest take i ’ve seen yet
or maybe the ny times in these times of peak capitalism have placed their thumb on the scale for the candidate who makes them the most money
no such thing as bad publicity
nyt is trying to tell us what we think to influence the polling nyt wants donald trump in badly
“ we need to wait until the carriages have completely burned before we decide if this train wreck was bad ”
end of the day it ’s simply wreckless to publish this 18hrs after the event i mean they can do whatever they want it 's their own newspaper we do n't have to care about what they say
how is it reckless take trump out of the equation put politics aside should biden be in charge of getting us through the next four years you either did n’t watch the debate or you ’re crazy if you think that let ’s not be like maga let ’s not form a cult around one personality the democrat party should be about ideas god dammit not backing every establishment politician the oligarchy tees up for us with blind loyalty
no it is n’t to do anything less is to ask people to deny watt they all just saw
i have voted democrat my entire life appreciate everything the biden administration has accomplished these last four years and am 100 % certain after watching that debate that joe biden should not be the president of the united states for four more years he does not have the mental faculties for it even if he had a cold if a simple cold can damage your mental faculties to that degree you are no longer fit for such an incredibly important role pretty obviously donald trump should not be president either which means for the good of the country biden needs to step aside any other decision is destructive selfish pride a la rbg or complete and utter delusion
ok if that 's true then biden is being reckless with the future of the country ffs there 's no shame in being retired in your 80s
i have friends that have connections to influential democratic donors and they are saying that biden was asked to consider stepping down a couple of months ago but it was jill biden who insisted the joe should continue on jill biden is very much in love with being the first lady and is not willing to give it up you can even see it in the rallies how much she loves all the adoration this vanity will be the undoing of this country the same goes for biden ’s cabinet they knew that joe biden has suffered severe mental regression and they covered it up because they knew if a new nominee came forward that it would be a new cabinet and they would be out of a job selfishness and vanity before the country will pave the way for a trump victory
i ’m seeing this across reddit in so many comments in post after post it ’s so egregious that it ’s making me wonder if this is being engineered orchestrated because this is not a normal response to what we all just saw last night it ’s advanced gaslighting every major publication that was pro biden has come out clearly and strongly saying he needs to step down nytimes the atlantic the economist etc in column after column they are not saying this lightly neither is woodward everyone is alarmed that biden has clearly taken a very visible steep decline that he wo n’t be recovering from and that is not who should be currently running the country it ’s also not who should be running against an existential threat and attempting to make it thru another four years what we saw last night is just the beginning and it will get worse the only people interested in perpetuating this nightmare and have probably been shielding the public from how bad it ’s gotten are the people who benefit from it namely the people holding current jobs in this administration and if like feinstein they are egging this poor man on and telling him he ’s fine then we are in deep trouble because he clearly can not see his own impairment enough to step down
and yet they do n't call for a deranged lunatic to drop out
thank you for actually reading the article and being able to understand it
so many people have just retreated to “ but trump is worse ” and i agree but that ’s not how you win elections we need someone inspiring forcing a “ lesser of 2 evils ” choice is how we ended up with trump winning in 2016
sad but trrrruuueee dunnn dun dun dduunnaaaahhh
they could have put kamala up there derp
pleas by all means enlighten us
it was n't abominable if you rewatch it biden was quiet and hoarse a bit off his debate game and not the one favored by the fascist billionaire who owns and dictates cnn but he did not stand there and spew lie after lie after lie and he did n't shit his pants which trump did audibly
trump played a little better than his handicap he only audibly shit his pants once biden played worse he was hoarse and lethargic but biden was still the only one answering the questions i ’m tired of people pretending that the expectations game is all that matters
i think they mean that keeping biden on the ticket is sleepwalking into a trump presidency
it ’s so nuts people on here hate donald trump so much but refuse to support changing something that could actually mean we defeat him all to defend joe biden
i hope they ’re talking behind the scenes they were n’t going to break today but they ’re almost certainly talking with each other privately
exactly i do n't care if biden steps down i just want to make sure if he does there 's at least 1 or 2 very viable candidates that will step up that 's going to take some time several weeks at least before even possible realistic rumors begin to emerge and none of us may even know until the convention in august but until then biden is still the candidate and it 's best for all dems and left leaning potential voters to concentrate on tearing down trump rather than tearing down biden
look at newsom 's actions he has been warming up in the bullpen for the past year or so he knows that as ridiculous as it would be to run to most progressive governor he 'd be as consensus of a pick among democrats as a nominee could get
there ’s only been 1 poll of harris v trump this year february and harris was down 3 % with 11 % undecided
biden is 25 years older than jimmy carter was in 1980
this right here is a really good argument as to why biden should step aside
which is why biden should simply withdraw and avoid a nasty fight to remove him
but they wo n't call for him to drop out because they would fucking love nothing more than for their reality show clickbait sugar daddy to win
why not both biden looked awful and that performance of his could be his electoral doom
his speech today was full of energy and coherent plenty of those moments ahead too it ’s all about gotv everyone is decided on these known entities they just may not be decided to vote in many instances to vote against someone
his administration maybe but after last night he ’s obviously not the one running the country which is frightening
winning the election means his whole administration stays on losing the election means they 're kicked out so comments i 've seen talking about how his manifest senility for 90 minutes in the highest profile public moment of the campaign is no big deal because biden picked good advisors are missing the point it 's true that the picks for the administration are more relevant to running the country than the president himself true for every president it 's also true that the president himself is the face of the campaign and biden is likely to lose especially after last night skills at governance and skills at politics are not identical and biden is incapable of fulfilling one of the basic skills of a competent politician which is speaking in public off the cuff trump is n't good at it either but it 's a bigger political liability for biden than trump unfair but also true
we do n't know that and after last night 's performance i wonder how is trump doing on those calls to bibi i wonder why biden ca n't get an aid truck in he 's being run over by the guy on the other line blinkin only has so much pull
honestly the white house is n't even the biggest issue the senate will most likely be lost even a strong top of the ticket this round is red for the senate the house can be taken back but those candidates need a strong presidential candidate to inspire voters to come out and vote full ticket biden is n't going to be able to mount his own aggressive campaign he wo n't be able to help house candidates at all they 'll lose the house sotomayor is n't doing great she 's probably going to have to resign in the next 4 years on a health issue she may not have a choice alito and thomas are pretty healthy but they 'll resign for trump so trump will nominate a couple con law recent grads who will sit on the court for a few decades gorsuch coach kav and amy are all in their 50s they can sit for another 20 25 years roberts may even throw in the towel trump will have appointed 7 supreme courst justices under 60 in his 2 terms kagan is 65 it 'll be a 7 2 court for 20 years
it should be easy on paper but it 's absolutely not this is not the pre 2016 world and his reach has grown substantially since then in all facets there 's a big audience for what trump is selling period and that is fascism
trump is also unfit for the job it is n't zero sum this is n't a case of put 2 people up there and one is unfit so by default the other is fit you can put me and my cousin mikey up there and i love mikey but we 're both unfit
agreed but these people you ’re talking about are even older than boomers they ’re silent gen as a californian feinstein in particular made me insane a dinosaur holding on to an important senate seat when someone far more progressive than her could easily nab it as a woman rbg well way to undo your life ’s work lady
you realize do n't you that joe biden is not a baby boomer as he was born during world war 2
enough with blaming boomers for everything these people are not boomers they are silent generation
in his speech today he admitted that he ’s not as light on his feet as he once was i do nt think he ’s incoherent or suffering from dementia but watch clips from the 2008 or 2012 cycles we need that guy not the one we ’ve got now
both tbh biden should have stuck to the original statement that he would be a 1 term president the nyt should be honest and admit that yeah biden ’s performance at the debate was terrible and normally would be disqualifying but a plank of wood would make a better president than trump and a decrepit biden ’s a better potential president than a plank of wood
that ’s literally this subreddit heads buried in the sand making facile arguments because they ca n’t come to grips with just how bad the optics and mental power are for biden this is n’t an argument of whether trump should fuck off he should and everyone left of center right knows it it ’s an argument of why biden needs to step aside because he will not beat trump in this state he is in
he was developing alzheimer ’s and was ostensibly kept from the press ’ by his council of elrond to protect him
obviously if we get to november and those are the choices biden is my vote but the conversation about him stepping aside should happen now while there 's time before the convention then the delegates would choose someone new and we 'd have to rally around them to beat trump after the debate it 's clear that biden will likely lose if trump is an existential threat to democracy should n't we do anything else that may win
he wo n’t he does n’t have to at all you might wish he did but he made his decision and the primaries already happened so you can either vote for him vote for trump or stay home and help trump anyway
trump ’s about to get sentenced for his felony this news will blow away especially in four months both these guys have four years of presidential history we know what we ’re getting one night and a dozen word stumbles wo n’t change that if he gets too old or dies in office then his vp will step up i trust the team he has built and succeeded for four years sometimes presidents die in office it ’s not that rare one thing for sure though is trump is a nightmare
they used to be trump ’s special he brought elementary school tactics to the presidential level and has been successful who knew that being a bully acting like a 2 year old and childish name calling would work at the presidential level trump has forever lowered the bar of american politics and people like mtg and hand job bobert have been the beneficiaries i think it says more about a very significant number of american citizens than it does about trump if they were more mature and sophisticated trump ’s bullshit would n't fly
definitely but right now only one presidential candidate is being graded like a president and i just ca n't respect the opinions of the journalists like those at the nyt who keep acting like that 's okay
you know when the right things you 're a fucking dogshit trash liberal rag and the left thinks you 're a fucking dogshit trash conservative rag you 're doing something right
i read the nyt i consider it opo research mainly having said that the 50ish percent of the country that will vote for or consider voting for trump do not read the nyt this was an internal memo
nyt is trying to tell us what we think to influence the polling the nyt 's audience for that article is not the general populace they are speaking directly to the democratic party nyt wants donald trump in badly i find this claim difficult to believe the nyt is the voice of moderate neoliberalism it 's doubtful they are even capable of desiring trump as potus due to causality
if nyt wanted trump in they would n't be pushing for biden to leave his odds at beating trump are looking extremely grim
so nyt is pissed biden has n’t given them an interview lol he should probably just do an interview with them and get it over but that is so petty
does n’t make it less irresponsible this is n’t something that should be done in haste from a paper that claims they want to preserve democracy
what a pointless comment lmao
it 's insane to me that if trump gets elected we 're gon na lay the blame at a newspaper instead of the people who went to the polls and chose to vote for him
the establishment politician has produced more popular legislation than any president in 30 years it ’s irresponsible because we have had zero opportunity to measure the impacts of what transpired or assess the risks of such a gamble
ok if that 's true then ah yes the big if true approach
so trump should retire as he 's about 80 and is obviously suffering from dementia they can send him to a federal hospital prison to serve out his multiple sentences
do n't take some pundit 's uneducated speculation as truth even if it 's true it 's just woodward wondering out loud on tv because he 's being paid to be there there was no evidence of biden dealing with a diagnosis the day before the debate the evening after the debate during his post debate speech or today during his rally in nc do n't look at a single moment in time as definitive of the entirety of biden take it into account for sure but it 's not the be all to end all especially when it comes from pundits opining especially ones who like attention and excel at long term investigative research not medical diagnosis through a tv set
do n’t be mad at biden be mad at the media and the party that ’s lied to you for the past year then decided to do a complete 180 for some odd reason his performance was no surprise to anyone paying attention and actually was not all that bad the medias reaction was the biggest shock of the night
he ’s putting himself ahead of the country
86 and wanting to go till literally 90 edit i was mistaken trump is 78 and biden is 81 ty
cite your sources or you 're just full of shit
they know trump would never drop out and republicans would never ask for that they ’re trying to appeal in their opinion to reason this is an editorial opinion this is the type of thing they were designed for
that would be a wasted effort and certainly not news
because trump would literally wipe his ass with the page and laugh
they ’re calling for him to drop out because they feel he ’s gon na get blown out which he will
what do you mean “ we ” notmypresident
the nyt has constantly said trump should not be in power and in this fucking article which you obviously did n’t read they reiterated that biden needs to drop out because of how dangerous trump is
biden could n’t form a coherent sentence when talking about some of the biggest softball questions he kinda did audibly shit his pants
his only job was to show america that he was n’t too old and feeble to do the job he did the opposite people are forgetting how important optics are for politicians as much as i want him to be the savior against trump he looked horrible and will undoubtedly destroy democrats ’ chance remaining in power
it was objectively abominable people keep being like “ well biden has a rough night but trump lied the whole time ” from a perception standpoint everyone expected trump to do exactly what he did trump may not have changed many minds but he did n’t push away anyone who was already gon na vote for him biden on the other hand probably changed some minds in a bad way the man did not look coherent i do n’t know why w have to pretend otherwise
most people are politically disengaged they vote way more simply and way more misinformed than you and i would likely vote biden ’s debate hiccup is all they ’re thinking about now
biden had a “ cold ” apparently one of those 24 hour bugs
just total denial people chocking that up to a stutter some gaffes a cold with a hoarse voice etc are denying reality
but the democratic party should already have had two or three viable candidates ready on the bench
i ’m sorry biden having an off night is electoral doom but trump being convicted of 34 counts of fraud and being found liable for rape are not
because he had the security of a teleprompter
if joe biden is already not the one running the country he must have put some good people in there because america is running better than it has in decades i say keep them
are you basing this on just last night or are you considering the several long form interviews he 's done such as with howard stern conan o'brien and seth meyers his sotu speech his speech last night post debate his speech today in nc etc if you 're basing your opinion on just last night then i see why you 're confused if you 're actually basing it on the past 6 months of public interviews and speeches then show us what evidence you have he 's not running the country
i wonder why biden ca n't get an aid truck in this is pure disinformation biden is the only reason there is any aid going in gaza or even palestine at all some trucks were stopped yes maybe you do n't understand it but aid is often delayed in active military zones but if it were n't for biden the port would n't have been built egypt would n't have stopped blocking aid israeli strikes would still be happening along aid corridors and hamas would be attacking and stealing far more aid than without biden 's ability to see it through if you 're going to post something so blatantly false at least make it not so easily disproved
100 % agreed to make matters worse this is n't a one bad night issue biden is deeply unpopular and had no plan for many of the current problems facing americans that coupled with his condition and the fact we 've been lied to about his capacity by his team is a complete shit storm
looks like the senate is already lost because joe manchin is leaving no other democrat can possibly be elected in west virginia so the democrats are starting off at a 1
anyone voting for biden now will vote for any other d candidate the issue is that anyone who is on the fence is now very much put off by biden
you 're also voting for a party if you sit it out while fascists rise to power that 's on you
fuck that i ’m voting for mikey
i ’ll take the four year proven presidential vet tbh armchair diagnoses be damned
the nyt should be honest and admit that yeah biden ’s performance at the debate was terrible and normally would be disqualifying but a plank of wood would make a better president than trump and a decrepit biden ’s a better potential president than a plank of wood that ’s more or less what they said you did n’t read the opinion piece
i do n't want a plank of wood for president i want someone who has some semblance of a plan neither of these candidates are fit to run
biden should have stuck to the original statement that he would be a 1 term president i actually looked recently and i could n't find him actually saying this he said he saw himself as a bridge which i guess implied it but i think people really read into it aggressively
yeah clearly the convicted rapist and felon is a better president since there ’s a trumper who does n’t believe epstine ’s buddy daughter toucher was convicted
he was developing alzheimer ’s and his administration was constantly embroiled in scandals and corruption lots of questions he did n't want to address
he does n't have to but it would be both the strategic and moral choice for to step aside and for the democratic candidate to be selected in an open convention like the good ol bad ol days because democrats are correct about the existential risk of trump 's re election and biden is not as likely to defeat trump as another candidate would be it is more likely than not especially after last night that trump will be re elected if his opponent in the general election is biden why should biden step aside because the risk of losing in november associated with switching to another candidate now is obviously lesser than the risk of biden continuing as the democratic general election candidate the first presidential debate is typically the highest profile public appearance for either candidate during any election season biden spent virtually the entire 90 minutes proving that he is apparently senile trump just showed up as the same trump we know a confident liar being a confident liar is morally worse than being an incoherent truth teller but being a confident liar is politically much more advantageous than being an incoherent truth teller i will vote for biden if i must but a continued biden candidacy is the riskiest path forward and in all likelihood means a trump victory because he proved in the highest profile public appearance of the election that trump 's smears about biden 's senility are n't false trump too is senile and incoherent and additionally a liar but that is not as much of a political liability for trump as it is for biden is that unfair yes is that true also yes you should work on accepting the truth of things that you do n't want to be true especially when longtime boosters of biden major non fox media players who previously downplayed biden 's age and senility and the vast majority of people who watched it found biden 's debate performance so bad that it is virtually disqualifying ironically it 's on reddit of all places that you see more of this kind of blindfolded fingers in ears moral grandstanding that fails to acknowledge politics has a strategic dimension at least outside of the sycophants in biden 's circle and ladder climbing democratic careerists
or you 're consciously playing both sides against one another in order to encourage civil unrest
that 's not at all how that works
devils advocate trump was great for revenue and clicks i ’m sure engagement and headship was up during the covfefe era
no matter what the media says they want trump in office for 4 years you had to see hear what he did or said on a daily basis even well before covid he ’d threaten north korea with nuclear war at 2 am or spout some nonsense covefe and it drew eyeballs clicks even the sheer outrage of having him in office would get people to pay attention they do n’t like having a boring president like biden because he ’s not an over the top caricature
that ’s exactly what they would do you think because it helps the dems
he raised 15 million overnight
if nyt wanted trump in they would n't be pushing for biden to leave historically replacing an incumbent has n't gone well not saying it will be the same with biden but it 's not a choice the campaign wants to make lightly so if they do have an anti biden bias it kind of makes sense for them to get behind the call to replace biden
ridiculous taking out the primary winner now would be worse than what happened in 1968 and 1980 we actually have history on this kind of thing also as of now joe biden has slightly better than a 50 50 chance by the pollsters and the polls have leaned heavily republican in recent years
his odds are now 350 interestingly the odds for any ’ democratic candidate are 120
probably that would be the best thing to do given the bad choices but expect nyt to twist it all up and make joe biden look as bad as possible should he do so but maybe not as nyt loves to go after democrats like they did with hillary clinton and the emails tough call
unfortunately it was more than just the nyt saying biden should step down today that kind of dilutes your point
it was irresponsible for biden and his team to run him again in the first place they ’re with him everyday they know how old he is
trump voters are uneducated and motivated by anger they do not care what he does on the debate stage a “ mainstream ” media newspaper telling him to step aside for the 50th time would only motivate the base with more anger it ’s been done biden needs educated intelligent voters to feel motivated to go out and vote for him democrats are not motivated by rage you ’re wanting both parties to be on equal footing and we are way past that republicans feel no shame
why do you seem so willing to go down with the ship we 're trying to beat trump we 're not trying to elect biden
his performance was actually not all that bad hoo boy this is the hardest spin and cope i ’ve heard since thursday it was that bad it was historically bad i say this as a lifelong democrat who has watched every most debates over the last two decades and i ’m including rick perry ’s “ oops ” moment and even gary johnson ’s “ what is aleppo ” moment denying that it was a terrible debate does n’t do anyone any good and not even the biden campaign is trying to argue that it was n’t bad
i 'll fault them but i 'm gon na fault biden too man saw the perilous road ahead and kept on it
i am not gon na out my friends are you crazy for what for internet points do n't believe it if you do n't to it does n't matter to me i am simply stating facts within the inner circles that i know i am not forcing anyone to believe them if you do n't want to i am simply stating the truth as conveyed to me you think down votes hurt me you 're just hurting yourselves the longer you stay in denial biden 's campaign is finished and believe me nobody is more hurt about it than me
which is exactly what biden should do f the new york times
nah he 's gon na win what did trump do to win over moderate independent voters in that debate he was acting like a lunatic
yeah it ’s like he ’s near death
that was trump and because it was only his mike that was live at the time there 's no denying it was trump trump is the one who has worn adult diapers for years trump is the one who walks around smelling like shit sorry you 're unable to accept what people who actually know him and have described as his fecal incontinence for years and they were n't softball questions because biden was trying to actually answer the question while simultaneously countering all of trump 's land of a thousand lies all at the same time run along back to your twitch
true and then not true
i ’d argue all trump ’s issues are baked in trump has a way of spreading shit around to reduce negative press against him biden was meant to be the competent option he did not look the part the other night and the whole nation who watched saw it biden has a major visible problem and there ’s not really a realistic chance he will improve
he ad libbed quite a bit during today 's speech and last night 's was off the cuff president 's done govern in 1 2 minute sound bites unfortunately candidates do so the question everyone should be asking is who they want as president trump or biden and then voting and organizing to vote accordingly if biden steps down then so be it but until that happens it 's trump or biden and wishing it were otherwise is just living in a privileged fantasy world
i do n’t wanna vote for shadow governments i want to understand the person i vote for is making conscious decisions
i get all that but in what universe does someone who serves as president of the united states behaving a manner that joe biden did last night
i want the democratic party to win the presidency in november and that 's precisely the reason why biden should drop out because the risk of loss associated with his continued presumptive nomination for the general election is greater than the risk associated with an open convention will that be hard yes is that necessary to maximize the likelihood a democrat is elected president in november also yes do not sleepwalk blind yourself stick your fingers in your ears gaslight others about biden 's evident senility or pretend like it does n't matter because it is truly still the ethical thing to do to vote for him in november if it 's him vs trump stop thinking this is purely about superior ethics and policies get dirty and play the political game that 's how you win power rather than merely thinking yourself correct to vote for biden over trump as i will too if i must being morally correct with your vote matters very little if there 's no actual power that comes along with it to the people you voted for in politics it might make you feel a little better about losing but winning is the only thing that really matters in electoral politics did you learn nothing from 2016 morals are important but politics is about strategy and biden will likely lose especially after last night because he 's a piss poor evidently senile candidate he is not the best that the democrats have in store he is incapable of being a good politician at his age and his coterie is n't challenging him on it that 's true even if you think he has been a decent president and is superior to trump as a governing official by the way being good at governance and being a good politician are not identical but you must be a reasonably good politician in order to win maintain the power to govern at the highest levels and biden is quite obviously not a good politician anymore everyone knows he 's actually senile now it 's not just smears it 's not just rumors we saw and heard it with our own eyes and ears in the most viewed event of the entire campaign and no matter how hard you try to gaslight you will not disabuse people of that notion that is correctly shared among both democrats and republicans after last night your talking points about a cold and a stutter do not compare to the recorded widely viewed evidence and that 's even before comparing his performance last night to his prior ones only a few years ago we have decades of video footage of biden speaking publicly off the cuff at the level of a decently competent politician he is no longer a decently competent politician he is senile he will probably lose this election trump must be defeated biden must step aside for trump to be likelier than not to be defeated
they did say that but in the end they 're asking biden to step aside
they did n’t quite say that though they basically call on democrats to do soul searching because republicans wo n’t this being a nyt opinion piece is the editorial board placing pressure on biden but not at all calling out republicans and their voters in any meaningful way
biden has brought semiconductor production back to america started forgiving student loans increased access to healthcare expanded renewable energy how is that not a plan he just needs to keep doing what he is doing
after last night the chances of biden being replaced are a lot better than trump ’s so i ’ll take that
true but biden has a plan and has been pretty good at getting votes to get his plans through we are not a dictatorship and something happens to biden then kamal will step up i m voting to keep the country from falling to fascistic end of story
i guess that would explain why it seemed like he so quickly u turned on it if he never said it
what the fuck in my post made you think i ’m saying trump would make a better president lol i literally say a plank of wood would make a better president than the rapist president
show me trump ’s criminal conviction for rape
which side of that are you on
it was and more americans have n't been tuned into politics since but the nyt and the rest of the mainstream media can not stand trump even murdoch ca n't stand him
do you think roofers sit around praying for tornadoes all day
i ’m not american but even my news apps were exhausted every time i saw a notification it was oh fucking what now it was always this dipshit doing something else nefarious or straight up illegal to add to the mount made of his bullshit i ended up switching them off when covid hit because it was endless combined with local news we had our own clown show to deal with
who cares damage done he looked like a braindead zombie in front of 48 million people
his odds are now 350 interestingly the odds for any ’ democratic candidate are 120 what do those numbers even mean
not really the glenstone tribune does n't exactly have the same audience reach this could be the right move it 's not the right move less than a day after no one is claiming the performance was n't bad but the impacts could be far more nuanced than everyone is being led to believe
nah he ’s not he ’s given the trumpers truckloads of ammunition they are going to be insanely motivated his own base that frequently no shows the polls is going to have a corresponding decrease in enthusiasm trump almost certainly swayed some independents and the rest just wo n’t vote
i m just afraid that we ’re putting someone who ca n’t prosecute the case against trump the way it needs to be done
yeah it ’s called having a cold a speech impediment you sound like you ’ve given up on democracy over a single debate what did trump offer last night that was so great tell me about the policies he pitched
it really comes down to whether people feel their lives were better under one or the other while the polls are somewhat tight the underlying top issues are n’t so much economy and border
it 's your supposition that joe biden is n't making decisions that 's false but under your fantasy scenario things would still be very good even if your false claim were true we can pretend that there is some magical scenario where everyone coalesces behind some candidate but that is far less likely to happen than joe biden winning in 2024 we actually have history on it take a look at 1968 and 1980
those polls are so out of date and really does n't take into account any recent events
people sure are disappointed but everyone i know in a swing state is still voting for biden or trump and the debate did n’t change that if anything it makes dems less complacent cus they know they ca n’t take anything for granted and work their butts off to make sure they gotv
research allan lichtman and the 13 keys he says no way no how
so are msnbc cnn pod save america nate silver the list goes on genuinely the only news source i 've seen that has n't expressed this opinion has been the reddit front page where a newsweek article written about a tweet about a univision segment interviewing a room of a dozen people has over 10k upvotes at this point even the neoliberal sub is saying he should step aside what does that tell you
because biden demonstrated to the country that he can not campaign and can not beat trump people on this sub are in denial about just how bad it was
random redditor who did n't read a nyt editorial board article is now trying to outsmart the nyt editorial board man alive
do i need to give you quotes from the opinion piece they are writing about everything you say they do n’t
with an approval rating as abysmal as his he needed to articulate that plan and not fall into the trap of insulting his opponent he failed on all accounts last night and brought into question his competency over the next 4 years
at the end of the day they ’re a business their board will turn up their collective nose as ad spends go parabolic should they undermine the incumbent sufficiently and trump wins
big business roofing where management has never been on a roof certainly do you should see how excites they can get when a bad hail storm comes thru their area
basically a return on investment on a wager 1 on biden is a 3 50 profit if he is to win the implied probability is biden has a 22 2 % chance of winning with any democratic nominee at an implied probability of 45 %
yea the should have gotten anyone else
dismissing his performance as a cold and a speech impediment is hilarious cope you ’re setting yourself up for immense disappointment you can what about trump all you want but biden needed to illustrate a competent alternative and he failed the bar for success for biden was hilariously low and he dug himself a hole i previously thought implausible
i ’ve always liked joe biden and supported him but shame on him his family and the dnc for putting us inthis situation
not to mention ezra klein and the daily which to be fair is an nyt production
except nate silver who has zero political skill when polling is n't involved none of those other orgs have said biden should step down individual pundits have said it but not the entirety of the pundit class on any of those networks or their editorial boards if they have one and none of the psa guys said biden should step down they talked about it but none said he should if you 're going to exaggerate and spread disinformation at least make it believable
so are msnbc cnn pod save america nate silver the list goes on i did n't realize that msnbc took editorial stances could you please direct me to that i would like to read it or do you mean individual news readers and personalities
whatever else none of that translates to votes for trump in november
yet today he is raleigh nc acknowledging his poor showing and energetically giving trump hell
he already beat trump 4 years ago
i did read it but saying “ if the race comes down to a choice between mr trump and mr biden the sitting president would be this board 's unequivocal pick ” does n’t wipe away all the other sentences cutting into biden
they say this “ if the race comes down to a choice between mr trump and mr biden the sitting president would be this board 's unequivocal pick ” and they mention republicans wo n’t do soul searching because they ’re scum but they ’re placing the onus on biden and democrats to do better not the republicans i get it both should be doing better but this is america ’s most influential newspaper putting way more pressure on the side that is n’t putting up a wanna be fascist as a candidate
is it an insult if it is true per 538 biden 's approval rating is tracking trump 's presidential term so i 'm not concerned about it my perspective would be different if haley had been on stage
the board does n’t like trump either
yes exactly that is one of them but after the vague request for a source for who knows which point i checked that user 's comment page and realized that source was just a snide retort and decided not to reply but since i 'm here now i would like to provide another source this one for the point that polls have leaned heavily republican which should actually be common knowledge in this subreddit and no i did n't block that user i have never blocked anyone on reddit
this does n’t show conservative bias like the last commenter insinuated though at any rate they threw a temper tantrum and blocked me the second they were asked to back up their claims so that shows what kind of person they are
so like trump you did n’t answer my question and just went on about biden doing a bad job
' i 'm a big joe biden guy so i insist that he drop out and cause pandemonium in the party even though biden is tied in the polls ' btw joe biden won the primaries
but shame on him his family and the dnc for putting us inthis situation people had an opportunity to vote for someone else in the primaries people decided they wanted biden hell there were 21 people on the ballot in nh biden was n't even one of them and he still won the primary do n't put this on his family or your personal boogey man the dnc put it on the voters
lol ezra klein flip flops on biden stepping down every 3 weeks
whether it 's one anchor or the entire editorial board these people have nothing to gain from biden losing they are biden loyalists and also people have that have seen and been around a lot of elections if they 're saying he should step aside there 's probably a damn good reason i ca n't believe we 're even having this conversation
lol and nobody is going to see that biden 's team asked for this debate they set the terms they prepped for a week for this and he blew it so many people watched the first 10 minutes of that debate and cringed so hard they had to turn it off
everyone watches debates only biden fanboys will watch his rally in nc the guy blew it on the biggest stage he ca n't come back from that
only by using a teleprompter
yea 4 years ago when he could form a coherent thought in a debate
barely and he did n't have a disaster of a debate like this
the nyt thinks he 's unfit for president and is expressing so in the softest possible terms and you 're acting like they 're wrong for doing so as if you know more about the election process than the entire nyt editorial board dawg
not being honest about what we all see with our own eyes wo n’t help biden his base is now terrified that this is our best shot we need enthusiasm to galvanize voters not whatever this is yesterday was n’t just a wake up call it was a sledgehammer to the face hopefully the democrats finally realize this is serious
nyt got most major media to continue to beat the drum of ' joe biden drop out ' for another day why because nyt is against biden they can pretend they are the ' liberal media ' but they never have been and it may be worse than ever now
republicans are full of moral rot and lead poisoning and will not reconsider their support for trump due to an op ed in the new york times they think that the editorial board of nyt is a shapeshifting lizard person demonic pedophile cult that drinks adenochrome and controls the weather that is not the fringe of the gop that is the average republican voter although i will admit that knowing what a newspaper 's editorial board is probably granting their lead soup brains too much credit making a strategic political point to democrats while acknowledging that if biden does n't drop out it 's still the ethical choice to choose him over trump but he should drop out because he is unlikely to beat trump especially after last night and the risk of choosing someone new is lesser than the risk of biden failing to step aside that makes complete sense it 's not a double standard it 's realistic
the thing is i do n't care about insulting trump i wanted to hear solutions not mud slinging let trump sling mud biden should have been projecting confidence maturity and a plan that makes americans feel like he knows what he 's doing
i remember the democrats outperforming the midterms in 2022 remember how the media was saying it was going to be a “ red tsunami ” they barely took back the house and could n’t take the senate even though they were projected to
i ’m also a big fan of lots of people who are no longer capable of performing at the level they used to perform he ’s cooked convince yourself otherwise all you like
because of how well they stage managed him the administration convinced idiots like me that his cognitive decline was a bullshit republican talking point then last night happened democratic voters were carefully shielded from the reality and did n’t have the necessary information to inform their votes
klein is also pretty firmly attached to the democratic establishment he is no renegade berniebro who says dnc instead of national democratic party as someone far to the left of klein i do n't read listen to him to find opinions i will later adopt i read listen to klein to understand what an establishment democratic ideologue thinks because it is important to understand what people you disagree with think it just so happens that especially after last night klein and i agree that biden should step aside for similar but not identical reasons that 's why i find klein 's extremely strident stance and rhetoric about why biden should step aside compelling and indicative i do n't quite agree with him about most things but i agree with him about this and he expressed it well if someone far to the right of me but also still an influential democratic voice is saying these things publicly biden is cooked and that is depressing because i wanted this election to be easier for democrats as did he even if i have many critiques of democratic policy that he does n't share the thing we share is the correct perception that biden does n't have the political chops anymore to win this election because he is in fact senile and senility is his biggest political vulnerability at the same time has biden done a good job as president arguably yes is biden a viable politician anymore as contrasted with providing good governance through his good choices of non senile appointees no he will likely lose this election because he is senile because while you may consider him an effective president he is no longer a good politician and if he loses this election his appointees lose their power too for the good of the country and the world biden needs to step aside and allow a younger politician to take his place after an open convention if defeating trump is as vital as biden says it is and i agree it is just that vital he must step aside biden has proved beyond any doubt his senility after last night i am sorry to anyone still reeling and coping but that 's what it was and any average person could see it millions did you do n't have to be a medical doctor to see it biden 's senility is his biggest political vulnerability even if he 's done a decent job as president compared to the much more evil republican agenda and biden 's senility is no longer obsfuscatable or even arguable being a good politician is not the same as being a good president and biden is not a good politician but being a good politician is a prerequisite to being re elected completely apart from what his record is biden has fallen off so hard that it was shocking to many how poorly he did last night including myself including democratic diehards and i already had low expectations after watching his off the cuff performances in interviews over the last few months or year it is correct to say that biden 's performance last night was the worst performance in a presidential debate ever and it was the first debate which is always the most important and the notion that it does n't matter is cope because he proved to the biggest audience he will have in 2024 that the smears about his mental acuity are true
if they only watched 10 m of a 90 m debate that tells me they did n't care in the first place also why would you laugh at the media not showing biden 's speech today do you laugh when they show clips of trump 's speeches but not biden 's
debates have historically been irrelevant to the actual outcome hillary “ won ” all three debates obama was bad at 2012 debates they rarely predict how the election will go
sure he can november is a long time from now
what no one watches debates it was down like 35 million viewers from 2020 everyone watches debates please
the first presidential debate is typically the highest profile public appearance for both candidates in any election season
i was just responding to the fact that biden can not beat trump which is wrong since he already did
he was also not the incumbent
in my opinion that ’s not in the softest terms the way i said it was way softer imo i ’m acting like i think i think conservatives will take this headline and quotes from the headline and say “ even the librul nyt thinks biden shouldnt be president ” and that sentence i mentioned will simply be ignored and the nyt knows this i did n’t say anything about my knowledge of the election process compared to anyone else ’s especially not the political media ’s that ’s an interesting inference to draw from my post especially after saying i did n’t read the article dawg
maybe my perspective is different cuz i was born in a dictatorship but even an unappealing pro democracy candidate should be enough to motivate people to vote against someone with authoritarian tendencies with plans like project 2025
yeah that ’s a fair point
you are on reddit go to wikipedia and compare the records of the two if you consider pointing out character flaws as mud slinging i am not sure what to say he needed to differentiate himself
i remember when the polls said hillary had an 86 % chance to win the presidency in 2016 what ’s your point
you have no plan for the magical scenario that i mentioned above you did n't even notice or consider it so you can stop implying that you want what 's good for democrats unless you 're willing to give us your scenario how do we replace the guy who won the primaries and who is tied in the polls with someone else before the election
even joe scarborough biden 's biggest fan is talking about it along with apparently many democratic insiders acting like this is just nyt doing a hit piece is burying our heads in the sand
yeah not accurate to say everyone watches debates it is accurate to say that for any undecided voter out there they are way more likely to see biden in that debate than any rally or speech he does and he fucking blew that bad it does n’t matter how good he does at a rally or even immediately after the debate because undecided voters will not see that
does anyone honestly think that anybody tuned into that to help them choose who is worthy of their vote in november people watched to see the shitshow and for no other reason most i know watched to see how often trump would lie and violate the rules we were disappointed that biden did n't do the thing but biden 's performance gave no one a reason to prefer trump if they did n't already prefer trump and those troglodytes are never going to change anyway
what makes you think the crowd that would do that needs anything more than what they got from the debate itself 57 million people watched the debate all the trump campaign has to do is show clips of it next to clips from the 2020 debates election won you 're completely missing the forest for the trees
it wo n’t motivate people because trump is n’t a serious person it ’s also the third consecutive election of democrats running on “ we ’re not as bad as him ” after 8 years of this trying to scare people about trump just lost its power it ’s not difficult to run a young person who is moderately charismatic and can act like an actual human being the bar is so low that to stop fascism that ’s all we need yet the democrats are again forcing a clearly unpopular candidate on us worse this time it ’s clear biden is n’t in a condition to be president neither of these men should be running and as a result apathy has set in
i agree he needed to differentiate himself he failed fantastically
for now what the ever loving fuck is this headline
for now as long as it 's a choice between biden or a hitler wannabe we 'll stick by him forever
trump has much much less work to do if biden does n’t inspire people to actually get out and vote for him apathy can be real powerful in elections all it takes is for enough people to be apathetic about biden and we have another four years of trump the undecided voters in this election are n’t browsing r politics repeating “ but he ’s not a fascist like trump ” really only gets you so far believe me i think that ’s insane it should be enough but it ’s not dems have their work cut out for them
biden appeared far more animated than his showing the night before why seriously last night was game time i just saw a clip of him today and he was so much more energetic clear and loud could barely hear him last night
are you voting for joe biden if he remains our nominee i am period if so get out there and fight for every fucking vote because trump will turn democracy upside down day one if elected
biden appeared to acknowledge the criticism during a rally in raleigh north carolina saying ” i do n’t debate as well as i used to ” but he added “ i know how to do this job i know how to get things done ” speaking for 18 minutes biden appeared far more animated than he had the night before as he excoriated trump for his “ lies ” and for waging a campaign aimed at “ revenge and retribution ” in his almost fifty year career how many debates did he actually participate in i imagine there were many during his years in the senate there is a notable difference between biden 's response from their debates four years ago
why would a debate performance change my vote honestly have trump or biden ’s policies changed is trump any less of a criminal is project 2025 any less scary is the prospect of two more trump appointed supreme court justices any less likely is climate change any less of a pressing issue is the chevron doctrine dropping today any less of a threat with the rnc in charge is the right to an abortion any less of a pressing issue for my daughter in the future oh it is n’t because of one bad debate performance ok cool yeah still voting for biden
i ’m voting for biden because i feel i have no choice and i am sick and tired of feeling i have no choice in a democracy
love how this is supposedly the most important election ever and of utmost importance and yet we have to endorse a sundowning octogenarian that said he would have stepped down after one term yay
he desperately needs to schedule another debate before the convention the week before or something because if this is the impression that he left for most voters we are in serious trouble oh and do us all a favor and chug a liter of coffee before you get out there
people have been raising red flags about biden 's reelection chances for years and every time they were told by the party to sit down and get in line it took the worst debate performance in modern political history for the dnc to wake up to how much trouble their hubris got us into
imagine picking a candidate so bad that trump is the favorite 4 years after january 6
democrats would win this election by massive margins if they just replaced biden if the goal is to keep trump out of office they have no excuse to not replace
kind of wish he would do more on the defend democracy front honestly democracy has only eroded even more under his term while he has limited power he does n't offer any clear solutions besides just electing him it 'd be nice to hear some talk of scotus reform or pushing back against recent gop policies like teaching the bible in school or even just more talk about getting money out of politics
it ’d have been nice if the party did n’t privately threaten potential primary challengers instead they effectively closed the primary and withheld from voters the ability to decide on biden ourselves and now once again the party elites seek to suppress what dems across the country want for biden to withdraw from this race everything is coordinated nothing is organic wtf is this party
only one of the following two statements can be true 1 this is an existential election and democrats and the dnc must do everything they can to make sure they triumph over trump 2 joe biden must and should be the nominee
it ’s a good sign that he is openly admitting it in my opinion it at least gives a lot more hope that he will start addressing the issues that led to it i think the debate format sucks for him and luckily there is only one more if it happens if biden can do a ton of rallies where he is energized and speaking as clearly as he normally does which has never been perfect i think the case against trump and for biden can still be made effectively
52 days until the convention tick tock
it would be really nice if instead of the dnc asking us to betray our eyes and ears and circle the wagons around this sapless mummy because the stakes are too high they actually offered a candidate with a pulse this is n't something he 's just going to get better from there 's no cure for being old as fuck i know if you 're the type of person who watches the minority report or pod save america religiously that you 'd vote for sack of onions if it meant keeping trump out of the white house but if they think the casual consumers of politics the independents and the moderates feel that way you 're in for some 2016 level disappointment
let ’s be honest i ’m voting against trump
joe biden made a mistake and admits it trump refuses to take responsibility and always doubles down the choice is clear it 's america or trump
i 've known that he was prone to verbal gaffs for a long time but i think the majority of the blame is on those tools at cnn
honestly though the best thing for him to do if he ’s gon na stay in is get ahead of it and say he could have done better
biden 's halting delivery and meandering comments particularly early in the debate i mean given trump meanders like an absolute crazy man perhaps this will endear biden to trump 's supporters more seriously i guess it shows those on the democratic side of things have higher standards because that worries them but in the commentary since the debate i 'll be forever confused as to why there 's so many segments outside of trump 's base that do n't seem to hold him to remotely the same standards trump lied and meandered and engaged in constant substance less boasting but i see a lot of people go well yeah but that 's just trump being trump that he had more energy while lying means this is absolutely the worst for biden because he looked like the old man he is like it was an awful debate all round
until next week when trump is winning by 7 points in battleground states
i am hearing more talk that biden should step down right now than ever before but what would that even mean what happens when the candidate who is winning the primary elections drops out what happens at the democratic national convention in august dean phillips or marianne williamsen get named the nominee based on whatever scraps of votes they got in the primaries
good for him i thought it was gon na be a cope fest at least he admitted it hopefully he shows up in 2 but honestly trump not showing up for the other debates is probably his best move leaving this to be the only debate performance to judge biden on
a vote for trump is a vote to destroy america biden is n’t my first choice but for anyone who knows how elections work he is the only choice
i keep hearing yeah i 'll vote for biden but it 's the undecided voters we have to worry about guess who influences undecided voters decided voters each of us has to decide individually who we are voting for and why overly worrying about undecided voters means that you're not really decided and that indecision will be felt by others this wishy washy i 'm okay but means you 're not okay i 'm voting for biden on election day and i am fully committed to it and i have a raft of reasons why decide fully for yourself first commit to it then take action to help with campaigning donating talking to friends and family
when will people face reality the man is just too old for the job and it 's fine it 's okay this denial is why a literal crime wave walking is even still a viable candidate you have yourselves to blame
biden has been a solid president just sucks he is not the most impressive candidate in front of a camera
friends if you want to try and convince people maybe consider something like this approach i commented below on someone 's comment about not voting for biden see if this helps r whatbidenhasdone lists the things that biden 's presidency has done for the us if 90 minutes changed your mind about voting for biden then maybe you should look at what 3 5 years did here 's an ask spend 30 minutes 1 3rd the time you spent watching the debate if you watched the whole thing if you still feel the way you do fine bear in mind that a vote for president is a vote for the whole executive branch and there are a lot of amazing people tirelessly working to fix our country 's issues and maintain the things that make it good biden is easily in the top 20 presidents of all time maybe even top 10
dens will stick with him all the way to losing the presidency and two more supreme court picks
i have defended him and defended him i appreciate a lot of what he has done and the fact the he simply won in 2020 i will vote for him but i am disgusted that this is happening to this country it would be a bloodbath if they could pick a charismatic candidate that picked up where biden left off this is insanity
stick by him what fucking choice have we ever had we did n't want him in 2020 we do n't want him now but they 've given us zero options this two party system sure is fucked up
if he is going to keep running then the messaging needs to focus more on future supreme court nominees and local elections to get people out to vote because this is not going to inspire people who are not paying attention to politics local elections and supreme court decisions affect daily lives that needs to be reinforced into the messaging
as if we have a choice
i ’m still supporting biden he whiffed it last night but he was n’t a lying sack of hate
do people really watch debates to help decide who should be president if you do n’t know the difference between trump biden by now then there ’s no helping you
check nyt editorial board hold our beers
who the fuck is writing these headlines
this is the dumbest fucking headline and timeline if trump gets in we can kiss any semblance of a balanced supreme court not that it ’s even close to that right now goodbye for 30 years it ’s so much more than this stupid debate
forget novichok all russia needs between now and november is a steep flight of steps
absolutely and why change between the fantastic covid response bipartisan infrastructure spending handling of ukraine crisis inflation reduction act chips handling of debt ceiling crisis handling of baby formula crisis making lynching a fed hate crime making medicaid negotiate drug prices cheap insulin forgiving student loans and literally everything mentioned in r whatbidenhasdone i feel more at ease hopeful for the future with biden the democrats in charge of the fed government also in every state govt thank you president biden for level headed leadership that focuses on solving actual problems rather focusing on social media hysterics and for respecting democracy its institutions so not enabling authoritarianism biden vp harris already deserve 4 more years and democrats deserve complete control of congress and every state govt
worst headline i ’ve seen yet he won that debate by a ton
i ’ve been seeing articles all day with nonsense headlines dems are panicking no we are n’t dems want biden to step aside no not really dems stick by him for now um yeah that was always the plan
oh he concedes debate fumbles well fine nevermind our democracy is on the line due to a doddering fool
if he 's in it i m voting for him
we are so fucking cooked
its fucking june even if we swapped to the best candidate ever dems would lose because of this we have to stick with biden i wish we had a better candidate in 2020 but now we are stuck with him
yeah let ’s not have any more headlines that start “ biden concedes ”
i 'm not interested in presidential debates the only debates that a president is ever involved in are the the ones that they have to do to get re elected it 's not really a skillset needed to be a good chief executive a negotiator sure making speeches yes but debating is a skill for the legislative branch i did n't watch the debate i was n't going to watch the debate i know who i 'm voting for and i know why and there was n't going to be any new information presented that would alter my decision and if there was it would be in the news the next day biden had a bad night because he was fighting a cold does n't even twitch the needle on my position
who else is there the old felon f that
i d chose biden over wannabe hitler anyday mate anything to delay that fuck storm
personally i only saw the media call for biden ’s head none of the everyday people like me that i talked to want him to step aside was it his best performance definitely not imo the coverage has been very reactionary
click bait headline this is the kinda shit that scares my elderly liberal family because they see it and then think democrats are gon na support trump
switch from a man who 's been a good president to a man who has been ranked several times as the worst president in american history who is a convicted felon a rapist a racist who insults disabled people who insults the parents of a young man who gave his life in battle let me ask this i have a wart on my finger should i cut the other arm off
like what fucking choice do we have
i m proudly riden with biden hey when i m at work and screw up i have to own it he did that love joe allways all ways
so biden stays that means donald trump will become president i guess
how can anyone support either candidate they ’re both complete unsuited to the job
if he wins that man can sleep for the next four years i ’ll even volunteer to tuck him in and read him bedtime stories as long as he is n’t a convicted felon i ’m okay with the team he ’s put together continuing the job
i 'll stick with him no doubt
right over the cliff the man i saw onstage has no business running a country nor the other guy for that matter i must vote against trump but i really really really wanna vote for somebody else other than joe how tf is he gon na last another 4 years
“ the future of our country as we know it is at stake and if we do n’t win this one there might never be another election again so we ’ve decided to run a slack jawed reanimated corpse who struggled to put a complete sentence together for 90 minutes ” if democracy is really on the ballot why is joe biden if the dnc wants voters to take this election seriously they should probably have chosen a candidate that suggests they are too
this is fucked biden 's team has been saying how he 's great behind closed doors and on top of everything they are the ones who pushed this debate then he goes out there like this it was n't just a bad debate it 's a confirmation that he 's just too fucking old and it shows the incompetence of biden 's teams why the hell would they put him out there like that if this is how he looks i want trump to lose but this will cost biden a shitton of votes we need to pick a new candidate a walking corpse ca n't be the best thing we can come up with against a pathologic liar so disappointed
let 's be clear here the people voting for democracy and sanity are not going to vote for trump if biden is the only solution we have right now then so be it i 'm not voting for trump no fuckin way i 'd rather have an old confused man than a demented facist who wants to take my vote and rights away
we will stick by biden no matter what tfg is a fascist and nazi sympathizer that worships putin and dictators
oh democrats always willing to throw away the rights of the working class for the sake of decorum and tradition what do they care they 're not suffering the results of their political lameness fuck we need left leaning representation in the us
i am and forever will stick with biden
i do n't care how bad of a night biden has you could n't pay me to vote for trump biden is old but a good person who works for people 's best interests trump is a lunatic who only cares about himself the choice of who the next president will be should be fucking obvious and it 's crazy that it 's not
biden has dementia that was n't a debate fumble and we all know it we deserve a viable candidate this will end poorly lewy body dementia symptoms include fluctuating attention alertness these shifts can last hours or go on for days the person may stare into space appear lethargic or drowsy and have hard to understand speech appearing a lot like delirium at other times the person may have much more clarity of thought
my issue with the drop out crowd is are you actually gon na drag your asses out and vote if the candidate is kamala buttigieg castro because if you are just crying and whining without providing a solution you are nt actually helping
he is losing votes for not supporting palestine need newsom he will bring peace in the middle east
he had has a sore throat jet lag and he was facing a literal fire hose of misinformation that would be impossible to debunk unless he spent literally all of his time doing that which keeps him on the defensive 100 % of the time he 's fine
the guy is running against a dude who is about to be sentenced for almost three dozen felony convictions he could go into hibernation and sleep his way to a win this fall
why does n't biden move to the vp role and be hyped up as the experienced advisor to one of the democratic parties ' younger options president pete biden whitmer biden newsome biden
he will defend democracy by doing nothing other than not being named donald trump this whole “ threat to democracy ” is a pathetic attempt to get votes like the dems have no other great plan to improve our country or selling points for their governance other than “ we ’re not that orange fucker ” they have to result to baseless fear mongering did y’ all forget about our checks and balances trump ca n’t do shit to damage our democracy he would be stopped our country is in a sad sad state
that is not an acknowledgement that is what you say when you do n't really take accountability i 'm not as good as i used to be dude you were sleepy joe for the first half hour you woke up a little when it appeared you remembered one of your zinger lines you mumbled and stepped over yourself the closing statement was an embarrassment honestly if he said today as his closing statement that might have helped i am so frustrated i love joe and this physically hurt me i am stopping my regular donations that i 've been giving since he first started running the last time
yes dems stick with him he 's a joke that will drag down the entire ticket
biden is done and so are democratic ’s hopes of winning this election unless they smarten up trump was leading in all battleground states pre debate and now that is secured unless biden is booted bootbiden
that “ for now ” is the bullet the democrats put through their head every time it ’s fucking painful being on the left
profiting off of creating chaos as per usual
the media is clamoring for a trump win nothing sells like chaos
drama from an outlet that wants to sell papers clicks
it ’s now or never so never i guess
the media do n't seem to realize that we 'd vote for the turd that killed elvis over the small handed orange rapist
the old folks will stay young ’s simply wo n’t vote
the headline is ridiculous because their confidence has already left him in droves it seems like half of the democratic party is telling him to step aside for good reason
the dude could n't string together a sentence step down or lose democracy
it 's literally reads like sports
spewing bullshit for clicks and to keep pushing the horse race these are people who have written articles about biden getting good legislation passed as being bad for him so
watch on msnbc tonight he explains the structural reasons why biden will not be replaced by anyone one example was fundraising the governors who might be worthy candidates do not have a penny in fundraising to pay for that vast complicated thing that is a presidential campaign this is n't like putting up one of those dome tents a 5 minute job
i 'd vote for biden over trump even if he was dead
one bad night by the president did not convince me that trump is our savior
we need news media reform we need tons of reform
people forget biden has competent people in his cabinet which will keep the country moving forward trump will again bring the biggest evil grifters like his last term
the problem with this kind of thinking is ignoring the very real prospect of potential democratic voters just staying home more and more the discourse is turning into “ both sides bad ” again and instead of giving soft democrats soft republicans independents undecideds confidence in his abilities he is forcing them to make a very difficult choice between a criminal and someone who is not up to the job it does n’t matter that he looked better at the rally or in the spin room last night there are voters who made their minds up last night in the first 10 minutes of that debate and clips of it will be played ad nauseum from now until election day people staying home is what sunk clinton in 16
you may moderates and independents wo n't
well there should be another option than hitler or dementia
in the article it explains that the alternative would be replacing biden on the ballot not voting for trump
you will but will unenthusiastic voters in swing states show up for the biden the world saw last night
that s not the decision they are considering
if it 's a choice between a well meaning but sometimes forgetful old man and an ill meaning spiteful vengeful old hitler wannabe gee tough choice s
his cold seemed to clear up quick
sundowning cognitive impairments among the elderly are worse at night and the debate started at 9 pm
you could tell he was just debating the same bullet points he had rehearsed beforehand and when he lost his train of thought he would just repeat the bullet point verbatim it was just sad and depressing to watch elder abuse on a nationally televised scale it was even more depressing watching trump just vomit lies for an hour and a half straight and no one present checked him or refuted anything he said instead we got a heated actual coherent argument about golf handicaps the number one issue on the mind of the average american voter
bill maher said it best voting for biden even if it ’s just his head in a jar
unless you ’re a complete idiot if you ’re truly a progressive then you ’re gon na vote for the most progressive candidate with the chance to win every election unfortunately our country is filled with idiots
sigh if every democrat that usually votes still votes for biden then he loses biden needs to mobilise youth and women voters who do n’t have a history of voting especially in battleground states he actively did the opposite of that last night with completely unforced errors the covid pandemic mobilised people for him last time and it was still bloody close this time he needs to do it himself and he is utterly failing stop the delusion and support him to step aside and put his weight behind someone else
like he did last time he was elected
your vote is n't the issue the issue is getting the many unenthusiastic biden voters in the swing states to show up biden 's performance will depress democrat turnout and harm down ballot candidates if biden remains the candidate not only will the presidency likely to be lost but there is an increased chance of congress becoming republican as well
it ’s this for me as well to be clear i wish there was a candidate other than biden on the democratic ticket but there is n’t and wo n’t be biden has accomplished a lot in his four years and that ’s in large part to the people he surrounded himself with who are n’t sycophants eager to live out a christofascist or libertarian dream i do n’t want an edith wilson scenario between 2025 2028 but considering the supreme court just today overturned the chevron doctrine and their ruling on what is considered “ obstruction ” are fundamentally going to change how the us is operated and with a potential two more supreme court picks in the next term i ’ll vote for the party of stability for all i ’m not saying biden would be the same as woodrow wilson but it ’d be silly to say it ca n’t happen if he ’s reelected and gets to 86 in office
yeah but he 's old though so i guess that makes it even s clearly
comments like these are so willfully naive your opinion on policy is not what matters here what matters is how many people get out to vote for years biden has been really struggling to convince voters he is n't too old for the job and last night he just confirmed in front of the entire country all of the negative things that people were concerned about good luck getting people out to vote now
what do you expect for the democratic party to finally prioritize election reform that allows a more representative nominee that would motivate their voters and non voter across the board solidifying their presence in our government so they can finally try and enact their proposed sweeping changes that they 've been dangling in front of voters for decades and re enact the foundational progress that has been stripped away by our current supreme court
look at it this way no matter what we will have a fresh choice next election that was n't guaranteed this time around we largely knew it would be a rematch we have to push through one more election and we will have the freedom to pick again trump may try to run again from prison in 2028 who knows but we will get to actually pick the democratic nominee in 2028 we have one more election playing annoying politics one more to get through we all know how bad it will be if democrats do n't win this election we all knew trump 's first term would be bad but it was worse than everyone 's expectations imagine a second term one more election and we can start a clean slate with new candidates
almost like the dnc does n't believe their own rhetoric about trump ushering in eternal fascism cool well maybe pick someone to face trump other than the shambling dementia golem then
when did he say that provide the quote i ’ll wait
i would n’t do a debate i would suggest a town hall have a single moderator and a group of democrat republican and independent voters who would ask biden questions if he does well it can show how he can answer voters and their concerns face to face something that trump either wo n’t or ca n’t do
only problem with that is trump might not want to do another debate because he got what he needed from this one
literally zero chance of trump agreeing to another debate it would be like us winning the lottery and then being asked if we wanted to go double or quits on the next week 's numbers
it ’s too late the one issue he needed to reassure people on was whether his age was affecting him those clips show that he is n’t there at least some of the time and ca n’t campaign or stay on message they will be used all election cycle and every time it will remind voters how sad this is he gave trump his best reeelection tool there ’s no undoing what happened it was his chance and he blew it by proving that every single concern about his age was valid no one will engage further with it and the more we try to convince independents that it ’s not as bad as it looked the more they begin to question our judgement and motivations if we ’re blatantly lying about what we all saw this makes them check out since they largely hate trump but now the democrats are telling them not to believe their own eyes the only way forward is a clean slate
who says they 're awake now imo their game plan was to get biden over the finish line in november replace him with harris and then try the it 's an incumbent we ca n't possibly have a competitive primary ploy in 2028
it 's the same idiots in charge as 2016 the dnc is a hopeless corrupt inept organization nobody should be surprised they learned absolutely nothing the left wing needs to decide if they want to get serious and start a real grassroots movement to create an actual left wing party because the dnc is not it at this point and is almost directly responsible for this trump mess we are in
can you provide me some proof of the dnc doing or saying anything about biden running all i saw was no one of consequence run against him in the primary
worst debate performance in history yeah from trump biden addressed a few issues well enough and made some cogent points it was a terrible performance but it was not anywhere near as bad as trump 's
he was just chosen because he was the only one polling high enough in the 2020 primary to defeat sanders
biden already beat trump you should ask can he do it again
who do you think can beat trump
with who though anyone specific i can think of would have some issues and would n’t have nearly as much name recognition and it ’s kinda late to start up a whole primary campaign
would they replacing a candidate mid election cycle is unheard of
biden is going to win anyway as if trump convinced anyone to switch their vote or vote for him
the fact that garland still has a job means he is n't taking the whole ' defending democracy ' thing seriously smith should have been appointed special counsel on january 21st three years ' delay is going to cost us everything
very excited to reward them for these actions by not voting
i think 2 is easy to say when there is a blank slate who would be the nominee all of the possibilities i can think of would be far from unanimously liked and or would n’t have very much name recognition amongst swing voters
few democrats in positions of power actually believe statement 2 at this point however because obama and others but really obama have come out in biden ’s defense it is potentially career damaging to persist in calling for biden to step down and so career over country will prevail again and the politicians staffers and operatives who were all ready to discard biden will now support him again at no point in these gymnastics orchestrated by party brass are the actual voters ’ views consulted who by the way have been firmly anti biden for many many months even before the catastrophic polling set to come out of the debate nightmare
i ’d argue neither is true honestly
replacing the democratic candidate at this point is a complete fantasy
why can only one of those statements be true just because you say so they can both be true
i do n't think 2 is necessary true but no one stepped up to run against him now did they
we can fight it out there or joe can step up and step down with his endorsed replacement at his side
you realize there is n’t some secret illuminati democrat cult behind closed doors that decides everything right it ’s just a committee that holds fundraisers biden ran in the primary and won that ’s why he ’s our nominee because voters chose him
yup that ’s the core of biden ’s voters anti trump votes and those voters will turn out and vote for whoever the democratic nominee is even if it ’s someone like harris or whitmer or shapiro or beshear etc those votes are locked in what biden has lost is millions of swing voters who had concerns about him and now wo n’t vote at all or maybe might vote 3rd party or only vote the down ballot races last night he needed to prove to those voters that the reports about him being mentally unfit were exaggerated and that he ’s fine then they would ’ve happily proceeded to vote for him in november but instead he proved to them the opposite and now many of them will not vote for him very few will vote for trump but he ’s lost millions of votes now a new democratic candidate would retain all of biden ’s current votes especially if he endorses the replacement heavily it ’s anti trump votes so they ’ll still vote anti trump but that new candidate would at least have a shot at winning back the millions of voters that have become disillusioned with biden due to his mental acuity the middle east conflict or inflation with biden i do n’t see a winning path forward with a new candidate i think a winning path remains possible
this is exactly what i came here to say it takes a big man to admit when they are wrong or makes a mistake trump is not that guy joe is surrounded by great people who are scandal free and takes their advice trump again is not that guy also i would like for someone to explain to me how a convicted felon can work with other nations when some of them would n’t even allow him to enter their country as a felon for that matter he could n’t get a job as a bank teller or a dealer in a casino as a felon he ca n’t even get a loan in his own home town but some people want to give him the nuclear codes
hell no it ’s not lmao “ my opponent that beat me last election dropping out meaning i have to run against someone who was n’t directly elected that has even lower approval than biden that basically no one knows anything about oh nooooo ” you wanna know what would happen if biden resigned and someone else replaced him nothing because all of the “ sundowning ” idiots were accusing hillary of being a corporate shill warmonger back in 2016 they ’ve already made up their minds they do not give a single solitary fuck about politics all they care to know is “ both sides bad ” and that ’s it they were around under obama they were around under bush they were around under clinton and they ’ve been around in our current day biden resigning would n’t hurt trump at all it would hurt the democrats to lose one of the most aggressive progressives of our time just because he fumbled one fucking debate
translation our attempt to make the election more nail biting to sell more ads is n't going the way we wanted so we 're backing off to prepare for the next chance to create drama enjoy a short rest eyeball holders
it 's the same thing as if the presumptive nominee dropped out for health reasons on the first vote the pledged delegates will all vote for biden but he ca n't receive the nom so no running candidate will receive 50 % and it goes into the next round of votes it 'll be an open convention and other names would be accepted that 's also when superdelegates would be able to vote as well say a handful of names are put forward harris newsom whitmore pete b and the votes split the delegates there 's be negotiation and debate within groups of delegates perhaps speeches and a kind of campaigning for votes then another round of votes keep going until someone 's 50 % then ideally all of the possible nominated people loudly endorse the winner and the new chosen candidate makes a big floor speech then it 's a scramble to shift the campaign apparatus over to the new candidate change staff where needed create a new strategy to make america comfortable with the new person explain their position on everything and fight trump as much as possible look unified and stable and maybe win in november
biden represents the status quo existential threats to democracy do n't need status quo he 's had 4 years to do anything and instead we are back to 2020
you know they ’ll just do kamala which will be the worst choice woman president is still a hard sell let alone a woman of color even if biden does n’t drop out people are effectively just voting for his vp now i ’d be surprised if he makes it through all 4 years even if he does win maybe a year or two tops
biden was not my first choice but he won the nomination he has done a great job he will continue to do a great job our job is to vote for him
but one is going to win and despite obvious faults one is worse than the other
me too but american democracy is on the line we need someone strong enough to win this policy does not win at this point those who care about that are already voting dem we need someone who is n't worse off looking than trump biden is not that he needs to step down and endorse whitmer if she is willing these discussions need to be happening this weekend biden will not beat trump no time to wait until the next poll cycle he needs to step up and step down he had never even been ahead of trump outside of a few polls within moe before this disaster he is toast and so is democracy if he does not pass this fight on to someone capable of beating a felon traitor senior citizen
i 'll vote for biden if i must but at the same time it 's also true that especially after last night he is likely to lose the election because i 'm not everyone he spent almost the entire duration of the first debate possibly the highest profile public appearance during the campaign proving that his biggest political liability his age and apparent senility is truly relevant and not exaggerated i want democrats to win in november and that 's why biden should step aside to make room for another candidate likelier to win my top choices would be newsom or whitmer
i commented on another thread about newsom and already received the negativity
he has a week off to prepare and spare us that he had to deal with trump lies he told more than his share of whoppers last night too all while giving off strong dementia vibes
stop acting like we did n’t all see what we all saw it ’s over
lol he s been hiding at camp david resting up for days
no he 's fucked the country now thinks he is a senile old man stop coping
he spent a week at camp david preparing
his answer on abortion last night should be the end of his campaign the single most effective issue for democrats and the single worse issue for trump and he talks about illegal immigration it was so mind numbingly stupid the democratic party should ’ve confronted him last night and told him to quit
all the polls after the conviction showed trump still in the overall lead leading in five out of six swing states and gaining in the last one after that debate trump is going to have a very healthy buffer
so just ignore the polls then this sub is so dense
remember during the run up to the 2020 election trump and ' conservative ' talking heads kept saying that biden is scared and hiding in his basement then biden dunked on his ass handily won the election and headlines read ' trump loses to guy in basement ' pepperidge farms remembers
i once worked at the hq of a prominent gun distributor this was during the hillary v trump election imagine my surprise when i found out that the very republican right wing owners had two business plans one where trump won and one where hillary won the night of the election they were fully planning on hillary winning and loving the idea due to the positive impact it would have on business trump wins and they were disappointed that actually impacted their bottom line negatively and fucked with their forecasts i offer this anecdotal story as evidence you may think reporters and journalism outlets want to report the news i thought this company did n’t want possible 2nd amendment restrictions i was wrong i was thinking in 2d chess they were not
the bourgeois want trump to win
they 'll be patting themselves on the back about how great their ratings are as trumps goons round them up for the reeducation camps
they want something to sell it ’s not a real story but it will generate clicks this is part of what ’s wrong with our democracy
hell did you see the debate stage they were announcing it like a fucking sporting event
well if biden stays in the race another trump win is what you are going to get i do n't know who would be better but him staying in is tremendously foolish
msnbc is not individual anchors and reporters and the network as a whole have been called out by for retribution if he 's re elected
the people who want joe to stay in the race are clamoring for trump to win any candidate that can consistently form complete sentences would best trump
my brain went “ hold up is there a conspiracy that biden killed elvis ” and then i reread ur post
in his golden throne on terra
at his age that 's a very real possibility also voting for biden i 'd vote for a petri dish of syphilis over trump
if either one was dead
no doubt these headlines today make it seem like somehow losing a debate with someone who did n't actually debate but lied is somehow spelling out the end of biden if biden loses we lose democracy seems a pretty easy choice if you actually believe in the constitution and not just the parts you cherry pick
you no me neither but undecided voters best case scenario they abstain and yeah you 're gon na tell me it 's a very small segment etc etc but with the electoral college an election can easily be decided by less than 50 000 votes
you should n’t think of presidents as saviors they ’re basically interns
it 's been a lot of bad nights though i mean trump will always be garbage made flesh but we could nominate a different democrat
what about the 3 and a half years since he is president one bad night what
people do n’t forget this it ’s just a very bad look that we ’re even at this point where the reason to vote for biden is that the people he hires are competent and will do their best to make sure his cognitive decline does n’t affect his work like even having this argument means we ’ve lost it ’s time to cut those losses and move on
yeah pres biden ’s cabinet did a great job pulling out of afghanistan
so you think people made up their minds in the first ten minutes to look at biden and trump and think meh not voting for either of them sorry but anyone in that category was minimally motivated to ever vote for biden to begin with i think there ’s actually an opposite force at work the more republicans see and hear trump the more they remember how insufferable he is people already know biden is old
then those people who stayed home deserve the consequences of their apathy and ignorance unfortunately the rest of us will go down the tubes with them
we 've got four months to work on that
this needs to be the message look what happens when you stay home you get health care and abortion access revoked supreme court justices that are corrupt and project 2025 if he is n't leaving focus on the importance of local elections the house and senate as that impacts daily life
i 'm voting for biden no matter what or anyone else who is n't trump but i could only watch about 30 seconds of that debate last night before realizing that biden is really in bad shape and it was too painful to even continue watching i have to think a significant portion of undecideds are gon na see that and say trump is horrific but at least he 's awake and standing upright
i used to be a republican i ’ll stick by joe until hell freezes over
moderates and independents with probably just stay home that ’s enough to sink biden ’s campaign
there is nothing moderate about supporting trump
i 'm an extreme af moderate and i 'm all in for biden
moderates and progressives are all supporting biden
dang you should open up a polling agency or something as you seem to know exactly what hundreds of millions of people think
unless dems decide to put up a different candidate he does n't have my vote and i voted for him in the last election he is mentally unfit to lead the country and do n't whataboutism me
this swing voters just got lost
agreed the choices are pathetic but the choice is clear
there is n’t this is the choice in november
idk i think they both agree on palestinian genocide
i do n’t think anyone is arguing against that point except biden and the dnc clarification i agree both choices are horrible options
replacing biden on the ballot essentially guarantees a trump win so there is no difference in your two statements
if that ’s the case he should live a while in a different time zone for the next one
no one present checked him or refuted anything he said biden fucking refuted him with every single rebuttal after that first commercial break anyways
ageism rears its ugly head
his brain has been operated on twice major open brain surgeries what fresh conspiracy hell is this
and reading a prewritten script is vastly easier i 'd suck ass in a debate but i could do well reading a prewritten speech
and after last night 's performance better get that jar ready may as well finish that quote there 's no point sugar coating how bad he did
there was exactly one time in my life that i abstained from voting because i was dissatisfied with the quality of the two main party candidates that was 2016 never ever again
the only saving grace is trump motivates a lot of them against him biden has time to make it up if last night was in fact an exception vs the rule
you mean the time where he repeatedly denied the results of an election and tried to have it overturned even calling a state official to ask for him to find enough votes to make trump win or when he held back the national guard while a mob that he had whipped up stormed the us capitol at least some of whom were openly calling for the deaths of officials including trump 's own vp because those seem pretty antithetical to democracy just saying
right if this was a choice between two sane candidates in two sane parties then yeah that debate would have affected my decision quite a bit honestly now i do n’t see the decision like that but the swing voters apparently do so that ’s what is troubling
i saw a poll today that moderates are now more for biden after the debate dnc also had their best single night of fundraising i guess trump lying the entire time did n’t woo them so much guess we ’ll see in the coming days
this dems need moderates and a decently enthusiastic turnout biden can not deliver that if democracy is really on the line we need a candidate strong enough to fight for it anecdote i have several middle right leaning friends who would rather vote for anyone before trump anyone but a senile barely cogent person
i made a list of all the reasons i ’m still voting for biden there ’s likely some overlap but i do n’t expect my politics to match everyone ’ else ’s nevertheless there is still a very compelling case for biden and against trump one bad night does not define who he will be the full term so at the end of the day dnc needs to do the work to convince voters the biden administration ’s policies are what ’s best for america and draw a stark contrast between their goals and whatever the fuck trump wants to do project 2025 shudders
frankly those higher up in the dnc and their donors will be fine in a fascist society the rest of us wo n’t
other than the literal president
i think they do believe but also are narcissistic to the point they believe only the guy they already picked can beat trump
i do n’t know that he said it it was his campaign
i thought that was the plan one term and hand things over to a vp giving dems 12 years to straighten some things out but kamala harris was chosen as vp she was never very popular i ’m not crazy about her four more years of biden was about the only choice after the 2020 election i would have loved elizabeth warren as vp a bernie warren ticket would have been my best dream i do n’t know if there was any chance that would have been electable so here we are
it 's an easy google search here you go
he has zero incentive to even show up for the one he already agreed to
he bankrupt a casino he ’s obviously not good at gambling
they could ve done that in 2023 but did n’t
look what they did to bowman which makes them complicit in genocide in my opinion but i digress joe has a rare moment where he can be the dominate and deciding voice in that clown car deals need to be made and fast
nobody ran against him because the party pressures people not to challenge incumbents
wow it really is 2016 all over again hi bernie bros it 's been a minute
100 % but most democrats refuse to acknowledge it sanders was poised to run away with the 2020 nomination unless biden ran no one else stood a chance
i hope so i doubt we will have another choice if he is still the nominee he has my vote the alternative is far worse
definitely not after last night
he barely beat him electoral college wise
if you actually watched that debate last night and still consider that biden can win the election i do n't even know what to say
no i do n't think he will
can he finish a complete sentence
someone the dems have spent the last 4 8 years prepping for the role they ve been doing that right right
whitmer or newsom most likely
i think the first question we got ta ask is can joe biden beat trump at this point because if the answer is no then we got ta look elsewhere
it 's why we are supposed to have primaries
in a debate a motivated slug or perhaps a persistent shrimp
i 'd say literally any generic democrat but that 's not true the list of people who could replace him at this time is short
as a republican i would be worried about newsom michelle obama and that 's about it
most centrist democrats would probably have beaten him i ’m not sure how it will play out if these is an 11th hour switch
andy beshear easily he ’s teflon none of the republican slander would work against him independents and centrists would vote for him over trump
literally anyone but biden and hrc
anybody the only reason biden won the first time was a strong anti trump turn out which is a wave anybody can ride
less name recognition is better imo name recognition can mean that people already made up their minds long ago with 4 months to go and the fact that independents largely seem exhausted and checked out and concerned with both candidates age biden just confirmed those fears are very much valid means that any semi competent younger person would easily run away with this election the democrats need someone quickly to step up it ca n’t be biden or kamala at this point newsom and whitmer seem like the obvious choices but there are others as well i think people keep looking at this election as if it ’s about voting for biden or trump when it ’s really about making sure independent voters come out independents clearly do n’t want trump but when their other option is what we saw last night they ’re likely to just stay home a younger decent candidate who is even semi charismatic would destroy trump and we can finally be rid of this nonsense political era why are we making it harder to win what should be a slam dunk it ’s baffling
gavin newsom would probably be the best choice personally i live in ca and do n’t particularly care for him but he is really good at the whole messaging thing and has been in the public eye a lot over the last couple years my pick in a full primary season would probably be gretchen whitmer but there probably is n’t enough time to get the same level of buzz around her as gavin if they wanted they could do things the old fashioned way at the convention instead of in primaries party can release the delegates and the backroom deals can happen i would be surprised if they do that though
but a debacle like that debate is also unheard of desperate times call for desperate measures and at this point i think almost any other option would be an improvement
many share this misconception it 's never been about switching candidates as much as it is about whether the voter turnout will be low enough in swing states as to enable trump to prevail a lesson that should have been learned in 2016
he is n't he was losing in the polls and almost every swing state before the debate trump will get a massive boost from this
anecdotal but every person i 've spoken to today has said they ca n't support biden after that performance and there 's now polling coming out in my blue state nj showing trump with a slight lead 538 was showing trump with a 1 % lead in nj even before the debate
after the debacle last night there is no way anybody can say that biden will win with suck conviction he looked ans sounded absolutely terrible i could n't understand half of what he said
the fact that gorsuch still has a job means he is n't taking the whole ' defending democracy ' thing seriously how would biden remove gorsuch lol
i see people with this attitude of let 's punish the dnc a little and force them to change perspective and i could get behind it if the conservatives were n't so far gone yall are playing the if the dnc wo n't go left or otherwise be less controlling on the process i wo n't vote game when imo we should be playing the if the republicans wo n't chill the fuck out with the con men grifters propaganda and disrespect we will all vote blue no matter who and they 'll never win another election game
wow what a dumb way to engage with the party
how there is a process in place that can easily achieve this
i 'm guessing you missed the debate last night lucky
things have changed you miss the debate last night
jill will never let that happen
you can bury your head in the sand and tell yourself what you saw last night was just a bad day because he had a cold i personally do n't want the dems to lose the election and the dismissive when the chips are down you 'll vote for him because you have to attitude i 'm seeing from democrats today is a losing strategy
ronald reagan bill clinton and barrack obama had poor debate performances they picked themselves up and kept going
i think it ’s a little more nuanced than you indicate
i ’m not sure they will also i ’m not sure who “ they ” is i mean is it not gon na have to be joe biden who ultimately decides i am just so blown away by what a disaster this is
our job i mean i will since the system is broken and trump is the other choice but this ' duty ' that we have feels broken as the administration does all kinds of things i do n't support i have to support them tariffs on evs from china making enviromentally friendly cars more expensive for americans to prop up the auto industry sending money to israel to kill palestinians having embarrassing mental faculties in the debate i do n't want any of this and that 's just a start we have to work so hard to get people to vote for democratic candidates because they are n't any good won the nomination was n't even another name on my ballot the idea that he ' won ' anything when the party is going to punish anyone who runs against him and has the inertia and capital to make that basically impossible is pretty much a laugh
that ’s a stupid reason to vote for someone who ’s clearly incompetent for the job not voting is better than voting for either of these two idiots
it 's only over if people do n't vote
lol okay his polling is up after the debate
democratic wins are a gold mine for gun makers and sellers they never actually take everyone 's guns or even really try but republicans keep telling their base that the democrats are going to and that fear drives sales
right and it ’s happening again with organizations left right and center now that think another trump term would help their bottom line
why would gun companies want less 2a restrictions when more regulation requirements mean more works they can do and more things they can charge people for a profit
this is the thing that baffles me most do n't they know that trump hate the media he has talked before about wanting to lock up journalists ratings are n't going to mean a whole lot if trump makes it back into the wight house and starts arresting them all
we already had 4 years of trump no reeducation camps that ’s hysteria i ca n’t stand trump but that kind of stuff is the same thing conservatives say biden would do
i do n't know who would be better this right here is why removing him is an awful idea
you are n't paying attention everybody knows that was the clintons
the grim darkness does n't seem so far now
is n't trump essentially a petri dish of syphilis
take it easy let ’s hope it does n’t come to that
if someone is so uninformed at this point that they would even consider voting for trump then they are n't going to make an effort to get out and vote anyway imo what i hope to see are republicans who are super embarrassed and do n't want to vote for trump again they would never vote for biden but they might stay home
on reddit for 60 days
if his people were so good they would putting the country first now and urging him to drop out
yeah because trump 's cabinet did such a great job negotiating it
well we got out of it did n't we
it 's the minimally motivated voters who decide elections if all that mattered was whether the dedicated base was going to vote or not no one would bother campaigning because hardcore dems will always vote blue and hardcore republicans will always vote red
talking to people outside the democratic bubble says otherwise most people in the country are n’t partisans and they have a poor view of the economy increasing gdp rising standard of living and frankly do n’t know much about biden ’s accomplishments so far modern presidential elections are decided on the edges by “ sometimes ” voters and also by driving turnout apathy kills democrats up and down the ballot it ’s easy for us to be frustrated and say “ well we should n’t care about their vote ” but the truth is that trump is n’t gaining voters biden is losing ground with his own
i understand the sentiment but that attitude is part of the problem
or the democrats could run a candidate that ’s actually liked and has a message that is n’t “ well i ’m clearly not making it through the next 4 years and my cognition has declined to an alarming degree but i ’m not a fascist like the other guy ” while that ’s true and i ’ll clearly vote for him if he somehow still is the nominee that is n’t a winning message the democrats won big with “ hope and change ” they took a risk on an untested new guy who technically lost the primary in the popular vote and pledged delegates that messaging gave one of the biggest modern electoral landslides the democrats have had why do we want to be in this place where we ’re arguing about why biden ’s health is n’t nearly as bad as it seems and we have to vote for him cause trump is bad there are candidates who do n’t have that baggage are n’t old and can run on a positive and relatable message a message that actually gives people a reason to vote for them and not just against someone else hell the biden and harris campaign website does n’t even have policy listed it ’s just endless donation tabs that ’s a terrible look the people have been shouting this at the democrats for 9 years now and they still do not get it we need stronger candidates who inspire passion if biden somehow wins then that means kamala is very likely our candidate in 2028 and depending on when if she becomes potus also possibly 2032 do we really want 16 years and 4 election cycles of democrats propping up a clearly weak candidate and begging people to just vote for them because they ’re not cartoonishly evil so our next chance for a “ good ” democratic candidate is 2036 that ’s not good enough and it should n’t be for anyone who wants to actually win this is the future of our party and the country at stake and continually voting in out of touch elderly people despite all of the warnings that this wo n’t go our way is actually insane
that certainly seems to be the idea the dnc biden campaign seems to have let ’s see how it works
we ’ve been working on it for 4 years another 4 months ai n’t going to help time to cut the losses and spend those 4 months advancing someone with the cognitive abilities to actually win
this want the delusional in this sub do n’t understand i imagine the average age in this sub must be pretty low to be so naive
awesome good for you i think there may be more than 1 moderate in america
president biden won in 2020 by 43 000 votes you do n’t need hundreds of millions just a handful of people to stay home
probably using every election ever as evidence tbf
ah yes a capable person with capable administration behind him lost your vote because he 's too old but all the shit trump has done has n't sent you to the polls makes a lot of sense and do n't whataboutism me do n't f around and you wo nt find out
unless dems decide to put up a different candidate he does n't have my vote and i voted for him in the last election he is mentally unfit to lead the country and do n't whataboutism me you were going to vote for biden before the debate
except he ’s not one bad debate does n’t mean he ’s unfit
if one of the choices is more of the same progress we 've seen this past year it 's not a pathetic choice at all biden could die in office of old age and his team would continue to be awesome that 's the magic of delegation and belonging to a competent party it 's a team effort the other choice is a narcissist sociopath who believes he alone is king it 's not a difficult decision unless you 're groomed to want a king it 's important to get out and vote regardless as congress needs our help just as much if not moreso we 're not going to see this corrupt scotus addressed without number in congress to push back
yes speak with your vote that these choices are unacceptable by voting for neither totally agree
i was surprised that trump refused comment on israel when asked instead he used his time to return to the ukraine question i missed part of the second half so maybe the subject came up again
yeah but one will give bibi a stern talking to so
i mean i agree but there 's still a difference imagine the extreme for example if a candidate actually died you would want to replace them instead of voting for the other guy
after last night running biden almost guarantees the kind of unenthusiastic base that sunk clinton
it must be night wherever you are
agism is saying old people ca n't do things agism is not pointing out when old people do old people things
it ’s not ageism it ’s using your eyes
fuck old people who ca n't let go of power
yeah i thought the same and looked it up he had two brain surgeries for aneurysms over 30 years ago
hahah you ’re too right about that still voting for him though
that sentence was about as coherent as biden speech at the debate it is just unfortunate that biden has a terrible night and the false narrative that has been perpetuated about biden declining mental state was reinforced in a big way you have news outlets playing cropped videos and short clips out of context making it seem like biden does n’t know where he is or what he is saying when in reality that is far from the case but the debate last night only further that narrative
this was actually one of the things that the political channel beau of the fifth column said trump needed to do a charm offensive and he could n't do it instead the modrates saw him lying openly and being extremely incoherent that pushes them away
dean fucking phillips apparently the guy nobody had ever heard of who thought he was the chosen one to prevent a second trump term
the campaign certainly gave the impression but opened the door for biden to change his mind without technical breaking a promise that ’s politics for you
did no one read this article it was an anonymous staffer and the follow up article has biden refuting it
i do n’t see a biden quote saying he would be a one term president you shared an opinion piece no biden quote
trump is a narcissist he believes he will win the next debate and there s a good chance he will show up so he can be declared winner again
declaring bankruptcy for a business does n't mean you lose money it means other people lose money
bowman got primaried because he 's a weirdo 9 11 conspiracy guy and the fire alarm stunt
name one or show an example otherwise you are full of it very rare to run against an incumbent and you know it
what points did trump make
oh no we could have had better healthcare
exactly this time he 's got ta win convincingly or there will be lawsuits and they 'll figure a way to get it all the way to scotus and they 'll happily do their own bush v gore and give trump the win
he can if people actually vote for him the other choice is trump to anyone in the rest of the world your choice consists of one bit very good one and one fucking insane fascist on his way to a dementia sundown leaving fuck knows who in charge there is n’t a choice doddery old grandpa who is n’t a fascist please america yes he ’s shit the other guys ends your democracy and the american experiment
i said i hope so and if he is the nominee i will vote for him i will vote for who ever is the nominee and right now that is biden
people generally forget occasions after 3 weeks the repubs will hammer the debate hard in ads there wo n’t be much forgetting dems will have to be relentless on orange man there ’s plenty of awfulness there we see lots of ugly visuals with his current wife smacking his hand away making disgusted faces when she is with him that ’s his wife a spouse usually is the one that knows a person the best and facts she wo n’t even be seen in public with him that ’s before anyone looks at jared
i keep seeing this i ’m in flyover country the only thing i know about newsom is that he was married to juniors girlfriend the way she looks now would make me question his judgement if he were the choice i would vote against tfg but i ’m more behind joe right now i ’m pretty well read on politics i know a little about whitmer but not a lot its biden this time we need to put our energy behind him and stop running in all directions
but the democrats do n’t have primaries anymore the party elites chose hillary over bernie in 2016 and now no primary if they choose someone else at the convention not a good look for the party defending democracy to not have had a fair and formal primary process in 2 out of the last 3 presidential general elections
it is true any randomly selected democratic governor or senator would have a much better chance than biden
hey i 'll take hillary now
would actually be a better option than any politician
they went over potential replacements polling earlier harris pete whitmer newsom all bad at this point either help biden win or go get on the trump train
anybody the only reason biden won the first time was a strong anti trump turn out which is a wave anybody can ride there were plenty of anybody else back then they could n't ride that wave but biden did
i think pritzker would be the best he ’s turned around the state of illinois
not really presidents have had bad debates then won the election
every person i ’ve talked to still supports biden
garland slip of the tongue
a perfect strategy to allow the right wing dnc party to do whatever the fuck they want to the 99 9 % poorest of us masterfully crafted and working great also it ’s literally not even going to prevent trump again failing on all conceivable fronts
i 'd love if you were right biden steps aside someone younger and more in touch steps up democracy is saved for another term i think that 's just unrealistic though the dnc has a track record and to me that record does n't remotely indicate they 'll accept a different nominee
i 'm voting for biden in the general election
i did watch it no it was not pretty biden ’s old and had an off day but i ’m still supporting him for his character policies and accomplishments
did you miss the words i wrote no one ran against him so he 's the nominee do you understand how primaries work or just trolling
i ’d be very surprised if he does step down though he ’s been in the game so long politicians do n’t just step away when they ’re at the peak of their career
there ’s nothing to suggest that the biden administration has been in general incompetent but bearing in mind things like simply rewarding someone who is a proven sexual predator fraud and serial liar on a level other politicians can only gawp at and the special circumstances in the us of supreme court nominations or some investment in the importance of a world order that is more that expansive dictatorships the naive absurdity of your response comment is unanswerable indeed
then maybe biden should allow a candidate who people who actually vote for to step in last night was his chance to prove the skeptics wrong and instead he showed that things are even worse than we thought it does n’t matter whether or not it ’s fair or rational for people to not show up for biden the reality is that they are n’t going to and we need to start taking that reality seriously
no polls have been conducted since the debate
lol at when you are shocked to lose in november not because it 's not funny but here you are handing trump the presidency on a silver platter great work
oh but he 'll stop before his guys get to them i mean look they barely even tried to kill mike pence and he was a loser anyway s
if he was gon na actually do that he could have done it the first time
yeah if he makes it back into the wight house it 's going to be bad word
yes but your standard dish of syphilis typically does n’t typically quote hitler for political gain
but they ’d lose their jobs so ca n’t have that ignoring the fact that they ’re losing their jobs no matter what
it 's the minimally motivated voters who decide elections i guess this is why political campaigns do n't court trade unions politically active community and religious leaders and high turnout voting blocs because motivated voters do n't decide elections i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say this was some bad word choice
the fuck is a hardcore dem they 're a center right party most of the left hate them slightly less than they do republicans and those that are complacent in calling themselves dems are generally so milquetoast that the word ' hardcore ' might even have them clutching their pearls
typically that ’s true but look at the delta of actual election results to polling over the past couple of years there are many more motivated anti trump voters than the discourse seems to acknowledge in fact the coalition of motivated anti trump has grown quite a bit the coalition of motivated pro trump has shrunk that ’s an evidence based statement not conjecture
talking to people outside the democratic bubble says otherwise most people in the country are n’t partisans and they have a poor view of the economy increasing gdp rising standard of living and frankly do n’t know much about biden ’s accomplishments so far modern presidential elections are decided on the edges by “ sometimes ” voters and also by driving turnout apathy kills democrats up and down the ballot these people are n't tuning into a debate though either
shall we give it a week until this media cycle plays out or how about wait for the next media cycle when trump gets sentenced in two weeks yes my mind is open to possible interventions no it ’s not time to rush into the operating room tonight for an amputation
so what do you want to happen the dnc draft someone to run nobody stepped up that was a serious challenge to either hillary clinton or joe biden both of those candidates won their primaries by significant margin of democratic party voters
here 's a fact the ones saying he is too old i am voting for trump were always going to vote for trump
are you saying you wo n't if so please explain the logic
if were gon na throw around phrases like that many more will turn away from trump after the lies
i mean there is a fine line between being hopeful and being naive we still have over 4 months until the election and things can get better do n't get me wrong they can get a hell of alot worse too and let 's be real america 's attention span is a joke this debate will be memory holed in a week or two anyway
there are other moderates voting for biden too as you can observe
homie deflection is the only thing you can do if you want to defend his performance last night biden is cognitively unfit i voted for him but i wo n't again unless they change candidates cope and seethe all you want lots of people feel the same way
yeah we ’ll be the ones “ finding out ” when y all hand the country to a dictator because you insist on running a mummified corpse
this capable administration is cool with a guy with dementia running a country those are the guys you are selling to people right now
yes i was considering it but holy crap that was bad
listen jack you can only get 50 billion dollars in weapons this year not 50 5 billion
huh til that 's not necessarily related as it 's implied by the guy above me though
he ’s capable of restraint when he knows it is to his advantage last night though lying his ass off he mostly laid low and allowed biden to sabotage himself everything he could possibly gain from debating biden was already achieved yesterday
on top of which he says he reps the bronx but is primarily a westchester candidate
no those were scandals brought up by oppo research he was gerrymandered and spent out of office by conservative dems and aipac
the fire alarm stunt was game you do n't seem to have it
just look at how much flak sanders got for suggesting that obama has someone run against him in 2012 the democratic party ensures there 's little competition when they want which is why they were also pissed at sanders for not dropping out so hillary could get an early coronation in 2016
yeah they just air their dirty laundry out there all the time it 's always clear who has no idea how politics actually works
i dislike trump but he did better than biden most people think this
can we stop saying vote for s t let ’s look at the accomplishments the things that have gotten done if we keep pounding the old dementia grandpa narrative it does n’t do much in the dems favor heard over over people will get that stuck in their brains hammer on integrity morals concern for citizens the positive attributes they are there
the question is n't who is the morally better option the question is is biden politically capable of defeating trump in 2024 and is there another option that would make actually winning more likely those are two distinct questions one is an ethical question the other is a question of practical political considerations yes trump is a fascist and must be defeated that 's exactly why biden should step aside because contrary to the claim he is the likeliest candidate to win it is now manifestly true that he is a dangerous choice as he 's likely to lose
people have been saying trump will do that for a decade i ’m not convinced it will work a third time on the fence sitters you need to win
i was just answering the question i 'm voting for biden if he is the nominee he likely wo n't win with that disastrous performance though
there s also that he from california which is solidly blue and literally the worst place on earth according to right wing media whitmer is a popular governor that s live in a swing state near other swing states she also good at messaging especially on abortion also i believe a woman running would motivate more women voters to go out and vote especially due to abortion
whitmer garentees at least one swing state which is important newsom on the other hand is absurd and only something you hear abiut on reddit
he 'd be great but then we 'd need a new governor who wo n't screw us up or go to jail or both
yeah i know about that comparison i do n't necessarily think it 's intentional about anything except economic issues i do agree that when it comes to capitalism the establishment dems absolutely want to hold it up i do think the dems genuinely have different goals than republicans though i do n't think they are pretending to disagree while behind closed doors working together to keep people down i think they actually do disagree about important things and the republicans are about 1000 times worse not voting and letting republicans win is not going to help in any way if what you are saying is true the dems will never go left even if you punish them so voting for them over the republicans is still best and also not mutually exclusive from other forms of political activism also speaking of i 'm sure you are taking effective action outside of voting right or do you mostly just make memes about how the election is pointless online
as opposed to sitting back and letting the further right to an insane degree republican party do whatever the fuck they want to the 99 9 % of us yes absolutely you all act like if we do n't vote then nothing is going to change and we 'll get a better shot next time with a left wing dem party realistically republicans get into office again and push us even further to the right if you think something else will happen let me know what but your plan is literally just a version of my plan without the benefit of damage mitigation i get that the dems are capitalist and are not what the country really needs for true improvement but the idea that they are secretly plotting with the republicans to keep everyone down is ridiculous conspiracy brain shit the only sense in which that 's true is that both parties are capitalist and even on that point there are individuals within the party that are n't really capitalist both sides are bad is not mutually exclusive from one side is 1000x worse saying that it 's worth republicans winning is a privileged af take that comes from your life personally not being affected by republican policies but millions of people are for example are you telling women that their reproductive rights are n't as important as threatening the dems
even if he steps aside and tells you to vote for his replacement cool
first he has n't been nominated yet second there can still be an open convention third nobody was running against him because he promised us he is up to the task he broke that promise last night
there is n't anyone at the moment who can beat trump except biden all this boohooing will get trump elected if biden is still our nominee at election time are you voting for him
maybe syphilis makes you talk like that did n't hitler have it and the dude who killed hitler i think also had it
i never said they do n't matter but these are two significantly known figures for the most part allegiances are already made with those major voting blocs they 're not the ones being fought for as the election draws closer
right the “ party decides ” attitude is getting old there were elections these are who the collective voters in the parties chose amongst like 20 people each time people complain it was rigged against bernie in 2020 when everyone else dropped out and endorsed biden that ’s admitting that your preferred candidate was n’t popular with a majority of the party if narrowing it down to a 1v1 race is “ unfair ” reality is that the policies and messaging of clinton and biden are clearly working for more members of the party this ire should go to the preferred candidate bernie whoever to work on their pitch deck and their messaging to the party got ta win the prelim before you win the big game
the only viable option is convincing biden to step aside and nominate someone at an open convention they will not call for a different candidate publicly it just wo nt happen but there are absolutely back door arguments being made trying to convince him to step aside
saw someone just earlier say “ 4 hours ago i would n’t have voted for that felon if you held a gun to my head but now i ’m voting for trump ” the obvious bullshit is overwhelming
i 'm not worried about anyone switching to trump i 'm worried about apathy and people staying home
no one is saying that it ’s the people who are n’t as politically engaged and do n’t participate in this subreddit who will simply not vote handing trump the w
i likely will not i live in a state that leans very sharply towards one candidate it is n't worth my time edit on top of having two geriatrics running the electoral college makes it all even more of a joke
yeah but still democrats consistently have problems motivating their base and running biden almost guarantees a deflated turnout the other side may be smaller but it will be significantly more energetic
one can hope but trumps responses were appalling biden could have had a clear lead right now he bottled it and badly a whole bunch of people just confirmed what they had been seeing on social media that biden is rapidly deteriorating and is n’t fit for office that ’s not a small blunder
maybe i 'm just used to trolls shills and fox news saying cognitively unfit everyday for the last 4 years and then seeing him speak and reality does n't fit the narrative homie you act like he 's a drooling zombie we all have eyes and ears cope and seethe about your boring talking points lots of people feel the same way
r whatbidenhasdone lists the things that biden 's presidency has done for the us if 90 minutes changed your mind then maybe you should look at what 3 5 years did here 's an ask spend 30 minutes 1 3rd the time you spent watching the debate if you watched the whole thing if you still feel the way you do fine bear in mind that a vote for president is a vote for the whole executive branch and there are a lot of amazing people tirelessly working to fix our country 's issues and maintain the things that make it good biden is easily in the top 20 presidents of all time maybe even top 10
yes i was considering it uh huh
his district was different the first time he ran ny dems gave him a big swath of westchester in the redistricting
yeah the people that think everything is a conspiracy are usually the people who do n’t actually know how party politics work
what points did he make that you liked
yes they are there in spades people just looking for the quick sound bites one has ethics morals integrity honesty compassion experience depth and actual accomplishments the other none of the above
he literally ca n’t now in some states they ’ve left it too late and the dnc are shite
people have been saying trump will do that for a decade i ’m not convinced it will work a third time on the fence sitters you need to win he has n't had the chance for half of that time also trump himself is practically telling eveyone the same thing
biden can not beat trump it ’s not boohooing it ’s reality he barely scraped by in 2020 with a number of advantages he does n’t have now and has picked up several massive new liabilities he has had consistently abysmal approval ratings our choices are a certain loss with biden or the possibility of a win with someone else
that actually makes a lot of sense
well that 's why i gave you the benefit of the doubt i would think it likely better to say motivating voters is what decides elections and to do that you need that base to get out and motivate those unmotivated voters maybe a small distinction but an important one i think
the way people talk about the dnc it seems as if they are under the delusion that the us has a parliamentary system of government where parties maintain some sort of “ party discipline ” whether this is due to people not paying attention in civics class or the presence of foreign agents pushing disinformation is up to the conspiracy theorists to figure out
yeah but there was nt a real dem primary there never is in an incumbency
yeah that person was always voting for the felon
so it 's worth everyone else 's time just not yours alrighty
that ’s lovely and it was a great few years but that should n’t make it okay for someone with any cognitive issues to continue to be in the most important position in the world for people that truly think he has declined so far the people around him look really bad in their eyes as they are enabling him let ’s put this another way joe other than his age has no physical disabilities would it still be okay for him to be driving everyday do you think his reflexes and decision making is still fast enough for that and if not then what makes him still fit for office where the decisions are needed quick and at all hours of the day night
if he drops out then biden pledged voters at the convention will be free to choose whoever they want that 's how an open convention works as for getting a new name on state ballots that 's probably gon na involve some legal wrangling and the sooner biden steps aside the easier that will be but legally speaking biden is not the nominee of the democratic party for president yet and neither is trump the nominee of the republican party even though both are probably foregone conclusions realistically
who can win show me their polling
yeah the us is relatively unique in how much say we have over candidate nominations and how much the individual matters lol i feel like you get it and i do n’t need to say it to you but for anyone else reading most other systems the party truly decides you ’re voting just for the party you want based on platform and they fill the individuals our parties are basically the end result in parliamentary systems it ’s why bernie sanders aoc biden and manchin can all be in the same tent they ’re coalition by nature as for people not getting it it feels like sanders got a lot of people into politics who were n’t interested before good thing but that also means they did n’t know the ins and outs of the process and felt like there was no way he was losing because he had big crowds no way the workaday average dem in a primary state maybe wanted the tried and true candidate it must just be rigged lol
not this time but there was in 2020 and that ’s what i was referring to with my example there could ’ve been though lbj effectively got forced out by a strong enough challenge and the party had more control back then
okay here 's the thing we going to quibble with hypotheticals or with reality reality biden is the candidate we do n't have another option choosing another option now would more than likely fail as republicans will latch onto a switch hard so biden is the guy if he gets 25th'd out then that 's fair hypothetical biden does drop out who replaces him who has enough charisma know how experience and funding to make a viable run for the presidency i hear gavin newsom thrown around a lot gavin newsom is fine he 's not exactly what i 'd call a runaway popular politician maybe gretchen whitmer then listen i know it fucking sucks but she 's a woman if she wants to run she has to start at least a year in advance for the country to get over its sexist views who else bernie he 's too old now too pete buttigieg he 's wildly unpopular because he comes across as a condescending ass i think he has a chance in the future maybe 3 4 terms from now he 's also gay and see my comment on whitmer the problem is people love to get caught up in what might have been and should haves but we do n't live in the past we live in the present presently our options are 1 biden an old man who clearly is running low on steam 2 trump another old man who 's a rambling egotistical nightmare human being 3 do n't vote that 's basically leaving things entirely up to everyone else we do n't have the luxury of living in the missed opportunities and branching choices we have to vote for the future of democracy and we have to push again after this election for fucking change so that both parties stop running the lesser of two evils elections and i 'm not saying biden is evil he 's just old that 's really it
if he drops out then biden pledged voters at the convention will be free to choose whoever they want that 's how an open convention works do you trust them to actually agree on one person let alone choose someone that will be better it 'd take a month of polling to suss out who of several possibilities would engage potential voters the most it would some lengthy war gaming to see who might build the national presence and the momentum necessary it 's not happening
the dems may not be able to stand anyone in some states that gifts the electoral college to trump it ’s too late
have you looked at biden ’s polling
yeah that s not really historically accurate there was nt a big coordinated effort by the party to get lbj not to run he mostly made that decision himself and it was because he did n’t think he could win and his failing health he never lost a single primary but he did nt think he could win a general election biden should do something similar he should have dome something similar a year ago this is on him any way you slice it
yeah has anyone seen the fuckery that ’s gone on in the ohio state legislature over the dnc missing a single deadline which has been granted exceptions in the past i ’m not convinced they ’d be able to replace a candidate in time if certain state legislatures said no and it ’d have to go up through the courts let alone if it ’d be possible at all
yes but people know joe none of this matters unless joe drops out as of now he is n't so get behind our nominee and make sure we have another wave to carry him over
he made that decision because challengers overperformed in primaries i ’m an lbj fan and a political science teacher and even i would n’t act like he just made that choice lol mccarthy almost beat him in nh which is terrible for a sitting president and it opened the door to bobby kennedy running too that was the death knell
exactly it ’s too late now was it smart no but what ’s left as an option now give up many states and run no dem presidential candidate at all
how was this not a thing already

scotus will probably declare unconstitutional
amazing this did nt exist before
msds sheets that ’s what we wanted to see when i was in the trade had all info
this is full of proactive and high involvement practices previously it was all passive signage for hazmat datasheets available on request it 's really easy in us society where the bulk of services are passive to be contented with this
i ’m waiting for them to announce joe is stepping down
another win for the people thanks to the biden administration this could save a lot of lives and prevent long term illness for first responders
i thought they already rigged everything the government does to be automatically unconstitutional until proven otherwise with the latest rulings it ’s less work and more back end bribes for them
where the fuck was this biden last night not even in the content of his answers just his voice if he was projecting his voice the way he did in nc i think even with most of the same answers he 'd of been judged teh winner of the debate or it 'd of been seen as a wash
he was pissed off i wish he had that same energy last night still would take a potted plant over trump
this is what biden needs to do if he wants to stay in the race he has to own the bad performance and show that he still has the energy to do the job and he needs to do it now two to three weeks are all he has to prove his case before talk of getting him to drop out becomes too loud for him to ignore i bet we will see a lot of him in the next week or two maybe an interview or two with friendly sources or a late night show though they are not filming this week thanks to the holiday of course biden does not exist in a vacuum trump only won the debate because his opponent shit the bed the man spewed nothing but bile and lies last night he just did it confidently with a strong voice his next couple of weeks do n't look too hot though monday the supreme court will hand down their ruling on his crazy immunity claims i ca n't see that going his way outside maybe a ' presidential act ' immunity if the delay to the last possible day is n't alito slow walking a dissent and the court was going to give him immunity they would n't have delayed this far the week after next trump gets sentenced for his current conviction given his violation of the gag order and the general sentences for those crimes it is likely he will get jail time week after that he 's got the convention he needs to show off to those undecided and double haters to woo their vote his string of vitriol and lies is n't going to do that biden looks a lot better today at the rally he held and if he can keep that up while the party elders circle the wagons which they are doing for the moment he can turn this around an assist from trump 's upcoming issues will help but it can only be an assist if biden still looks like he did last night come the republican convention it does n't matter if trump is behind bars awaiting an insurrection trial in the fall that talk of replacing him will only get louder
i did n't need a debate to tell me biden is old i knew it when i voted for him in 2020 i know it when i vote for him again 2024 the amouny of doom gloom is getting ridiculous biden 's opponent is 34 time convicted felon legally defined rapist disaster former president whitmer newsome any other potential hail mary candidate will be destroyed at first i fell for the same disappointed feeling until i noticed conservative media is pushing this replace biden bull shit anything pushed by them is the opposite of what needs to happen
being hoarse and having a stutter did n’t help biden but he was n’t worthless as people are making him seem people are focusing on the golf conversation that happened for a whole minute and pretending that was the entire 90 minute debate which is pretty depressing let ’s focus instead on the fact that trump did n’t mention a single thing he would do or has done let ’s focus on the fact trump made personal attacks the entire debate let ’s focus on the fact that trump just kept repeating that immigrants are bad the entire debate let ’s focus on biden talking numbers let ’s focus on biden talking the plans he ’s made and what he ’s going to do let ’s focus on biden discussing his actual thoughts on how to improve each topic on hand or let ’s ignore 87 minutes of the debate because golf
“ but i tell the truth ” finish the quote
biden was the one goading trump to debate that was fucking stupid
how do you debate someone who constantly spews lies
my god where was this man last night it ’s night and day if he had only brought half of that energy this would be a done deal
he 's got a lot of work to do to dig out of the hole he created with last night 's performance
just watched this performance and he sounds downright good do nt know what the hell happened last night but we need this biden every time he speaks
biden at 81 with the right staff in place is still a better alternative than a convicted felon and his merry band of liars and stooges but if i were the dems i 'd go newsom bernie ticket
people can ignore the stutters we 're used to it by now but he looked like a lost old man who did n't know where he was most of that debate and could barely finish a coherent thought its joever
i like that admitting his wrongs moving on if trump underperformed he ’d claim some made up bullshit if there ’s one silver lining from yesterdays flop it ’s that dems will show urgency and not pull any punches to defeat that turd of a man that is donald trump
so he ’s admitting he has declined
everyone calling for biden to step aside may as well be a 5th column we are in the zero hour to replace him now with a handful of months left would be suicide the only recourse is to circle the wagons the gop does it all the time and it works dems in disarray meme is only a thing if they let it circle the wagons and rally behind 1 united candidate and send trump and his ilk back to the shadowrealm
his performance was n't even close to anything from four years ago this is with decades of experience debating
he was never a good debater the only reason he won the last election is because his name was n’t donald trump people hate trump so much they put an arrogant senile 80 year old they do n’t like into office instead
he does n't know it but he just admitted that he 's in decline dumbest thing he could have said right now
good thing being able to think on your feet and process large amounts of info in real time is n’t an essential part of the job s
fuck i hate trump but biden shit the bed last night ca n't we have someone who is n't 100 years old and actually is likeable
i ’m scared man this is the one thing that nearly every news outlet not just fox has hounded biden for and we all just watched him act just like what they ’ve portrayed him as we ’re in trouble unless dems can get their messaging crystal clear on this acknowledging these poor showings loudly and publicly while highlighting differences with trump is a good start imo
then for fucks sake do nt do it again
i think biden should treat the next debate as a rally do n't get sucked into trump 's nonsense do call him out for his lies but focus on forward messaging of the topic at hand
this level of humility must seem so foreign and so weak to trump and actually tens of millions of christians that support him
it 's like my grandpa before we had to take the keys away grandpa would n't stop driving himself his grandkids had to tell him it was time we need newsom to take the wheel now if we are still gon na win
love ya joe but it is time to hang it up last night was sad
all of what he said is true but it 's obvious from last night 's debate that his brain is n't functioning at the level it needs to function at to be president
yeah that ’s one way of saying it
we did n't need him to debate anything all he had to do was stand there and look alive trump predictably was n't answering questions he did n't have to either
he did n’t debate that well in the past either
where was he standing exactly in relation to the cameras he seemed like he was staring off at nothing to the left with his mouth slightly open dumbfounded at life itself where were his coaches i kept screaming for him to smile more because it made him look so much more present even for a few seconds i was neutral on him looking down at his notes though it made him look asleep trump seemed like he was looking into the camera more hatefully but present
biden candidacy trump victory if biden wo n't willingly step down dem 's need to seriously go the 25th amendment route it 's literally the only possible option look we can deny it all we want we can downvote all we want but let 's make one thing perfectly clear after last night biden is not beating trump if biden 's name is the name representing the democrats on nov 4 trump wins it 's that simple for the sake of democracy and the future of our country all legal available means must be used to stop biden if he chooses to not willingly step down for the sake of our country the 25th amendment can not and should not be ruled out and the threat of the 25th amendment should be made very clear to biden by the people who are closest to him
also was n't a debate in even the remotest sense of the word
its too late the energy in biden 's speech today is what was needed yesterday when 48 millon people watched only a few thousand people will see this today he 's done
i volunteered for joe making calls on his behalf in 2020 i donated to his campaign i believed in him and trusted him when he told us to watch him i believed him when he said he was up to the task of running this year he has betrayed my trust and i feel sick the only path forward if he cares about his country at all is to step aside
good he should drop out the race then he ’s too damn old
24 hours later and everyone 's back to making excuses for him can we stop and instead focus our collective efforts to convince him to step aside so we might actually have a chance at not losing our country to trump please
yeah biden he ’s our man if he ca n’t do it orange man bad
it 's one thing to stand on stage with a prewritten speech a telepromter a crowd that is patient and on his side its another to speak on your feet against a crazy man on the other side without any of the aforementioned advantages
i honestly think he took some cold medicine as he had a cold and it made his brain foggy i know it does that to me believe it or not
i personally think he tried to hard to remember the “ talking points ” or “ lines ” the campaign prepped him for all week which led to him not only fumbling on his words but causing his speech impediment to come out in that stuttering mess but the strength of his voice was not there last night as it was today i linked it to lack of water last night as why did n’t the candidates have water next to them to drink
flubbing on stage does n't just happen to old people i 'm writing this off as one bad evening i 've had enough with sackcloth and ashes and i 'm not even close to contemplating switching out biden that 's guaranteed to be a clusterfuck it 's one bad debate dust yourselves off and get back in the ring
my only thought is sickness the late hour my father is in late 60 ’s and goes to bed at like 8 00 biden ’s is not gon na be the sharpest tack at 10 00 certainly not being sick
sounded like the cold plus losing his voice practicing debating
it ’s day and night almost as if he ’s experiencing cognitive decline as the day turns into evening
biden had a teleprompter and a prewritten speech today so what you saw today is an illusion a façade to conceal the truth about joe biden last night the world saw the real joe biden
the man is clearly past his bbd you ’re gon na get a few moments every now and then but he ’s 81 and it ’s not gon na get any better my father passed away a year and half ago same age and i can assure he was not the same man who raised me tough to say and admit but it 's life
he should be replaced with someone competent newsom whitmer
show that he still has the energy to do the job and he needs to do it now governing and campaigning are two completely different jobs i have no doubt biden can do the former not sure if he can do the latter i 'm not sure he can keep this up for 5 months
he wo n't get jail time as it 's a big can of worms because of things like his secret service detail he 'll get house arrest at most with that worse case scenario for him is if he 's not allowed to do it at mar a largo and has to do it in say ny
he did own it said he ’s not as good at debating as he once was i think it ’s actually a good move or the best under the circumstances people ca n’t hate an old guy with a stutter and a lot of republican politics relies on hatred and anger i wonder if the democrats have stumbled on magas achilles heel
biden has had 4 years plus another 4 lesser ones as vp to be labelled as everything under the sun by the right wing conspirosphere and come out clean any other candidate the dems try to run now would have 4 months that 's not going to happen and even if it did the dem voting bloc is too puritanical and even a single offshoot could cause the vote to stagger let 's say newsome accidentally hit his dog opening a car door one day now he 's an animal abuser and the admin does n't have enough time to do damage control for 60 % of the potential vote to hear it
agree generally but why would newsome get destroyed
beating trump on facts and figures gathers no votes
biden could ’ve debated a wall last night and he would ’ve lost it
not by acting like a dementia suffering old man that ’s for sure
somebody wrote him a speech and he read it he can still read so hopefully that will keep him in the race
when the vp 's main purpose is to be the emergency back up president why would we want someone in their 80s for that job
replacing biden with someone even older anywhere on the ticket is insane newsom also has immense baggage just from being from california if we replace biden it basically has to be with a mid western governor
no no no people need to stop with bernie also newsome wo n’t do it as even he knows it ’s a death knell to his future the odds are he will lose
newsom holy shit that ’s a terrible idea have you seen his track record
the dems will never pick bernie because he actually represents the people
bernie is a loser why the hell would you want him on the ticket
how many times does bernie have to lose before we all move on i ’d take some combination of harris newsom whitmer buttigieg moore keep your eyes on moore
doctor here he looks like he ’s recovering from a very recent stroke biden has had two cerebral aneurysms in the past so we know he ’s prone to vascular disease such as strokes and you can clearly see his stepwise decline in cognitive performance over the years vascular dementia at play here his “ stuttering ” looks more like the dysarthria and word finding difficulties you see with stroke survivors and he certainly fits the bill of one i ’m nearly certain he lied about having childhood stutters to hide his residual stroke symptoms either he ’s now lost his ability to compensate for an old “ stutter ” or more likely it ’s due to new brain damage
he most likely never even stuttered he claimed he had a stutter when he was younger to gain sympathy kind of like how his son died in iraq his wife was killed by a drunk driver his uncle was eaten by cannibals and how he was arrested for protesting segregation go watch video of him from his time as vp no stutter to be seen
yeah that 's literally the headline now go pull up some videos of donald trump from the 90s and compare them to the way he talks today and tell me his brain is still all there
it 's not too late i think who ever replaced biden would be 5 in polling almost right away someone has to convince biden though
or an alternative pressure the democratic establishment to replace biden since he is n’t able to run the country let alone defeat trump
is that what trump does process large amounts of info in real time while being clever and quick witted
when my son pisses the bed hiding his trousers does not unpiss the bed the only chance dems have is if he drops out
you said that thing from the internet you guys it 's that thing from the internet
as if we need another liberal establishment democrat like clinton who will change nothing whitmer is the better choice
nobody is behind newsom he ’s running a failed state and nobody outside of ca likes ca besides the beautiful women and landscapes
his might not be trump 's definitely is n't either pick the lesser of two evils by which i mean the one who does n't literally say he will be a dictator and does n't literally brag about how he 's going to be president for the next 20 years
putting so much weight on a president 's performance in a debate and not on a president 's 4 year performance in office is a poor way to look at it biden is surrounded by advisors with the credentials to run this country advisors that he genuinely trusts and listens to trump has surrounded himself with yes men so he can have control to tank the economy like he did last time
sure that all helps but it does n't explain the simple ability to just project his voice and actually clear his throat he 's showing today he would of still had a meh debate if he was n't so raspy but it would n't be anywhere near the doom levels if he was able to at least sound like he does today
they decided no notes why in the fuck did they go with no notes or you know water
the crazy person did nt interrupt and make it hard to talk though trump knew what was happening and let biden spin his wheels out
however speaking on your feet against crazy men e g other world leaders seems like a thing the leader of the free world should be capable of doing
plus a cheering crowd boosts the energy up and empty auditorium with a mad man and an enabler not so much seems like biden should have gone for crowds and then trump would have made more self goals trying to rile them up
but was n't the venue and channel to his advantage it was on cnn not like fox
how does one deal with kim jung un putin xi or even raisi if they ca n't handle trump
i honestly think he 's just an old fart
they did have water it was part of debate rules
the people thinking biden should step down now are either delusional or they 're paid shills it 's too late and it 's less about biden than it is to keep trump out of the office
biden does this regularly anyone saying different is gaslighting
good thing major world crises only happen during normal business hours
and we saw the real trump total bullshit
harris has a problem of being in many polls even more unpopular than biden or trump i do n't quite know why she 's been pretty under the radar for the last few years so its weird voters have such strong feelings on her but she is
so basically 4 more years of trump do you not realize how bad it would be to change from a known product to two people only a faction of the country has heard about are you aware of the advantages of being the incumbent of having a record that can actually be applied to the entire nation that has a history of foreign policy and diplomatic actions in the last 4 years worth talking about biden is the name brand the one people who barely even follow the news know about newsom is nobody to these people and whitmer is even less they 'll have no chance against trump because they have no public profile
2028 hell yeah it just would n’t work even if they made the switch a month ago an election is like a large cargo ship you ca n’t change course on a dime biden is the best option on everything he ’s incredible his only real knock is being old and having a stutter everything else he ’s our best option by far
whitmer is unknown newsome is known as mr california high taxes
there are hard proven political science models on how the incumbent advantage is a big deal watcha got to counter that feelings
next time they can take it
this is the move right here present a candidate so pathetic that it makes republicans look like jerks for bullying someone ’s doddering grandpa it ’s the perfect play
even in california he 's got a lot of detractors plus california 's failed policies would give the right wing blogosphere ample rage ' n ' fear fuel he 's not as clever as his fans think he is he needs a lot of work to be ready for the big leagues
i 'm not really concerned with how good of a debater he is he is n't lying to my face
i think he 's doing a great job as president if he really had dementia he would not be able to perform his duties
watch him in interviews with the press where they are all screaming random questions at him he does not sound anything like last night and those always lack teleprompters or pre written speeches i mean he still has his speech impediment but that is normal
whitmer i like her in michigan but i thought she could have been a very credible vp candidate in 2020 i think that a good co promise would be replacing harris with a good vp candidate and i 'd look to whitmer for that i know that 's easier said then done
he 's spending the weekend with gov phil murphy of nj
anyone who wo n’t vote for californian is n’t voting democrat anyways
evers whitmer shapiro or pritzker would be the options in that case pritzker is illinois so not a swing state i also think chicago hosting the dnc which is already expected to have protests might be a tough sell you 're gambling on brandon johnson not screwing that up also he has n't finished his first term shapiro is also on his first term i do n't really like either of these two as they are pretty green for an emergency fill in selection whitmer feels like the safest pick she probably has the best name recognition of the 3 and is young evers is the oldest at 72 that could actually be an asset though i could easily see large sections of the dem base not want a 2028 incumbent so evers would just come out and say he wo n't seek re election in a way i do n't think the younger two would want my thinking here is newsom and his allies want biden to run so he can prep for 2028 2032 he 'd be 6 years out of office that 's a long time in the political world he would want biden to stay in rather than potentially facing an incumbent whitmer in 2028 also the progressive wing was mad about 2016 there was no primary this year potentially taking away a 2028 primary from them for a moderate dem could be a tough selling point instead basically admitting we know the primaries did n't pick our candidate but we 'll let you pick the next one might be something that could allow a coalescing around a biden alternative
just think of all the post offices he could rename given the power of the presidency
what a bad ass handle for a doctor god bless you dr gasmask g
joe either lied about his stutter or has worked hard to control and overcome it it 's one of those for sure and i guess you think it was a lie so instead root for the ignorant infantile bully who spews 18 lies every time he opens his mouth
trump ’s brain has been mush for decades he fried it with drugs long before the effects of old age even kicked in he ’s just very loud and confident in the insane things he says it ’s so frustrating that this is seen as competence by anybody
i never said it was but okay but not all cognitive decline is equivalent last night it was pretty clear one guy was suffering from it way worse than the other
honestly this is the best summary of the situation i 've seen please can downvote they can write pages and pages of rebuttal but at the end of it all this phrase is literally what it comes down to and it ca n't be denied anymore
he ai n’t finished but he ’s fighting an uphill battle now which is insane when your opponent is an insurrectionist rapist convicted felon
absolutely not he ’s a horrific liar
ca is the most economically important state in the entire country lol it is not a failed state
he ’s running a failed state you mean in the way that it contributes 1 8th of our federal government 's tax revenue while being the 2nd least reliant on outside funding how it 's the 7th happiest state in the us or what which part is a failed state
yeah run a white man over the black vp that will help with turnout
trump joked he 'd be a dictator only on day one with the executive orders he 'd plan on signing to roll back some of biden 's executive orders and i have no clue about the 20 year thing i 've never heard trump say that and if he did i 'd bet dollars to donuts it was a joke
he needs to persuade swing voters that he is up to the task of being president for 4 more years they came into this debate fearful that he is too old and weak to do so they walked out of the debate with their fears confirmed it 's not about just one debate
yeah this guy is so dramatic with his i feel sick comment what a wimp as if he just learned that biden is an old man lol i mean he 's old right now and seemingly keeping the country together i do n't understand the news flash epiphany people are having
i would add that he also should have had the self awareness to not have a deer in the headlights expression with his mouth open when it was n't his turn
the doom yesterday was nt the projection or raspiness of his voice the doom was when he stumbled over words forgot what he was saying and lost his train of thought president biden how would you protect abortion rights well asdfdsasfas mmmm nknjkhlhkhljk well folks sddsfsdaae beat medicare
it sounded to me like he choked on a sip of water immediately before his mic went on and he could n’t recover for like three more speaking opportunities maybe because he could n’t take a minute to directly attend to the choking without it being a different big deal or um whatever
you did nt grasp the original comment its easy to project your voice when you are reading a teleprompter can you imagine if biden projected his voice at the debate and loudly went durrrrrr we beat medicare uhhhhhh durrrr
you know humans can have off days can make mistakes why the need to focus on biden ’s bad debate trump remains a two time impeached convicted felon trump ’s scotus is continually dismantling decades of precedent project 2025 is looming i ’m not convinced that the average american is getting worked up over this debate the average bot on the other hand
he ’s an 81 year old man he belongs in an assisted living facility or at the very least living out his final days in peace at home around family he should not be on a debate stage in the first place what they are doing to him is elder abuse
that is what biden wanted
biden was trying to read off a sheet on multiple occasions though
you do n't really debate world leaders as president though sure they speak one on one and whatnot but the important shit happens when my people get with your people it 's more of a decider role
we have an example of that the leadup to the 2022 invasion of ukraine was a masterstroke of foreign policy in 4 presidents i 've never seen putin so completely outmaneuvered
that 's not how a good chunk of the base sees it particularly younger folks these they selecting biden as a way to suppress left voices biden at best is center arguably leaning center right
not really most of the moments you see on fox news are out of context or straight up fabrications
can you provide another example since you believe it 's so frequent
trump was lucid spoke clearly and had a grasp of the issues joe was a demented old man who should be enjoying the rest of his life in a retirement home
whenever she pops up it ’s saying some weird shit that gets memed for the wrong reason and people have n’t forgotten the track record that made her unpopular in the 2020 primaries she also has n’t been like notable in any other way than those weird comments from time to time while she ’s been vp like she ’s just kinda there
for some reason all those well biden is still way better than trump so vote for him regardless disappeared when we start talking about harris
she did pretty poor in the debates herself and i think it was mostly because of some of her nervous tics laughter for instance puts off the complete opposite image from what you want not her fault but i had the same tic for a long time and have really had to fight it over the years because it always comes off smarmy sardonic that 's what i find off putting at least besides her much more center right politics
biden is the name brand biden 's been doing great work and yet his brand is incredibly weak he 's a deeply unpopular incumbent regardless of the reality of his accomplishments
no one knows it has never been tried before
we will get those 4 more years with this walking corpse as nominee do n’t delude yourself last night was a bad look name brand if the brand is a senile old man who beat medicaid and ca n’t string a sentence together
it should definitely be done now he ’s barely able to string together a sentence or remember where he is there are way better options
whitmer is not unknown she was the victim of right wing trumpism it makes a good narrative she ’s from the midwest michigan is important newsom is witty and handsome and has experience working in one of the largest state governments in the country
political science is n’t an actual science sorry degrees in that field are n’t worth the paper they are printed on only hard sciences are science so fuck those feelings but morally smug individuals do n’t really understand that no one cares presidential elections are popularity contests it will always be that way and no one cares for the opinion of the ugly girl or her 3 ugly friends that back her no matter what
they can take it now and he can be put out to pasture in a nice community with juice boxes and nap time
i would n’t recommend the strategy but there might be an angle here if conservatives ca n’t hate or be scared they kinda lose their main motivation
plus his ex wife is sleeping with trump 's kid imagine the vile horse shit temu rita repulsa would air out
funniest thing i have heard all year lmao it ’s pretty easy to find where both of them lie during the debate just by looking at any fact check of it
please stop with the bernie bullshit
provided democracy survives until 2028 whitmer is outstanding nominee on paper what she has done in michigan is great pair her with a solid vp choice and she could do very well
wtf throwing in brandon johnson prizkter coasted getting reelected to his second term
why is this so funny
yeah i 've never heard him stutter his 8 years as vp now that he 's going older i see people blaming his inability to communicate on this mythical stutter rooting for him to remain in the race is essentially the same thing as rooting for trump
but still less of a bullshitter than trump
trump has had his fair share of moments where he could n’t finish a thought but trump knew to bring his a game last night if he actually did n’t lie every time he opened his mouth he ’d have the election in the bag
2016 2 vote blue no matter who then they will cry when we lose
5th biggest economy in the world it 's a fucking state and the economy surpasses nearly every country in the world failed state my ass
do you really judge people based on the color of their skin racist
there 's no world where he lasts 4 more years after seeing him last night
this is why we have vp 's
i have friends that might be arrested or killed for their bodies in the next year or two and even then i do n't really have much to lose compared to most i ca n't imagine how apathetic and maybe even accepting of fascism you must be to be acting like this is normal
because the polling was already extremely close before this with most having trump slightly ahead and now it 's looking like a landslide for trump bidens odds on betting sites went from 130 to 400 american voters are generally very stupid it does n't matter if trump lied about everything he said he looked more confident and healthier than biden that 's gon na be the main takeaway from this debate for those undecided voters
it was after 9 pm and he ’s in his 80 ’s most people that age have been asleep for 4 hours he did n’t have the advantage of nose beers to keep him going
i think him trying to control his raspy voice led to the stumbling over words controlling a stutter is probably really difficult especially when you 're under the weather and old
mate being on a timer and having a stutter is n’t gon na mix well together
well trump was actually worse and he could talk mr trump how will you improve child care trump well we have millions dying from illegals from insane asylums from mexico
the immigrants are raping raping and and in laws “ sir the question was about abortion ”
i do n't have a problem with people losing their train of thought at all i think it 's something that almost everyone experiences you are telling a story and literally lose your train of thought while you are speaking because you are thinking ahead or about something related to what you are saying it was the fact that he lost his train of thought quite a bit and just mumbled something incoherent and on a few occasions he literally just started rambling about unrelated shit and then said something absurd because he also got his words twisted it just really makes you question if there really is a significant mental decline some days he may be fine but others he may be like this or perhaps he is even worse it 's pretty scary trump also garbles words and says crazy word salad bullshit and goes off on random tangents but i do n't feel there is a change there from 2016 that said trump at his best is also scary to sane people
right bad call on that not sure why they wanted that we ’ve seen trump try to drink water
biden is center at best the man is the most progressive president the country has ever had
i say this as someone on the left now is not the fucking time if you want progressives in the white house you have to elect progressives at every level of government leading up to it start with your local governments and or school boards and build that power base over the next 20 years then maybe we 'll get somewhere trying to ram a progressive through when the stakes are this high and we do n't have that foundational base is gon na get us all fucked
i do n’t watch fox news but nice try biden has dementia time to step aside or he ’s going to get rolled by trump no one wanted him the first time but begrudgingly accepted him as a one term compromise now that he ’s going for round 2 people will just stay home
it ’s literally almost every other speech he does there ’s hundreds of examples take your pick
grasp of the issues is generous he answered almost none of the questions
trump lied about literally everything he does n't live in reality and neither do you go back to commenting on porn
trump was all bullshit biden looked old an feeble but trump never answered anything to say that he had a grasp of them issues is bullshit on your part
wow your takeaway from last night was that trump donald john trump had a grasp of the issues that says a lot about your leanings
trump was lucid spoke clearly and had a grasp of the issues lol yeah on 1 2 a definite no on 3
had a grasp of the issues what did you watch he did n’t answer one question
lmao are you fucking serious he 's lucid yet performed as bad as biden did technically he did worse because any lucid person would outright beat biden yesterday but he did n't
biden had obama 's back during a very crucial period of time in this country those voters have not forgotten they also happen to be in ga sc nc il extremely important states to carry
at least i think newsom should be his vp to build his own brand with the public so he can replace biden in 2028 kamala feels like she ’ll just be hillary 2 0 if she runs then
no better option to win ca n’t change candidates this late it ai n’t that easy and he did fine in nc the next day i ’m happy with biden and will enthusiastically vote for him
they 're both wanting 2028 neither want to take on this current shit show
you must think democratic people 's republic of korea is an actual democracy this is why college is important it 's also where you can take political science classes
holy cow i did not know that when he was mayor of sf they were the golden couple that has all of north beach saying goals huh oh well
biden who tends to lean more on exaggerations and embellishments rather than outright lies this is from the article you linked there 's a difference between the two candidates
cool which of the 2 has loaded up the courts with stooges to basically kill democracy in the us none of this both sides are the same business because they are not
at least bernie can still squeak out a coherent sentence
i think chicago is going to be a shitstorm for the dem convention we already know groups are planning on protesting it and it will only be escalated if they are nominating non biden if it goes poorly you risk nominating a guy on the same day you have the illinois national guard called on for the city
yeah i 've never heard him stutter his 8 years as vp you also never saw franklin roosevelt in a wheelchair because public image is carefully managed people who have a stutter but who work hard learn coping techniques and then practice them through an entire lifetime of public speaking maybe have an advantage over the mental image of the real stutterer you are comparing him to ツ edit lol
no doubt trump is a lying lunatic
how does it look when you replace the candidate selected to replace the president with one of them especially when poc support is strained because of gaza
thought the same with trump but he 's still here despite his terrible diet and obesity dude almost died from covid
yeah i 'm not too worried about odds on betting sites this election is gon na be close regardless of how much biden drools on himself still comes down to the non trump candidate and incumbent which is pretty compelling as is imo
hell i am way younger than biden and i was tired
my grandma in her 90s goes to sleep late its just an individual thing
this right here 9 pm is way too late for seniors extremely unthoughtful and insensitive on behalf of the organizers
if you watch older videos of biden you can see him doing tricks like slowing down and pausing frequently to control his stutter in the debate he rushed to get his words out in the limited time period and that triggered his stutter
and have a history of speech impediments biden has been open for decades about the speech impediment he 's had to overcome
his raspy voice has been there for the past year if you ’ve only see him on teleprompter i ’m sure it was a surprise
as someone with a stutter it 's not you mumble more but that 's it the stutter does not get worse you also do nt lose train of thought depending on how bad it is you may have to say a different word to get the point across which sucks btw very much hate it but you still end at the same point you were attempting to make
under the weather controlling a stutter people are really making every excuse for biden the guy is 81 he ’s not there mentally he wo n’t last another 4 years he did his time but now it ’s time to move on
yea that is how skewed to the right the overton window is in this country center is about as far left as american politics goes at all on an absolute scale there are literally no actual left politicians in the u s for context in the uk they have a liberal democrat party that is their centrist party and they are to the left of the democratic party in the u s they have conservative right libdems center labour left we have a far right and a center to center right party and pretend the latter is the left our progressives are centrists in most of europe tl dr so to answer your statement they are right on an absolute scale but you are referring to the relative scale inside the badly skewed overton window of american politics
he do n’t have dementia ya dingus
ok then it should be easy for you to find one
this dude is a trumpster who posts regularly on the loony conservative sub he ’s just baiting
sure but he had a grasp of the issues he wanted to talk about and bullied everyone to play his game questions be damned it 's the classic trump playbook and he played it a lot better than he did in 2020
don jon is a stupid as fuck name
might not be an election in 2028
28 and 32 newsome whitmer 36 and 40 whitmer aoc 44 and 48 aoc if i were to pick the next batch of serious dem presidential nomination contenders these would be my picks
kill democracy by loading courts sorry that killing your children is n’t protected federally also if anything trump getting such a harsh verdict is doing more to kill democracy than anything he did
so can other candidates that are n't in their 80s
maybe have an advantage over the mental image of the real stutterer you are comparing him to ツ the real stutterer i 'm comparing him to is literally him from last night that 's what people are blaming his performance on so he worked hard to manage it his entire career but just decided not to last night edit trump agreeing with you does n't mean you 're right he thinks magnets do n't work under water
what does gaza have anything to do with the color of the president kamala is an indian american but that has no influence on her competency she is low iq and would be a horrendous leader
totally unrelated but your username is marvelous
now that ’s malarkey i ’ll vote for joe over donald even if joe is in a coffin but ffs you ca n’t be a winning presidential candidate if you ca n’t keep it together at 9 pm need to show some modicum of strength
yeah it 's a good thing the president only works until 4 pm every day or these old guys may not be up for the job
there ’s no stutter here this argument is to gas light people into thinking he is n’t mentally impaired due to his old age he ’s a very competent public speaker as a younger man i ’m still voting for him but this argument is just ridiculous that it ’s his stutter that ’s the problem it ’s his age
why would his voice change from a teleprompter
i do n't feel like he lost his train or thought i felt like his stutter was out of control and by the time he got it under control the moments had passed
under the weather controlling his stutter and being 81 it all combined but it ’s not indicative of mental decline just what happens as you age not a concern in terms of ability to handle the presidency as he ’s shown by his actions he ’s not only capable but exemplary the best president in the past 50 years one reverse does n’t change that
been around a lot of 80 year olds seen all kinds of cognitive decline i have and that is n’t what any of it looks like biden is slower for sure but last night was just a bad performance
then he ’s got alzheimer ’s because he ai n’t cognitively fit
you have google look at almost any speech he ’s given problem solved i do n’t need to spoon feed you because you ’re too lazy to do research
more like bellend amirite folks
lol they do n’t get on tv 24 7 either
when he ’s on teleprompter he ’s likely rehearsed or read the statement prior to saying it when off the cuff he stumbles to find his thoughts which makes his voice slower and less projected
it 's hard to put it into words i guess ironic lol it 's a distinct issue where a specific word will be unable to be said so a workaround has to be quickly produced which typically leads to a pause but then a continuation using a different word that was n't the one that caused the stutter no amount of practice or training can prevent it from happening but it is able to help you get back on track a lot easier knowing a lot of words really helps so you can keep chugging along i did n't really see that too often and he was given uninterrupted speaking time so there is no excuse that can be made with the moment being up imo he was mumbling his words which is n't a big deal fellow mumbler myself but there were absolutely times where it became hard to track what was trying to be said best example would be the medicaid one no replacement word was used and the rest of the sentence did n't have any true coherency and when the stutter did happen it was fairly obvious as it followed the general trend of pause workaround speak still better than the slew of lies any day but man do i wish it was n't two old white dudes as our only choices
he absolutely lost his train of thought several times did you watch the same debate that the rest of us did
he does n’t he ’s just old lol just an old guy
what i heard yesterday sounded like a cold or sore throat not something rehearsal could fix that 's just my view tho i guess
personally i feel like your description of dealing with getting stuck on a word was exactly what was happening
i think that the main issue was that they had him memorize a lot of his responses so he was on stage trying to recall memorized responses and trying to get them out before the time was up that ’s why some of his responses were incoherent he ’d start with the correct memorized response and then he ’d start going into another memorized response that was n’t really on topic they basically over prepped for the debate and he needed to be given more freedom to come up with his own responses on the spot his off the cuff responses were good it was his prepared memorized responses that he struggled with
yes while he was stuttering over words he got stuck on he lost his train or thought the beat medicare quote comes to mind
that ’s because the debate structure was really awkward he had to decide whether to refute one of the many lies address the current question or try to get a point across he really wanted in there and all with a really short timer put any tired stutterer with a cold in that situation and you will get a poor presentation
then he should n’t be running he ’s not mentally fit
right even at the rally today which showed him in good form he was still handling a chronic cough he ’s just sick
yeah that is literally exactly what it looked like he train of thought did derail a few times but no more than normal in these kinds of things from what i can tell i did not watch it but i read it i feel like my impressions from reading it are way different than what people got from watching it bad delivery makes everything seem worse than it actuall is
for some of it yeah but there were spots where it was n't the case that 's what i 'm trying to say
unfortunately there were several others instances did you happen to see him being escorted off stage by the first lady it was very sad did you see his after debate presser where he signed off with “ i want to come home with you ” what was that jill should be ashamed to be pushing him into this he was supposed to be a one term president
he has a stutter but his administration has done the right thing at every turn so someone is there doing good things personally i think biden is that guy but even if you do n’t believe that you can agree someone is steering the ship super well vote for what the administration as a whole has done if you like that then vote for biden as that ’s a vote for the administration as a whole
they 're trying to kill us i had cancer treatment took leave with my job protected thanks to the fmla passed by dems in 1993 after bush i vetoed it twice and can now shop for health insurance without being screwed for having a pre existing condition thanks to the aca which the gop is trying to repeal now they want our wallets our air and water they hate us and want to kill us
by overturning chevron the supreme court has declared war on an administrative state that touches everything from net neutrality to climate change
scotus are traitors their decisions will end up killing thousands of the people that they are supposed to protect
i ca nt wait to start eating lead again
i hope sitting out or voting jill stein in 2016 was worth it
keep this in mind in november you 're not just voting for president but potentially 1 or 2 supreme court justices to be appointed by whoever is elected
maybe breaking the administration plaster over the top will eventually force us to have a working congress again nothing about removing chevron deference stops congress from just clarifying a rule in written law for far too long we have relied on the shaky interpretations of courts abortion and admin ghg net neutrality when we have a legislative branch that can literally go into the structure of the laws and fix the studs yes we 'll have to live in the crooked structure until everyone gets fed up enough to make congress work but they have power americans have nearly forgotten they can write a law to make abortion legal they can write a law to make the net neutral you do n't need to rely on interpretation when you can simply write out what you are saying into law if you 're afraid because you do n't think you can get a majority of the country to agree with you about what the law should say yeah that sucks but that 's democracy any victory of your minority over the majority was always going to be temporary
do you think most americans even care
there is an upside in this it may mean that we will stop getting bipolar interpretations of how these agencies should operate instead of every 4 8 years we go from a green epa to a pollute away epa or an fcc that is pro net neutrality to one that would allow cox to throttle anything but coxflix it ’s way dirtier than you ’d think having flexibility is good but the amount there was recently led to agencies spending years trying to undo what the last administration did
right because god forbid we do n't leave it all up to the trump appointed experts that a potential trump administration might consult on these subjects this is a good decision and this sub should really recognize how much it can hinder a potential likely project 2025
the supreme court took law enforcement from the executive branch
only sweeping both houses of congress and reelecting biden will fix this scottish reforms maintain economic growth and inflation control why is that bad for republicans
trump “ vote for me lose what everything vote or worsens
speaking of net neutrality barack obama spent years and many court battles to establish it donald trump wiped it out in an instant joe biden is bringing it back and strangely the internet that used to fill with the issue has been mostly silent
this is probably an outcome that they actually want heavy metal poisoning makes people stupid and violent both of which would advance the agendas of the far right justices on the court
the majority of the country agrees with what democrats think the law should say due to the electoral college every state having 2 senators regardless of population our country is controlled by minority rule that is not democracy
maybe breaking the administration plaster over the top will eventually force us to have a working congress again or maybe the republicans will filibuster every attempt to fix anything like they 've done for 15 years
you are too confident in our elected officials to not be lazy and create unambiguous laws this is exactly why we had the chevron decision to begin with our lawmakers were being too ambiguous because they do nt know anything besides the law they do nt have environmental or food safety knowledge shit is going to hit the fan really bad
all congress seems to do is pass budgets and appointments they have relied on the supreme court to make national legislation based on state laws this is not a recipe for the long term
it simply does n’t matter how clear congress is at this point the supreme court has just ruled that “ otherwise ” does not mean otherwise and gratuities are not “ rewards ” regardless of what law congress writes the court is going to dictate what they want it to be
when the effects start rolling downhill i hope there ’s still time to point at the cause
most americans are too focussed on the many distractions placed before them to even know
sure because this basically killed any ability for agencies to do anything at all
yes it ’s amazing that now the epa and fcc will do either nothing under a dem government or actively sell of the country under a rep one
nope it will mean we are going to have different regions of the country federal circuits interpreting rules and regulations differently then we will get bipolar interpretations based on the court composition this will also impact the types of laws congress choses to pass but given this session has been their least active and that is a trend we will have even greater gridlock
you do realize this literally demolished the ability of every government agency to function right
so take the house and ram it into the senate until they look like shit for it make the fundamental flaw in the democracy clear there is no sturdy future on ignoring it and constantly scrambling with admin to work around the problem all the gains will be under threat in every election that way you need a country based on rule of law not opinion and if the senate flaw is too much to overcome then it 's just fucked
right so maybe breaking the admin state was necessary in order to force congress back into gear budgets and appointments is not a tolerable state for a legislature but people did tolerate it now some things might get bad enough for the public to actually scream at congress until they move
do you know the original chevron case it was literally formed in order to overturn rbj 's own strict interpretation of the epa 's rules and defer to the reagan admin that they get to decide whether they think a new source of emissions counts as a new source or not
it ’ll take decades for the effect to roll downhill when the shit hits the fan the guy in charge will be blamed for it
they 'll just blame biden no matter how long it takes
they clearly do n't anyone that thinks this is a good thing is either ignorant or malicious
how so lack of chevron deference will impact things like agencies charging operation fees the agencies can still function fine
really no government agency was able to function before 1984 congress will have to pick up the slack and that 's about all it 's a good thing it restores checks and balances into a system that was becoming more and more administration heavy and as trump showed this is a very dangerous place to be
without amending the constitution it 'll never happen to do that 2 3 of states would have to agree most red states which make up more than half the total states would have to be willing to give up their electoral advantage that will never happen so yes we 're fucked
accelerationism does n't work when things get worse they just get worse there 's no tipping point where they inevitably get better
yes i ’m very familiar with it believe it or not the world has changed a bit since then
agencies now have no ability to ensure uniform interpretations of statutes and every single regulation is now up to the courts to decide
no it gives far more power to the courts this sc has given itself increasing power over other branches this is far from checks balances
hopefully the courts would be so backlogged by cases that the damage would be limited by the time biden wins
no it gives far more power to the courts no matter what a court wants to do if congress has written a law that explicitly states x you ca n't interpret it as y i strongly stand behind this being mostly a skill check for congress as far as scotus goes it ca n't override explicit language on constitutional amendments for instance
i 'd hope so but given the conservative leanings of many districts this is unironically a sky is falling precedent
they 'll put an injunction on the rule while it winds through the courts so corps get a few lawless years as a treat
except courts do it all the time every law contains some ambiguity because language is imprecise word 's meanings change over time courts can call anything ambiguous use it as an excuse to legislate from the bench the current sc has done it many times further it 's impossible for the hundreds of politicians in congress to quickly agree on regulations especially for new technologies that 's why it is important for the experts at agencies to be able to create regulations
no matter what a court wants to do if congress has written a law that explicitly states x you ca n't interpret it as y in a 6 3 decision the supreme court has struck your law down saying that congress exceeded their constitutional mandate when they passed it the supreme court struck down a part of the civil rights act to toss preclearance saying it needs to be a law when preclearance was already a law or when they said the waive or modify provision in the student loan forgiveness law did n't actually given biden the ability to waive or modify loam amounts the supreme court has ignore statutes redefined words and ignored evidence if it let 's them make the ruling they want they 're making it up as they go secure in the fact that nobody will challenge them nor will they ever be overruled
as horrifying as dobbs is this may actually in the long run be worse
crazy thought but if a political party is working to make sure that a person 's vote is not counted maybe that political party should n't be allowed in election ballots
when a member of georgia ’s fulton county board of registration and elections refused to join her colleagues as they certified two primaries this year she claimed she had been denied her right to examine a long list of election records for signs of fraud or other issues now the board member julie adams an avowed believer in the from former president is suing the board hoping a judge will affirm that right and potentially empower others in similar positions elsewhere to hold up the outcome of elections to voting rights activists election law specialists and democrats such actions represent an ominous sign that could presage a chaotic aftermath to the they are particularly worried about the threat of especially if certification proceeds amid protests or efforts to block it read more here
your job is ministerial you have no discretion
party of projection that 's the election interference they always scream about they know they are losing on many fronts and instead of having a better platform and presidential candidate they are working hard to ensure they can steal elections like they do with gerrymandering
another trump lackey going to prison what ’s the count now
and everyone expects him to die from alcohol withdrawals shortly thereafter
bannon who is 70 has already been assigned an inmate number by the federal bureau of prisons 05635 509 i like his new nickname
best news in the last 24 hours
aww poor guy having to face the consequences of his actions s
trump is next in line
no booze for 4 months could literally kill this guy
i hope he runs 4 months is n't enough for this shit stain
ohh no enjoy your last weekend steve
he can use the time to write his own “ mein kampf ”
sing it with me to the tune of tommy tutone ’s 867 5309 jenny everyone 05635 509 ’
do they still make inmates shower and then spray them with de lousing medicine they would be a huge moneymaker on payperview
hope he tries to flee
so glad he will be behind bars on july 4th fucking awesome and peter navarro will still be jail on that day too
well at least there ’s this
he still gets a weekend he should be tackled shackled and spackled he should have some road rash on his ugly face
will he use the weekend to detox or opt for white knuckling it in the clink
this scumbag will get a pardon if trump is elected guaranteed
wonder if he ’ll be tortured as much as trump claims he was in georgia
wellp this guys weekend is going to suck womp womp
arguably one of the most deserving of prison time in the entire republican party fuck this guy i hope he rots in prison
the supreme court does a bunch of shady things that solely benefit conservatives and then they throw liberals a bone like this
good behavior out in 2 weeks
i assume someone will be there safely and legally to film this for posterity
i do not even remember what he is going to jail for
he could 've paid them to get the verdict he wanted it legal now
these pictures of bannon are just typical rock bottom right before rehab or death
oh darn so what ’s for dinner
na na na naaana hey hey goodbye
i do kind of like how despite them stacking the courts and trying to appeal they still lose in the past has people appealed like this so much all of trumps luckiest keep appealing
let us all take a moment of silence for the poor corrections officers that are gon na have to strip search jabba the hutt on monday x
what membership tier of us justice do you have to be in to be kindly told to go to jail for multiple weeks instead of being apprehended and incarcerated
sat hi to nasty nate
he is still going to appeal to the full court of appeal he has friends there he is not in prison yet
hope them boys throw his ass in the shower
one little ray of sunshine in the otherwise cloudy day
those dts are gon na be hell
that train keeps on rollin down on to san anton
haha thoughts and prayers shitbag
please watch the airports and border crossings
does he seriously get out a couple days before the election
looks like someone could n’t come up with a large enough “ gratuity ”
wishing you a painful withdrawal steve
what ’s with this countdown is he expecting to be killed immediately
aww is steve bannon having a bad weekend
so what now does he flee the country or just not show up
can i appeal my parking ticket to the us supreme court i feel like i need to fully utilize my options who tf gets to appeal their prison sentence to the supreme court who but these dirtbags why tf are they ruling on some dirtbags sentence why tf are they ruling on their buddy 's sentence how is this not an illegitimate use of the courts what new legal interpretation is so important that it needs to go to the supreme court
wish his prison sentence was starting in february
love him or hate him no american should be cheering people being sent to prison for “ contempt of congress ” imagine if a republican majority congress starts sending democrats to prison for the same the d is starting to stand for dictators this is the kind of thing that will get trump elected we should n’t cheer this kind of an abuse of power it would be different if they busted him with something legitimate but this is just alarming we have to de weaponize the justice system from going after political opponents
pls pls pls have the media all over his walk into prison
oh it ’s only 4 mouths
he was only sentenced to 4 months in prison if bannon had stfu and and just done the time this would have been over months ago
what ’s the count now not enough
8 jailed many charged not to mention hundreds of jan 6 rioters
when 's tommy tutone recording the song
glad to see a true republican taking personal responsibility
he could sober up and become even worse
yes they do they will have to peel 8 9 shirts off the flea bag first
tar and feathered like in old cartoons
pretty outrageous how the system treats criminals differently chappelle 's skit is relevant here
he does n't have enough tome to detox he 's going to have the dt 's for quite a while prison is n't supposed to be easy
his alcohol dependency and withdrawl will be managed by prison physicians detoxification of chemically dependent inmates
when congress subpoenas you you have to appear
no no they 'd have to give him the verdict he wants and he pays later
i mean i guess but it would be after he already went to prison there would be no getting those 4 months back for that bloated sack of whale shit
he would have served his time already if he got elected so no
why if t45 becomes t47 he 'd be able to pardon him this way bannon actually has to do his time do n't worry this is just the warm up for his build the wall scam conviction
a person is legally required to comply with a subpoena plain and simple while it is legal to evade being served a subpoena once received you can be charged with contempt for ignoring it if you are found guilty of contempt one of the possible punishments is jail time this is standard legal procedure not limited to congress and regardless of which party holds the majority
cool now when is jim jordan getting his
yeah contempt of congress is only a misdemeanor fortunately he 's facing actual felonies later this year in the we build the wall prosecution that can carry some heavy time
he 's a raging alcoholic it 's gon na be a rough 4 months for him
at the very least this should keep him from podcasting any more before the election
i 'd say more like 1 mouth 4 weiners
1 800 hot steev steve bannon ’s four mouths “ pick a flap and poke it ”
probably published by a sympathizer so that fans can send gifts and money to bannon in prison
not from a prison cell
when does gym jordan get arrested that 's one smug bastard i want to see arraigned
4 sober months in a hot ass prison
well yeah he ca n't commute the sentence since it was already served but he can certainly pardon him
because if t47 becomes president i want this f cker no where in the vicinity of the levers of power bannon is slated to be shadow president and is currently running the hr department for project 2025 right now bannon is basically another alex jones screaming his alcohol soaked head off into the ether of angertainment podcasts come february he may have actual real power and that 's a scary thought
were it contempt of court i ’m with you 100 % we are a nation of laws and to protect our civilized society we must adhere to the courts presiding over those laws he showed up to court but contempt of congress i ca n’t think of a single impartial person on either side of the aisle there is n’t an incentive to be that place is a circus right now just look at mtj or aoc both left and right are always on the lookout for the next gotcha clip they can use to solidify them with their bases be it the far right elements or the far left elements they are currently pandering to the extremes that ’s a huge conflict of interest to then give them the ability to enforce legal subpoenas on individuals simply because it lands well with their base he worked for trump and was advised by a lawyer not to testify because executive privilege overrode the right congress to force him to testify against his constitutional rights because they are n’t technically a court it was bad advice when subpoenaed by the court he showed up now he ’s going to prison for not participating in that circus we watched on tv that ’s extreme now that the precedent has been set so the next time the needle swings right during us elections as it has in europe south america and canada the republicans will also abuse this new power too and in true congressional fashion they ’ll try to take a few more inches than the other side got away with this is letting pandora out of the box and we should all be against it the left found a legal loophole and abused it without foresight this will be the 51 % “ nuclear option ” all over again but this time it ’s the tool for “ say what we want you to or we will charge you with contempt of congress and you will go to prison ” this guy seems slimy it ’s easy to cheer against him i get it but how he is going to prison should matter and this is clearly imprisoning him because of his politics that ’s scary people are cheering today will they cheer tomorrow when it ’s used against their own i doubt it i ’m far more centrist than right wing so i ’ll be against it with you then too but i ’ll have wished you had n’t waited so long to pull the wool off your eyes
yep now this current sentence can factor into his next conviction criteria
what did eric holder get
detox on the government 's dime and room and board too i am not seeing a downside for him hoping later trials extend his stay at the crossbar hotel
four months is just enough time to ferment some orange wine in his toilet tank
he can get moonshine in prison
fact it ’s a joke that the media is even running a story on this
“ 509 meet bubba he ’s what we like to call “ friendly ”
the disgusting thing is that there 's nothing in the law that says he ca n't
he 'll be getting the shakes after 4 hours so surviving 4 months is in question
i do n’t think you get it
i assume t47 is trump if that 's the case you do realize that if he takes power again he could just wave his ketchup stained sharpie and pardon bannon delaying this shitbag 's prison stay would n't have accomplished anything in such a case his going now at least gives us the illusion of the taste of some measure of justice
unless he gets the so badly it severely injures him
nope the joke is the sentencing not the coverage this should be bigger news
i mean the founding fathers could n't think of everything
he can run from a prison cell he just ca n't win law abiding patriots will not vote for him he 's burned those bridges all he has left is maga nut bags
i keep seeing this comment about him going into withdrawal which i believe also but everyone is acting like a rich white man is n’t going to get medical care in prison regardless withdrawal sucks but he will survive
i do n't give a flying f ck about whatever piss ant little crimes he 's committed so he grifted a bunch of his own rubes and ignored a congressional subpoena cool does n't really affect most of us if he 's back in the white house come 2025 he will have a major impact on all of us whether we like it or not because his job will be to implement project 2025 while trump is the useful idiot playing tv president and signing whatever bannon puts in front of him
it would have kept him out of the white house at a crucial moment if trump should win there 's virtually no difference with respect to public interest whether he serves his term now or in eight months
let me help you also where 's the charges for gym jordan for defying a congressional subpoena quit trying to act like this is all slanted against republicans this shit goes both ways
i hope to eat crow but every day i 'm finding it harder and harder to hold on to that hope
if you have some sort of source for that claim i 'll happily eat my words but i 'm pretty damn sure that the founders in their infinite wisdom did n't think to address whether or not the president could run the country from prison and i really wish i still had my head in the sand about trump 's odds but much of this country is frankly too incapable of critical thought to reason their way out of voting for trump i do n't like the current table odds of america becoming entirely a fascist nation i want off mr trump 's wild ride
mark meadows and mo brooks skating on everything m even slimy scavino will urk me to no end mo brooks knew and wore a bulletproof vest omg
you did n't understand what i wrote he can run for president he just won t win maybe this is clearer for you since you are so literal he ca n't win if he 's in prison because he wo n't win the vote no law abiding patriot will vote for someone sitting in prison do i need to paint you a picture
no picture needed you live in a parallel universe
well the sc just gutted chevron so most likely it 's the end of companies having to follow rules or be held accountable
pro dead worker party back at it again
maybe this will get some of them to not vote for republicans but i highly doubt it
the same workers are voting for them
of course it is rolling back regulation helps the operators make money by avoiding the costs associated with keeping their workers from unnecessary exposure to nasty airborne particles sadly people who work in mining extraction milling and industrial settings are going to pay the price for this sort of regulatory rollback and i hope these people do not put trust in their bosses to protect them
wonder how much thomas and alito got for this
who cares the fuck about you workers when rich and powerful and running the country
unreal that crap shreds your lungs osha rules are already lax as they are when the company can just pay a small fine for small hazardous projects a complete collapse of empathy for your fellow man
republican electeds know they can do this as long as they keep feeding rural republicans the vitriol against cities nonwhites and immigrants that they crave
omg you would ’ve thought we would ’ve learned with asbestos
how difficult would it be to find out who they are and connect them to those in congress who are blocking the rule
to be fair this union actually endorses some non republican candidates i really do n’t doubt who they will endorse for president
get em miners call out their greed for profits and kickbacks over you and your family health and welfare vote blue for you
the miners will vote for the scumbags though
unless the rule specifically states how much exposure or how many ppm is okay then the law was doa regardless now
i 'm telling you maga and trumpy faye baker are destroying everything decent in this country
someone needs to educate congress about
more likely why did biden do this
the union predominantly endorsed democratic candidates over republican they also petitioned joe manchin the support biden ’s infrastructure bills these people are certainly not going to switch to voting for the people taking away their rights
this is happening everywhere it 's caused by the systemic refuse to notice or address the needs of the people this lets the populists be uncontested
the union has a track record of endorsing democratic candidates over republicans for decades now just because they ’re laborers does n’t mean they ’re right wing
of course it provided exposure limits action level of 25 micrograms m 3 with a pel over an 8 hour shift of 50 micrograms m 3 why would you think that they might make a rule without exposure limits
haha yeah that will be their response after voting straight r
you got it all wrong obama is secretly running the show ' damn you obama for blocking the silica dust rule '
as of yesterday these limits must be in the law not just a regulation written by an expert
does anyone really think that trump is not racist i mean that ’s a big part of his appeal to his base
“ the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he ’s allowed to come in through the border ” trump said “ they ’re taking black jobs now and it could be 18 it could be 19 and even 20 million people they ’re taking black jobs and they ’re taking hispanic jobs and you have n’t seen it yet but you ’re gon na see something that ’s going to be the worst in our history ”
if he was against someone alive in that debate he would have eaten him alive for that black job remake wtf is a black job how is this not straight up racist
i mean that would have been the take home line had biden held it together right like mitt romney ’s “ binders full of women ” line in 2012 we need to press trump in what he means by black jobs ’ sounds like something storm thurmond or george wallace would have said
good good anger more of the democratic base so you lose you clown
his dad was kkk of course he was raised racist
also are we going to ignore the fact that he also fronted the great replacement theory by saying immigrants are coming here to replace us i have n’t seen anyone talk about it and that ’s insane
black and hispanic jobs you know like mowing the grass at his country clubs he 's the great white savior
good i was hoping someone would catch that
it ’s not democratic anger it ’s anger people of color who may have been flirting with voting for him may be taken aback biden on the other hand did n’t talk about racialized jobs he talked of training for high tech jobs at hbcus it ’s not hard to say a similar thing in a non racist or anti racist way like always trump has the defenders looking for plausible deniability everywhere “ that ’s not what he meant you ’re twisting his words ” i ’ll just say listen to his words yourself and judge yourself figure out if he means to help people of color or not you do n’t need a trump translator you ’ve got ears of your own
i am dominican a professional engineer and the president of my own small engineering firm with 4 employees am i holding a hispanic job
i know of one “ black job ” president of the united states of america
the real travesty is blacks and hispanics will continue to vote for this clown even after he puts them down time and time again
i m confused are their specific jobs that are considered black or hispanic jobs
can we please have a sane candidate under 65 i do n't really care left or right just not on deaths doorstep please
immediately after the second commercial break moderator dana bash asked president biden about black unemployment black families black mothers black americans and black voters notice the pattern black is used as an adjective modifying a noun biden 's answer mentioned small black businesses black unemployment black americans black families and black childcare costs notice the pattern black is used as an adjective modifying a noun what are black businesses businesses owned by black people presumably what 's black unemployment unemployment that affects black people etc trump 's rebuttal mentioned black families black people and black jobs notice the pattern black is used as an adjective modifying a noun what are black jobs jobs held by black people presumably if a black business is an innocent term denoting a business owned by a black person how is a black job not an innocent term denoting a job held by a black person
oh but did you hear this is totally good but biden needs to step down
i just want to make sure that i understand democrats this is okay if you have a problem figuring out whether you ’re for me or trump then you ai n’t black ’ this is not okay black jobs
i do n’t think trump means bond traders or investment banker jobs trump knows that blacks and hispanics ca n’t do jobs like those right
this is hilarious now start whining about black and hispanic joblessness
it ’s funny people are mad over this when biden said “ black childcare ” before trump spoke on the topic
that debate just makes me think the most lucid man in this election had brain worms at one point
it ’s not racist to call a job a black job racial demographics can be exploited to bring an owner more profit in this case black jobs are the poorly paid jobs that employers make a lot of profit from because black people are easy to exploit for resources china knows this russia knows this any country that practices colonialism knows this
god you guys a whiners 100 % what he said is true illegal immigration takes jobs from the lowest skilled workers which as a percentage are typically minority majorities what is racist about stating a fact you let 11 12 million people it there is no doubt it will effect peoples jobs maybe this is why his support amongst these voters has doubled literally doubled i have no dog in that fight just the facts
affirmative action is another way of saying the same thing
black jobs are jobs in america that black people work in not the occupations that black people have what trump is saying is that the illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from everybody and the topic question was on black people specifically trump is n't racist come on guys
he 's got a black friend who he killed with covid so it 's all good in the hood rite black people identify with him because he 's got a mugshot just like them breathtakingly racist makes my head spin biden won that debate i do n't care if he sounded raspy
the comments he made about leveling gaza and palestinians are n’t being talked about enough either
he ’s an old rich famous county club white guy he ’s racist af and that ’s how people were in his day he does n’t give 2 shjts about black hispanic anything there is his class and everyone else
i was watching the debates the dude was about 05 seconds away from saying “ the blacks ” when he was rambling on about stuff stopped short i was like “ oooooh sheet here it comes ” now that would have been interesting had he blurted that out
i ’m hispanic i know what he meant not offended at all
this article is so confusing was i hearing things or did biden say blacks have no money
you say this and probably back affirmative action who ’s the racist
manipulative yes fear mongering yes racist no stop diluting what that word means until no one takes it seriously he is just placing emphasis on a particular community
thanks for the quote yep that is some pretty racist shit right there
honestly i think he meant to argue that migrants are taking black people 's jobs and hispanic people 's jobs too not that low paying jobs are for blacks or hispanics obviously that 's bs too and i am in no way denying that trump is a massive racist who believes minorities deserve to be second class citizens it 's just that hispanic jobs makes little sense in other contexts considering most of the migrants are hispanic themselves it sounds more like a ploy to attract black and hispanic voters by saying that illegal immigrants will take their jobs
you know what a black job is fred trump 's ghost most definitely
the ones where people say “ yes boss sure thing boss anything you say boss ” total racist bs
please explain how it is racist i mean he obviously meant that illegal immigrants steal jobs from the black community just like when people say they 're stealing our jobs it is clear he saying that it is a net negative for everyone while emphasizing a specific community how does anyone interpret this as racist like i do nt like trump but i just do not understand
yes like he was ever going to flip any democrats
because to imply that illegals are coming after black jobs is saying that blacks generally have low skill jobs
he does need to step down
how is emphasizing a specific community racist is dei racist now because they want more black people in certain positions if not then why is trump racist for not wanting jobs stolen from black communities is dei for women suddenly sexist just because orange man said it bad
can we elect just the brain worms instead
a lot of shit is n’t talked about because the media hyper focuses on biden ’s age as if trump is n’t just 3 years younger than biden
he would n’t say it if it did n’t play right to the animal spirits of his party nothing you can say to change their mind
the israeli government is pro leveling gaza too american politicians are completely incapable of contradicting israel because they 're all cowards apparently
trump cares for no one and nothing other then trump anything with him is a one way street to benefit the orange menace at the expense of others he ’s proven that over and over for decades just look at the “ central park five ” he ruined those mens lives they spent decades in prison before the truth came out
let me make sure i am reading this correctly you ’re calling me a racist based on some assumption you just made up without knowing me at all
he has a long history of being a racist moron you ’re acting like this is an isolated thing
what does racism mean then
sure sure he is just placing negative stereotypical emphasis on a particular community people of color but it does n’t mean racism
that ’s exactly what he ’s arguing with all of his usual elegance he is making the “ they took yer jobs ” argument and trying to direct it at black and brown people
there is absolutely no such thing as a black job even in the context you made that 's not a black job poor people job maybe but that 's all ethnicities saying black job implies that in the eua there is jobs made for blacks exclusively for some reason that immigrants are somehow gon na steal even if they are n't black the entire notion makes zero sense unless you start at a racist notion that blacks deserve to work specific jobs that are easily replaced by immigrants
but biden sure can make some people stay home he needs to be replaced
because to imply that illegals are coming after black jobs is saying that blacks generally have low skill jobs are you implying that undocumented migrants are generally low skilled
dei is racist is it required to create a more equal society that is a different conversation as to orange man ’s comments why would he point out “ black ” or “ hispanic ” jobs why not just “ american jobs ” unless he was dog whistling
i mean do you have to like trump or want to vote for him to think he is the most lucid or can i dislike him and be fucking honest that he has more mental capacity than biden have we really devolved to being unable to criticize or admit the negatives of who we support
there is no world where biden is more mentally lucid than trump or kennedy
it 's not about age yo it 's about coherence and delivery
do you reckon there ’s a reason for that in that trump appears to be 15 years younger than biden
so you do n’t back affirmative action okay good i apologize
i 'm saying this specific things is not racist do not assume my position on him as a whole i do n't like him can you elaborate as to how it is racist
genuinely wondering who he is being racist to perhaps it is my autism but i just do not get it
i utterly despise trump and gop but i honestly do n't understand how it 's racist who do you think he is placing this stereotype on perhaps i 'm wrong but i thought he was claiming that blacks and hispanic are losing jobs to illegal immigrants other hispanics so is arguing in favor of 2 groups of color us citizens to be able to keep their jobs instead of having to compete with another group of people non us citizens racist if so against which group of color if this is racist then how is the affirmative action that we have now which helps certain groups of color blacks and hispanics to the disadvantage of other groups of color asians also racist i was under the impression and i think that neither is racist but we have to apply the same standard
and that 's quite racist if it 's not racist then he would just say that everyone should vote for him because he will stop people from taking anyone 's job but no it 's specifically african americans latin americans and immigrants
stop thinking like an employee and start thinking like an employer think about how to profit in poor communities you do that by keeping labor costs low guess who ’s more likely to accept the poorly paid jobs that help keep labor costs low
he just means jobs in communities that are predominantly black and hispanic
and the other person who can make democrats stay home all the people saying shit like this over and over and over again bunch of new random named accounts saying the same things and agreeing with each other
no but it 's tough to get a job in other fields as an illegal
i just want to put this out there i have asperger 's so sometimes i just do n't understand things the way other people do how i interpreted it was how in the past when someone says illegal immigrants are stealing american jobs people often assume they mean white americans vs hispanic immigrants and call the person claiming this a racist you have to have seen that before right so as far as my understanding goes trump is trying and failing to avoid that by saying a group of illegal immigrants is stealing jobs from group b american people of color so i 'm genuinely confused on which group of color that 's racist to i 'm sorry if i 'm dense no whether we think his claim is true is another story
we 're talking about this reality not the maga alternate reality
yeah and at no point is trump as coherent as biden or deliver his “ talking points ” as anything other than a raving lunatic
trump never appears in public without about 8 kilograms of makeup and is hyper obsessed with his personal appearance where biden clearly does n’t care beyond looking professional
thank you i believe everyone should have the same opportunities without “ tipping the scales ” in anyone ’s favor
did you read the article the phrase “ black jobs ” was widely condemned by democrats and black leaders as vague and insulting i ’m still wondering what is a black job ’ ” jaime harrison chair of the democratic national committee quipped on friday during a news conference with former georgia democratic gubernatorial nominee stacey abrams in atlanta other prominent biden allies including rep jasmine crockett d tx rep bennie thompson d miss and raphael warnock d ga also condemned trump ’s words following the debate “ there is no such thing as a black job that misinformed characterization is a denial of the ubiquity of black talent we are doctors lawyers school teachers police officers and firefighters the list goes on ” said derrick johnson president and ceo of the naacp “ a black job ’ is an american job it ’s concerning that a presidential candidate would seek to make a nonexistent distinction but the divisive nature of this comment is not surprising for donald trump ”
anyone with a smaller bank account different color skin etc unless you can prove useful to his ends dosn’t matter who you are unless he wants something then after he gets it will go back to what it was he would raise rents to keep minorities out of his properties solely on the color or language they spoke
even in this scenario even if he was talking about that black jobs is still the way wrong term saying the immigrants are gon na steal jobs in marginalized communities is one thing saying they are gon na steal black jobs is another all together
reddit has a severe spam problem they ’re just political manipulators rather than ads for viagra they could do something about it easily they just do n’t want to
i ’m talking about more than him being a pale corpse it ’s his slurring fouled up pattern of speech too he ’s a dying man he walks like it too
not to defend the shit gibbon but you ca n't be racist against bank accounts because you know bank account is n't a race words mean things
biden has always had a stutter that is nt an age thing it 's literally just him being human
keep your head buried in the sand
a bit from the commentary donald trump has bragged about being “ proudly the person responsible ” for ending roe v wade make no mistake he bears responsibility for flipping the balance of the court and for everything that has happened as a result but trump is n’t alone every mainstream republican candidate running for a seat in the united states senate would be a vote for a national abortion ban and they wo n’t stop there in the last month alone republican senators have blocked democratic legislation to protect access to birth control and ivf these positions are deeply unpopular and disqualifying to voters so just like donald trump their only hope of getting elected is to shamelessly lie and hide their records we ca n’t let that happen
you better vote for biden folks if you do n’t they will pass a national abortion ban and trump will sign it
it depends on what the meaning of the word is ’ is
no offense but facts history don't matter for a single thing on tv any counter example you do n't get a special award for not lying liars win all the time so confused
new south governor clinton gave a horribly boring speech at the ' 88 dnc so bad that the crowd starting cheering when he said he was almost done and any hopes he had on a national stage ended that night
biden overall has done a solid job and surrounded himself with solid people i do n't see how one less than perfect debate performance undermines all that also seeing him at his next rally he seemed fine
i ’m watching biden on tv at his nc rally right now and the guy is fucking crushing it super high energy and the crowd is going bonkers this is a biden we need
heres a fact and a little history this pedophile was on epsteins island so maybe his opinion does n’t matter
“ i did not have sexual relations with that woman ”
this right here is a scramble for independents that see something they like in trumps alley cat morality
not to trump supporters they do n't and unfortunately they are just about the most consistent voters there are vote everybody
i am way too young uh kinda ouch to have voted for him but clinton was a consummate politician seriously ridiculously intelligent guy and charming public speaker the only recent comparable democrat who achieved that level of success was obama who was also absurdly good at this
facts matter never a south carolina governor wow
it was a dismal performance but i would vote for joe biden ’s corpse over trump
because he was likely shot full of drugs to give him energy honestly i 'm shocked they did n't do that before the debate
idk he still seems pretty messed up
problem is he can only do that in front of a teleprompter
read it a little more carefully new south governor is a term applied to various governors who led states in the southern united states in the latter half of the twentieth century politically moderate these governors were viewed as broadly progressive avoiding racial rhetoric and advocating reform of government institutions
me when i ca n’t read the whole post
you did not watch it if you thought that speech in raleigh was bad assuming you are n't just complaining that he coughed because he still has a cold
he ’s riffing live you can tell a lot of it is freehand
my bad did n’t have glasses on
this he performed as well as i ’ve ever seen him and it is n’t the teleprompter you can tell he ’s riffing most of the time and he ’ll did great
i ’m sure he is riffing some he has the structure of the speech on the teleprompter to keep his train of thought he ca n’t listen react and keep his train of thought without the teleprompter that ’s the difference
all this makes me think in this system what is the effect of the enormous costs incurred by litigants making their cases up through our judicial system put simply does this not ensure that the interests of the owners of capital can continuously rise while those without such power that wealth creates will systematically be unable to plead their legal interests seems simple to me and not a good design
this all part of the project 2025 plan make decisions to consolidate power with the president by dismantling existing law
at this point i think we need to stop pretending that the current scotus has any authority they 're just playing in a temporary sandbox that only exists in their minds the damage they are causing must and will be fixed
while we are all rightfully distracted by the disaster of biden and the grave threat posed by trump people have to pay attention to this this case was the real end goal of the conservative billionaire movement this is why citizen 's united happened this case right here portends the destruction of the federal government 's ability to regulate anything all of the culture war bs is a distraction from the actual goal the merging of corporate power and governmental power of making the powers of government exist to serve corporate profit interests alone this case is a milestone victory for those seeking to permanently entrench themselves as our overlords up next will be a push to formalize the doctrine of non delegation which would completely eliminate agency rule making meaning that all regulations would be promulgated by congress this would mean the functional end of the federal government as congress is a failed body
the people 's power our government is an exercise of the power of the masses the supreme court is transferring that power to a handful of rich people
the republicans on the supreme court are there to make sure nothing interferes with corporate profit and or billionaire wealth other than the republicans wo n't let us why have n't the dems done anything to prevent this from happening 14 years since citizens united and they have done nothing we are at war and losing project 2025 has already started clean your guns people or doom your grandchildren to slavery but they would have learned slavery good teaches skills by then so they will be excited and joe wants to talk about the traitor lol
thanks a lot ruth could have and should have retired early under obama but stubbornly refused now we are fucked every good thing she did is now destroyed
some of the main issues identified in the article the case started as garden variety securities fraud according to sec findings the radio host george jarkesy stole from his investors by lying to them about his investment strategy lying about his auditor and prime broker and lying about his take to protect the integrity of the financial markets the sec forced jarkesy to disgorge his ill gotten gains and banned him from the securities industry it also fined him 300 000 for good measure this is where the story should have ended instead two republican appointed judges on the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit made jarkesy into a cause célèbre in recent years that court has repeatedly endorsed fringe right wing legal efforts such as when it struck down access to mifepristone nationwide a decision later overturned by the supreme court this has made it into a preferred forum for conservative activists seeking to use the judiciary to advance right wing projects among which attacking the federal government ’s ability to regulate industry is a top priority in may 2022 a divided panel of the fifth circuit issued a sweeping ruling holding that the public officials known as administrative law judges such as the one who adjudicated the claims against jarkesy were unconstitutionally insulated from presidential control that the powers the sec exercised had been unconstitutionally delegated and that because the sec sought to impose a fine on jarkesy he was entitled to a jury trial this ruling placed the foundations of federal administration in jeopardy if the supreme court upheld it in full much of the government would have ceased to be able to operate because many different agencies would have become unconstitutional and tens of thousands of adjudications would have been thrown into question the supreme court avoided this terrifying course but it did not steer the country away from it rather it opened new avenues for ideological critics to chip away at government power at the same time it gave itself more power to control the operations of the executive branch the decision opens up avenues for much future destruction going to court takes significant agency resources requiring that agencies pursue suits in front of federal judges and juries for monetary damages will lead to fewer enforcement actions seeking financial penalties and doing so could have many strange and unpredictable consequences perhaps agencies will act more like prosecutors seeking ruinous fines to compel plea bargains and enforcing “ trial penalties ” on defendants who refuse or maybe they will rely less on money damages and more on other remedies which are arguably harsher many would rather pay a fine than see their license to practice in their field revoked will defendants in fact get to have their cases heard by a jury of their peers unlikely civil jury trials are already difficult to get and corporate actors will almost certainly prefer to let a judge find facts and decide on damages rather than try their luck with unpredictable juries the deeper problem is structural though nothing in the constitution required this outcome the text of the seventh amendment does not say that securities fraud claims must go in front of a federal judge the courts at westminster in 1789 would never have heard a case about a fraudster inflating the value of his fund assets to pay himself higher fees whether the claims against jarkesy needed to go to a federal court or could be heard by an agency is a question of policy in 2010 in the aftermath of the enron scandal the president and congress decided that those cases could be heard by the sec they enacted that decision into law through the dodd frank act which gave the sec the enforcement power at issue in the case relying on nothing but its own opinion the supreme court disagreed and struck part of that act down to force the sec to go into federal court this is a dangerous act of judicial aggrandizement worse the supreme court did not explain the limits or logic of its reasoning many agencies pursue enforcement actions that have common law analogs and have done so for decades it is unclear whether they too will now need to go in front of federal judges this confusion is a powerful weapon with the demise of chevron deference in the loper bright case today agencies have lost the power to construe ambiguous statutes leaving them uncertain about their authority as if this were not dangerous enough more ominous developments seem in the offing the supreme court set aside and did not rule in any way on the fifth circuit ’s two most extreme holdings that the sec ’s powers were an unconstitutional delegation and that administrative law judges were unconstitutionally insulated those claims will surely resurface in the future if they win the court ’s approval they will create a generational upheaval in government practice clarity and consistency should be some of the goals of any ruling by the courts rulings that run counter to this and rather create uncertainty or confusion are clearly ones that indicate that something has gone wrong somewhere either in legislation or in judgment or both in this case it appears that this confusion is deliberate and this should be examined closely by legislators as this directly affects their ability to govern edit vocab
welcome to the republican deep state
this is anarcho tyranny these corrupt judges just let corpos do whatever they want just like citizens united
why would want the government to have more power
yeah this is fucking bad the us was already a capitalist oligarchy basically now it 's elysium type shit where the rich destroy everything with zero consequence and then leave earth when it 's inhabitable 100 200 years from now
overturning chevron does the opposite of that courts can now decide if the executive branch is properly interpreting laws it puts executive orders at risk in even the lower courts and that 's a good thing
realistically we all need to be thinking about what “ fixing it ” will look like and if it can actually be achieved the fix is legislative which is an extremely tall order in our 50 50 split polarized congress even with majorities the filibuster will need to be removed and then we need to deal with the fact that this supreme court has shown it will strike down any law it does n’t like and will fabricate a justification to suit their wishes there needs to be overwhelming majorities in both houses plus we need to ensure a democrat is in office when alito and thomas ’s seats become available the democrats need to find a way to actually unite the party with leaders that are representative of the majority of the country asap if the conservatives get to replace alito and thomas the “ fix ” will be a generation or two away at best this was the point of 2016 man so many of us did not like clinton but we pulled the lever anyway we know how that turned out last time we really ca n’t gamble this one away in the same fashion
which of course would ultimately result in fascism
we ’re quickly moving towards a timeline where congress is an ornamental body at best like your grandmothers fine silverware and china we take them out every couple years and ogle at them and then do n’t pay them any mind afterwards
how does taking power away from a central authority increase plutocrats power our current government is absolutely not an exercise of the people ’s power
yup she shat all over her legacy by trying to extend it so much failure came out of 2016 and rbg is an often neglected part of it
it ’s crazy i actually do n’t think the majority of trump supporters want this but they are idiots and were content with culture war instead of understanding or being aware of what was lurking underneath it all i think we all were played left and right we ’re heading into the 4th of july i ’m not celebrating that holiday is moot now
because the corporations that can legally bribe the judges to rule they are allowed to put lead in food do n't care if they poison you and your children
it seems a lot of people here are authoritarian i did n't know people liked being ruled by unelected officials i hope you all read what undoing chevron actually means because it was the most pro democracy decision in a long time
leave earth that ’s the stupidest shit the rich is swallowing too and combined with solving aging none of these will work in the near future
the rich make their demise inevitable with every predatory overstep
nope courts always had the power to say that the executive ’s interpretations were n’t reasonable based on the statute they were dealing with now they do n’t have to go that far a judge can simply overrule a policy choice as long as they can come up with a different reasonable interpretation
that ’s a lot of fixing but when an sc judge dies the sitting president appoints another one of their choosing
what happened to law and order good question what happened to it certain forms of bribery are legal now other parts of the government no longer function we are potentially about to have our first ever convicted felon president you tell me what happened to law and order in this country
the funny thing is “ refusing to enforce supreme court rulings ” is kind of a republican thing that happens anytime people gain civil rights kim davis was a conservative icon for basically being a homophobe who would n’t certify marriage tickets but then now when it ’s being used to oppress people we should just follow these rulings
when the judges are corrupt why should theor judgements be honored
our current federal agencies regulate and enforce everything from the clean water act to the endangered species act you think billionaires like being told they ca n't dump pollution all over do you think you have a chance against them in court that 's novel
are you high who supports dismantling the authority of the federal government republicans why happens when they 're able to take any authority away corporations step into the power vaccuum and fuck us all over it 's happened literally every time why do you think they support it
unelected judges with lifetime appointments are a much more centralized and plutocratic group to be making policy choices than executive agency regulators who can be fired the power of regulators has not decreased at all the court has just claimed authority over that power for itself
this ruling combined with project 2025 could put the oligots on a short leash if any corporation does anything the republicans do n't like they will suddenly find themselves heavily regulated and facing massive legal consequences
it ’s the exact opposite jarkesky is different there ’s a decent argument for the conservative position even if it results in huge practical problems but with chevron they are rejecting democracy and usurping the constitutional authority of the executive for themselves rather than elected officials making policy decisions unelected judges with lifetime appointments now get to veto those choices without actually having to show that they are illegal
it ’s really cute that you think federal agencies have a net positive on your life
blaming the united states government for everything started as part of lost cause ideology it makes sense from that perspective
anyone who ’s not a government robot is in favor of dismantling federal authority
in what world are corporations fucking us all more than the government corporations use the government to fuck us more what rock are you living under
the courts are n’t taking this power courts do n’t make policy they ’re adding a check to agency authority but how people trust the corrupt revolving doors that are running all the agencies i will never understand
our representatives should be making the law in a democracy you should read the case closely and see this was about reigning in the power of the unelected
that ’s the stupidest thing i ’ve read in my entire life and i browse flat earth and other conspiracy groups
i assume you do n't drink water use roads or exercise property rights that 's right property rights exist because there is a government the idea that everyone has to respect your stuff without a central authority is nuts i suppose maybe a new government will instantly arise that says that your property is protected but what 's most likely is you 'll get eaten with everyone else i notice many redditors pretend like the government does n't actually establish our property rights the right to own anything the right to not have your shit randomly taken by a bully edit a word
what a trope that certainly is n't true people who want to run ragged over our rights and environment want to dismantle federal authority animosity towards the federal government stems largely from the civil war desegregation and environmental regulation i can assure you many of us have benefited from things like the voting rights act the fact that you 're so adamant about dismantling the thing that protects americans from systemic abuse tells me where you 're coming from on a bunch of issues
so no actual answer just i 'm right and all the cool people think i 'm right you might be an actual robot
sorry i 'm a fan of clean food air and water corps wo n't give me that
compare your salary to that of the executives that run your company corporations corrupt the government so there is nothing stopping them from fucking everyone and everything as hard as they possibly can
the courts already could check executive power by ruling that an agency ’s interpretation of a legally ambiguous issue is n’t reasonable based on the authority granted by congress that is their proper role but this allows them to do that by only showing that there is some other reasonable choice which the judge prefers it does n’t matter if the agency ’s interpretation is also reasonable that means the courts will be exercising policy discretion rather than just calling balls and strikes that is a usurpation of executive power and a limitation of legislative power to delegate authority to the executive revolving doors are good if agencies use their power in ways that people do n’t like voters can elect a new president or pressure an administration to fire those particular regulators so as not to lose the next election if courts use that power in ways that people do n’t like too bad they ’ve got lifetime appointments
they are n’t limiting anything the power of regulators to interpret ambiguities in statutes passed by congress and implement policies based on those interpretations remains exactly the same it ’s just now a court can veto those decisions based on the judge or justices ’ own policy preferences rather than having to show that the agency ’s interpretation was n’t reasonable as was the case before so in practice policies that favor the interests of wealthy conservative donors will be upheld while those disfavored by those donors wo n’t be that ’s all
alright well luckily the majority of voters and the supreme court are n’t as stupid as you
nsa ice doj fbi fisa patriot act all responsible for countless civil and human rights violations with no accountability all expanding their authorities without congressional approval the list of cia abuses is books long the epa has been responsible for environmental contaminations and is responsible for flint michigan the department of health is responsible for our incoherent health system the list goes on and on you ’re absolutely delusional to believe these agencies are doing you any favors
the only way to ensure good clean food is through free market capitalism the usda literally lied about the nutrition pyramid because corporations paid them to influence people to eat carbs and other bad foods the us food supply is the worst known the planet the usda has been prioritizing corporations over people for decades and it shows
executive running corporations are the same people running government agencies corporations have captured federal agencies for decades just look at the food pyramid or how oxycodone was approved so why would we want to increase that power
we can agree selective enforcement is corrupt when it gets to the point where lawmaking can be delegated to unelected officials that is not a democracy the point of those entities are enforcement branches allowing them to interpret broad powers is very dangerous and authoritarian
they have congressional approval and funding and they have both congressional judicial and ig oversight blaming the epa for flint is particularly galling considering that the state of michigan actively tried to block the federal government from issuing any emergency orders which is exactly what you seem to be advocating for and the fbi is by far the agency responsible for freeing the most victims of sex trafficking on the planet and no matter how many fantasy movies maga make about vigilantes saving children from pedophiles the fbi is the dedicated group of people actually doing the job
the only way to ensure good clean food is through free market capitalism so how 's that work someone gets food poisoning and sues the company sounds like a wonderful way to clog the legal system and ensure no sort of penalty is ever assessed ensuring bad behaviors continue or maybe they 'll have something on the package in the same color font as the label so ypu ca n't see it by purchasing this item you waive the right to seek legal judgements against us and go into arbitration no regulation against it and they can poison you all they want you waived your legal rights when you bought it the usda literally lied about the nutrition pyramid because corporations paid them to influence people to eat carbs and other bad foods so your solution is to just let those corps write the rules wholesale get ready for brawndo it 's got things plants crave the us food supply is the worst known the planet the usda has been prioritizing corporations over people for decades and it shows so the corps pay the government to look the other way your solution is to be mad at the government and tell them to leave not only saving corps bribe money but also ensuring that they can keep doing the things they paid inspectors to look the other way for the corps will lie cheat and steal to more profits and you wo n't be able to stop them indeed you want them to give you more power to screw you over how much of this meat is grade a and how much is rat they do n't have to tell you is this made from people they do n't have to tell you you put sawdust in my bread hope you can pay for years of legal fees while some billionaire corporation strings you along for years maybe you 'll get paid or maybe you get cancer from the unregulated tailpipe exhausts from cars that have no emissions standards anymore we had an unregulated food market before ever read about it you ever read about restaurant kitchens before food standards tl dr enjoy your botulism
not when congress delegates that power to them if a law is passed saying something like “ it ’s illegal to dump carcinogenic chemicals into rivers ” along with text saying “ the epa is empowered to make determinations about what chemicals are carcinogenic and enforce this rule ” then it is not an unlawful power grab for the epa to identify a particular substance as causing cancer just because the statute does n’t identify it by name it ’s impossible for congress to explicitly identify every such chemical especially since new molecular formulations and scientific studies about their effects are developed as time goes on before a court could overrule the epa ’s application of that law if it was unreasonable if they showed that a substance causes some other disease besides cancer and tried to ban dumping it into rivers the court could say no but now a court could say “ you ’ve only showed that this chemical causes cancer in mice and we think that congress was only talking about humans so you ca n’t ban dumping of this substance that our billionaire friends would have to spend more money on properly disposing of if they ca n’t dump it ”
the fbi repeatedly violates people civic liberties so i believe there should be additional checks on their authority the epa is a bloated useless organization and should be gutted luckily the courts got it right this time and will hopefully continue in this direction
this is literally all conjecture
it 's a glimpse into what kinds of shortcuts corps will take to make more profits do you think that they wo n't cut corners for more profits what is the free market remedy for that
yeah but where 's the cruelty in that
highlights from this article according to new research the first year pilot program that provided no strings attached cash to 807 homeless adults also saved taxpayers significant money the savings manifested in program participants staying in homeless shelters less frequently requiring fewer ambulance rides emergency room visits and hospital stays and spending fewer nights in jail or drug and alcohol treatment centers a report released tuesday shows decreases in those categories added up to more than 589 000 saved according to estimates from researchers with the center for housing and homelessness research at the university of denver for a project that has paid out 9 4 million to participants since it was launched that total may not look like much but mark donovan the denver basic income project ’s founder and executive director is confident the stability the program has helped to create in many recipients ’ lives will only continue to bear fruit both for them and the denver community his hope is that the pilot program already extended into septemeber will continue to draw financial support that will allow for a three year experiment in how providing people with a basic income can change lives while none of the participants were obligated to participate in the research hundreds did researchers kept up with them through regular surveys including long form questionnaires at enrollment after six months of payments and after 10 months according to a summary released tuesday survey participation did fall throughout the study period while 631 participants completed surveys at enrollment just 457 did so at the six month mark and fewer still 396 did so in the final survey after 10 months of payments researchers attributed that decline to typical attrition even with the wide variances in monthly payments researchers found a significant increase in housing security across all three cohorts after 10 months of payments just 8 % of participants who filled out the survey at enrollment reported living in a house or apartment they rented at that time at the 10 month mark that increased to 45 % of enrollees surveyed including 43 % of those receiving just 50 per month perhaps unsurprisingly researchers saw substantial improvements in recipients ’ feelings of financial well being but the research also tracked an increase in employment among recipients roughly 23 % of recipients had full time jobs at enrollment at the 10 month mark that total had increased to 27 % “ one of the bigger critiques of a program like this is why are you going to give people money and disincentivize them from working ’ ” brisson said “ in fact that ’s not what we saw we gave people money and work increased ” the city has dedicated another 2 million to the project this year that matches denver ’s contributions to the pilot phase in 2023 that additional city funding coupled with other sources including 3 million from the nonprofit colorado trust has allowed the denver basic income project to extend payments to 673 previous recipients through at least september supporters are hopeful about carrying the program into 2025 the biggest barrier beyond ongoing funding is stigma maria sierra the project ’s community engagement manager said tuesday society defaults to more restrictions when providing benefits sierra said the denver basic income project ’s early outcomes demonstrate strict oversight is not necessary or even what ’s best when seeking to help people out of poverty “ it ’s a huge challenge to change the mindset change the narrative around the community that we ’re serving ” sierra said “ they know what ’s best for themselves and they do make the right decisions when they have access to a resource like direct cash to change their lives ” it 's heartening to see some successes with this kind of program and to see communities like denver taking on the challenge of figuring out ways to improve the lives of their residents and broader society the challenges with the old mindset that money or other assets is related in some way to personal virtue or worthiness is one that needs to be overcome if we are to truly solve some of the sticker problems that affect all of our communities
something that needs to be done nationally both for homelessness and coming job losses from ai it 's simply cheaper to give citizens money than to pay for services for them and it 's an immediate solution to countless issues from housing to healthcare
sorry this is a really complicated problem though and we need to rely on the free market to make more housing and ca n’t just give these people money s
for what it 's worth while biden had a really rough performance trump was n't any better tbh he just deflected questions with more passion and energy in the voice but he really did n't add anything of substance to the debate both of them are old both of them should be in retirement but one of them is nt creating a cabinet of sycophants hell bent on making the executive branch close to that of a monarchy one of them is actually willing to sit back and let his cabinet do their jobs instead of fellate their ego and one of them is possibly going to have the power to appoint 2 3 younger justices who will be on the court for a very long time
yes crystal clear a serial liar treasonous coward who is in bed with putin and an old man with a stutter and a sore throat
she is 100 % correct i hope voters focus on the actual message
i hope she runs in 4 years
this is our future president
it could n't be clearer before it either one accepts the democratic process to decide who leads a country and the other does n't
every trump talking point was something from a rally i could have told you what he was going to say
gov whitmer has a point let 's not lose focus on the real bad guy is in this election she should know she was at the center of a criminal plot to kidnap her by trump supporting lunatics and far right wing terrorists
one is an erratic megalomaniac and the other is a glassy eyed walking corpse god bless gerontocracy and the two party system
it ’s not about the difference between the two it ’s about the role of the presidency and having somebody who can do the job i think a replacement would do better politically but that ’s not the main motivation here
the debate made zero difference no one saw it and said man i 'm going with trump now anyone who says that was already going with trump
the us should be embarrassed after last night i ’m still voting for biden but seriously hope he drops out
one has dementia and the other is a malignant narcissist fml
we have an old guy and a crazy old guy yes i can tell the difference
we know what trump is and the republicans have done little to nothing to dispel exactly what and who he is for better or worse they wear trump on their sleeves the democrats on the other hand have hand waved concerns over biden ’s age would not listen to polling when it came to that very subject hold the opinion that democracy is on the line and will do absolutely nothing to move on from a candidate who acts as if he was summoned by a necromancer last night was the “ holy shit we ca n’t gas light our way out of this anymore ” and it ’s too late that ’s the attitude they should have had well over a year ago
weekend at bernie ’s vs baby hitler to run your country easy choice unless you ’re a fan of nazi ’s
we all saw the difference
she ’s right but you ca n’t think of this like a politically literate person no matter how you slice it optics are important the biden presidency has been a resounding success but people do n’t know it and he is failing to communicate it
one is awake the other should not be doing this
i agree could not be clearer lol
way to clear things up gretchen thanks
what ’s the difference they are both inept and wrong for the presidency it ’s like asking if you want to be shot in the big toe or the little toe neither of them should have been put into this position in the first place
ones crazy and ones senile
you got that right lol
yeah difference seemed about 30 odd years rather than three years as far as i could tell
agree usa is going down hill
one can string a sentence together one can not glad that ’s the bar the us presidency is held to
trump is pretty clearly the better candidate for the presidency
i 'll definitely be voting for the old guy who has not been adjudicated to be a sexual abuser defamer fraudster and felonious election interferer
biden could be in a literal vegetative state and he 's still the better candidate
and one of them is n't trying to win to keep his orange self out of prison
i think a lot of what we 're seeing today with conversations about biden is shock he is not in front of the public eye like trump was still is he 's not tweeting every day running around the country doing rallies like a traveling circus he 's just bein ' president i watched the whole thing and then watched a good chunk of it again i 'm not the normal viewer obviously but i wanted to get the most out of what i was seeing or torture myself i dunno and it seemed clear to me that biden was making every effort to offer good points and stumbling horrendously on a few while also trying to react to whatever the fuck trump was doing people are coming down on him for staring mouth open like he did n't know wtf was going on but i was making that same face listening to trump too so whatever the golf bit was cringey to me both times through but some other folks thought it was light hearted banter so what do i know i was honestly surprised with how well trump seemed to have it together i 've seem him far less coherent even in recent weeks that said by coherent i mean he was actually stringing sentences together in a manner that 's not his usual performance though to be fair he usually goes on a lot longer and would have if they had let him and eventually hits that stream of consciousness mindfuck that we all recognize i just do n't think he got the momentum for it last night to get up to 88 mph or we probably would have seem him spin out at some point he was still horrendously despicable demeaning and insulting unable to answer a question directly and completely off topic for literally 95 % of the debate at no point did the moderators have to say the question we asked you joe was but for trump well biden was fine today sure he was reading off a teleprompter he still had way more energy also had a noticeable cough take from that what you will could chalk that performance today up to all sorts of things though mundane or conspiratorial and i imagine that while this debate is definitely a black mark for his campaign it 's not nearly the disaster the media is painting it as democratic politicians are still supporting him to a one and even bernie and maybe that 's just a public face and maybe not maybe it 's damage control i do n't have the insider knowledge to make that claim and i 've not seen any media outlets able to credibly say that either aside from vague references to worried donors maybe just have n't read enough today i 've read enough for the love of god is he old well um yeah is he a man with a bad stutter under a pressure that arguably very few potus have even been under before having to literally defend the country against a traitor yup is he an incumbent president with the advantages that brings running against a historically hated human being that 's about to be sentenced in two weeks on 34 criminal charges check mark are we already seeing a lot of bounce back articles about donations and polling and surrogates coming to his aid and his performance today also yes is it damage control maybe but i just do n't see how anything in that debate really changes anything especially the hearts and minds of the electorate in one of the most galvanized voting populations in modern history if you were going to vote for trump or biden are you going to not do so now and will the ones that say no be statistically significant to make a difference i suppose that 's the big question other than maybe will one or both die before the election which is silly if putin gets a little too cornered hell we may all die before the election worthless speculation that i 'm not even going to start in on undecided voters again today had enough of that all of this just seems much ado about nothing but maybe i 'm just getting old
trump was n’t any better tbh i keep seeing this take and it seems like a weird way to draw equivalence the expectations of these two men going into the debate could not have been more different the thing is that everyone expected trump to lie and deflect and ramble the expectations were pretty damn set in stone for him he really did n’t deviate at all from what was expected of him for biden the expectations were higher they always are for the person standing opposite trump call trump on his lies clearly defend your record look and sound sharp he did n’t meet expectations at all he did the one thing that every major news outlet has hounded him over for the last 4 years the one thing that dems really really need people to not think about and he did it on national television trump lying and biden giving a really poor performance are n’t even close to the same significance
if biden wins clarence thomas and samuel alito will not retire out of spite however if trump gets in i feel like they will step aside for younger far right wingers it ’s likely the dems will have to win the next 2 presidencies to get any more justices only way forward is if the dems win the presidency this year as well as have super majorities in the house and senate then maybe we can try to reform the supreme court
politics 101 optics substance it always has been it always will be whishing otherwise is just dreaming
and the actual great job biden has done the last four years biden 's age is just this cycle 's but her emails we are n't electing biden to do well at debates
yep one guy 's actually trying to solve problems and the other guy literally ca n't do anything but lie
“ the actual message ” i support roe v wade which had three trimesters the first time is between a woman and a doctor second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation a third time is between the doctor i mean between the women and the state
that the democratic party actively lied and mislead an entire nation pushing an 81 year old man to the front of the line who is clearly not capable of holding office while stating we are in the midst of the greatest threat to democracy only so they could hold onto power instead of listing to voters
what message biden is unintelligible
when have voters ever liked the policy wonk better than the persona
i hope she runs this year she ’d lock up mi and crush trump
also one 's a convicted felon the other is n't one is a confirmed rapist the other is n't
i do n't know if he is hiding his medical condition how much does he actually respect the democratic process
seriously if dems do n’t replace biden we are screwed no way he ’s winning most people here myself included will vote for him for his cabinet scotus nominees etc but less informed people will not
it made a difference to fence sitters biden gained zero of them
trump is senile too just in a different way he 's the old man who just rants and raves about how the past was better
one has dementia look having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer dr john trump at mit good genes very good genes ok very smart the wharton school of finance very good very smart you know if you ’re a conservative republican if i were a liberal if like ok if i ran as a liberal democrat they would say i 'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it ’s true but when you 're a conservative republican they try oh do they do a number that ’s why i always start off went to wharton was a good student went there went there did this built a fortune you know i have to give my like credentials all the time because we ’re a little disadvantaged but you look at the nuclear deal the thing that really bothers me it would have been so easy and it ’s not as important as these lives are nuclear is so powerful my uncle explained that to me many many years ago the power and that was 35 years ago he would explain the power of what 's going to happen and he was right who would have thought but when you look at what 's going on with the four prisoners now it used to be three now it ’s four but when it was three and even now i would have said it 's all in the messenger fellas and it is fellas because you know they do n't they have n’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men so you know it ’s gon na take them about another 150 years but the persians are great negotiators the iranians are great negotiators so and they they just killed they just killed us this is horrible if only one has dementia it ai n't biden
you 're gon na have to be way more specific than that i 'm not sure which you 're talking about with those descriptions
a malignant narcissist that wo n’t step down from his candidacy when his base begs him to do so
it was really fun being constantly insulted for a year straight by democrats that want my vote for being concerned with biden
i agree trump should have been impeached and barred from office for january 6th
you would take a wide awake fascist over a sleepy effective president
only morons and traitors think so
old as dirt beats corrupt as hell trump is not the better candidate
i 'm voting for the old guy who will appoint at least somewhat competent department heads listens to experts and will not try to turn us into a christo facist state
doing nothing at all actively destroying america
seriously if you want me to wheel his limp body around the white house i ’ll still vote for him 10 10 over trump it ’s ticket vs ticket for me and one side spells doooom
i think you 're pretty much spot on obviously biden 's too old but sitting in his rocking chair he 'd do far less damage than donald pootin i 've considered a write in for sure but you 'd have to be nuts to think dt would be good for the country
the mouth open thing was scarier than it should have been but if he had a cold maybe he could n’t breathe through his nose
wait which one do you think is more significant
biden ’s main bar to clear was not coming across as a corpse
um yes they are say that biden was really slowing down i would still rather have him with the great team he will have around him than trump who just lies and lies and lies and lies some more biden can be replaced and would do what is good for the country if he has to trump would never give up power and has already threatened to run for a third term if he wins a second
not to mention msm doing their damndest not to speak about substance and online trolls are fully engaged the sharks are smelling our blood in the water
we ’ve seen this movie before with nixon ’s debate against kennedy optics are the overwhelming focus for voters in debates every claim that the right has made about biden ’s mental capacity and age was confirmed in the minds of independents we need to run someone else or we will lose
i ’m glad the first guy beat medicaid
what problems is biden gon na solve he ’s not of sound mind the whole country just realized their president is like the loopy grandfather who had to have their driving license taken away this is not an acceptable candidate he is going to lose by a landslide and when he does it all rests on the dnc for allowing this farce to continue
the dnc has shown little to no concern for anything but itself why else would they be gambling the store away on a man that ’s deeply unpopular and showing signs of mental decline i do n’t think the democratic party is even capable of saving democracy they clearly do n’t even believe their own rhetoric
be careful you ’ll be downvoted if you speak too much truth here
does that lie matter as much as the endless lies that trump and his republican cronies have told the whole thing is dirty but there still is n’t any comparison
they did n’t mislead they straight up lied they used the same d day footage of biden wondering around and spun it like he was talking to someone
and you know this how
he picked up independent voters from the latino community
fence sitters anyone who is on the fence and not sure is already voting for trump there 's no one who 's watched trump the last 8 years and is unsure if they 're unsure they already are for him
ai n't nobody reading all of that
what happened on jan 6th
please understand what that word means before you use it
“ corrupt as hell ” my guy you ’re saying you ’re voting for the corrupt one in biden
i ’d happily give up my law career to act as biden ’s puppeteer if that were necessary which it absolutely is not to avoid trump bringing the world to disaster
i 'd totally weekend at bernie 's him if necessary
personally trump ’s lies policies and general behavior are far far worse for the country than an old guy with a stutter with a good cabinet supporting him always got ta clarify with r politics man in terms of impact on undecided voters biden ’s performance with no question
neither nixon now kennedy had terms behind them in fact no debate between two one term presidents has happened in modern times it will not play like others the flaws of both candidates were on display last night if you went in trump or went in biden nothing changed i think undecided voters likely left just as undecided joe was a mess but trump did nothing to assuage any concerns he could have downplayed everything that happened but instead double downed that will not go unnoticed
exactly biden is working to make medicaid work for americans while trump is still trying to figure out which sycophant he 's least scared of over shadowimg him as vp
making thoughtful decisions after listening to a good cabinet and advisors is very different then being able to be quick on your feet and articulate in a debate it ’s totally different types of uses of the mind biden has been a good president for 4 years he ’s not perfect but he ’s as old as trump trump is as incoherent even more incoherent at his rallies and on his truth social posts
what problems is biden gon na solve he ’s not of sound mind well not giving ukraine to putin and inviting an invasion of western europe for starters
polling from 538 even before the debate showed trump up by 1 % in fucking nj
he was n’t really unpopular till last night people definitely had issues but last night holy hell
and i ’m out no longer a democrat i ’m done with having candidates shoved down my throat then told i have to vote for them at least the republicans are afraid to cross their base we have superdelegates to protect those in power from us peace out democracy is toast thanks to a party that ran a senile old man who promised to step aside
i ’m aware i ’m a dem unfortunately in all honesty these people are just as responsible as trump they actively blocked insulted and undermined many voters who had worries and only wanted conversation
which lies are endless though at the very very very least i can pivot and function when republicans lie when dems lie i could be stabbed in the back and many of you would call it propaganda
i agree the floodgates this opened it ’s just wow i even said they lied
ny trial 34 guilty counts of felony charges e jean carroll trial 1 found as matter of fact not up for dispute that trump raped carroll
the convictions are a matter of public record
not the guy you responded to but we know it because both were declared publicly by judges after a trial not hard to find
he was found guilty by a jury of his peers american citizens who were unbiased in either direction and used the factual evidence provided in the trial only to make their determination their determination was guilty
you can get the gist in the first 5 words
glad that touched a nerve with you it ’s trump ’s biggest vulnerability and playing dumb i guess is the new strategy but it wo n’t work
who the fuck is actually undecided at this point it 's a rematch from four years ago and one guy is openly floating the idea that we just wo n't have elections again if he wins
sure thing bud biden needs to be replaced by someone competent
i mean he was objectively unpopular fivethirtyeight has not had his approvals higher than his disapprovals since september 1st 2021 and it 's not getting any better what he was n't necessarily viewed as by a majority of the population prior to last night is senile which is a far larger perception to reverse than unpopular but competent unless joe gets on the talk show circuit with a wildly different affect and does n't stop for the next 4 months that perception is now fixed in the minds of a huge chunk of the country that previously was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt when it came to mental acuity
at least the republicans are afraid to cross their base laughable that 's why they have a convicted felon liable for sexual assault insurrectionist as their candidate definitely because they are n't afraid to cross their base
i 've raised my concerns today and been told i 'm supporting fascism it sucks when the far right rhetoric is correct and anyone on the left starts eating each other in order to deny the plain truth the amount of people telling me i did n't see what i saw last night is concerning we need a real conversation about what is happening or we 're cooked like the biden campaign is
just for example i think trump telling people covid is the same as a cold after he had already told bob woodward that it was incredibly dangerous is a pretty fucked up way to mislead the country which undoubtedly led to more deaths
read that and compare and contrast
probably the bigger issue is unmotivated voters who are not feeling excited at all to take time out of their day to vote for this candidate so we do have to lean into the look how awful the other guy is vote for not having that edit in the future we really do need something inspiring to rally around not only against
point to someone better who is running
objectively of course i understand the points you ’re making polling really means fuck all in the modern age though especially when you consider click bait drives ad revenue everything we “ read ” these days is one step forward two steps back so many orgs are just pandering to a demographic
you ’re 100 % right to feel the way you do you ’re not alone i ’m extremely angry at many people in said party been told the same thing i just really hope this moment opens more people up to conversation not degradation this us vs us shit needs to go
yes and no i ’m a cynical asshole in all honesty i just wanted him to win so i did n’t have to witness another era of the terminally online destroy all the progress that ’s been made in the hopes of monetization the door is heavy and swings both ways
i agree unfortunately fortunately covid is long behind us it means nothing more
yes let 's both do that
one thing that still fucking flaberghasts me is how citizens of your country are not automatically by filing a tax return registered to vote yeah i get that some people filing a tax return might not be a citizen but that should be a part of filing it and how voting is handled in canada if election day falls on a work day employers are required to every employee who is an elector is entitled during voting hours on polling day to have three consecutive hours for the purpose of casting his or her vote and if his or her hours of work do not allow for those three consecutive hours his or her employer shall allow the time for voting that is necessary to provide those three consecutive hours
get excited about a supreme court that wo n’t keep fucking you over for the next 40 years excited yet
this is what i 'm terrified of
for a lot of people that ’s trump this is why we ’re worried
probably means a lot to people with dead loved ones another example of their lies how about brett kavanaugh and amy coney barrett saying roe v wade was settled law before their confirmation right before they turned around and gutted it and here ’s not a lie but typical shady republican bullshit when mcconnell would n’t confirm obama ’s supreme court justice appointment because it was an election year then fast tracking an rbg replacement for trump two weeks before an election
guess it 's all by design to make it harder for us
exactly it ’s a shitty sequel nobody asked for
stop with that rbg lie obama actively asked her to step down she decided to completely tarnish her legacy and jeopardized all the women she claimed to represent rbg was wrong
i did n’t lie at all about rbg and we ’re talking about mcconnell being full of shit keep up
and he is i 100 % agree i ’m just tired of this conversation and making excuses for the flaccid dem party
in today ’s america this incident along with having villain eyebrows will probably help get her elected
simonetti the runner up in the summer ’s special election in the nonpartisan hennepin county board race running as a conservative has dealt with some other legal trouble in the past she faced allegations of credit card fraud after being accused of creating 80 000 of charges on her ex fiance ’s card but the case was dropped after her former partner settled in civil court according to kare simonetti and another ex boyfriend also have restraining orders against each other kare also reported serious michele bachmann vibes from this one
it ’s always in the eyes
i have never seen a face that looks more like the face of someone who would throw a tarantula at a person
is the tarantula okay though
simonetti said if i ’m scared or hurt i try and make jokes get better material
80k credit card limit damn a successful guy was about to marry a gold digging nutcase all she had to do was wait until the wedding but she could n't stop from thieving
if the convicted felon wins there is going to be an ultimate show down between the criminal president and the out of control conservative majority sc they will both think they are god king ruler s for life but sooner or later one will betray the other
moral decency and keeping clean underwear are also problems for trump
my response to the double haters is that i 'm a single issue voter that issue is scotus what were voting for is a say in lifetime appointments
i thought it was more like an attempted coup not obstruction yelling kill mike pence is not really obstructionist talk edit all while storming the capitol building
are we doing this for ferguson or minneapolis or baltimore just curious
interesting battle there the supreme court that does n’t respect precedence versus the president that does n’t respect law it ’s bad versus evil
this is what i said 8 years ago during trump v clinton it ’s not hillary you ’re voting for it ’s the supreme court no one listened
exactly 1 or 2 scotus members could be replaced or kick the bucket in the next four years clarence thomas 75 samuel alito 74 might be food for thought in anyone 's 2024 vote new justices tend to rule for several decades compared to a 4 year presidential term
were those cities certifying the results of a presidential election per the constitutional process no sadly race riots have a long history in the us while coup attempts have not or at least not until trump if you defend jan 6 insurrectionists you support mob rule and yes any rioters from those cities who broke the law deserve to be arrested and have their day in court too just like the jan 6 insurrectionists it called rule of law ’ and dictator for a day trump believes he ’s above the law and uses the constitution for toilet paper
those who knew were watching and dreading
insurrectionists to take over the most powerful country in the history of humanity so they must have had lots of automatic weapons artillery even aircraft right surely not just a drunken mob waving flags right
just so goddamn disingenuous to actual coups and insurrections to call j6 an insurrection
actually calling j6 an insurrection is like the apex of white privilege
it was the deal maker that forced me to vote for hillary rather than abstaining as my vote because both candidates were awful
if you want to get people moving you have to make them real mad you have to make them scared
if the only thing you ’ve been told about jan 6th was that it was a 7th grade class field trip then i could see how you ’d think that try educating yourself watch the select committee hearings you know where the testimony is under oath unlike faux news who had to pay nearly a billion dollars for their nonstop lying wake up man
tbh if the election gets stolen again in 24 i hope 45 shows y’ all a real insurrection
fits right in with the trump regime perfect vp pic
folks i do n’t walk as easy as i used to i do n’t speak as smoothly as i used to i do n’t debate as well as i used to but i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong and i know how to do this job i know like millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up this is what the world needs to hear it 's still a clear choice if you believe that we the people are more than two sides in a fight
was a poor performance yes do i wish we were in a different situation yes but here 's my takeaway from this at least joe biden can admit it he wo n't blame anyone else he wo n't blame the moderators or the new rules or anything else he wo n't claim no one debates better than him he can admit when he failed and try to do better next time in an era where lies are spewed faster and more abundantly than can be fact checked having someone with honesty humility and integrity is more important than ever
where the fuck was this guy last night
he spoke much much better at the rally than he did at the debate if only it had been the other way around
i 'll vote for the biden administration not the trump crime syndicate thanks
holy shit he sounded incredible today more aggressive and clear than he was even 4 years ago this needs to make the news cycle i honestly do n’t understand why he was n’t this fired up last night it ’s like he was poisoned or something sure he had a teleprompter today but he delivered it clearly and with passion if he came out like this in the debate we ’d all be saying the election is over and biden is headed for a record breaking win
538 ipsos poll finds basically no change pre and post debate so put that in your discourse pipe and smoke it still got ta wait for more data to flesh out the picture for biden moving forward
wow it 's a whole new biden loud energetic and coherent and i 'm happy to see a large energetic crowd turn out for him in my home state i guess joe 's a morning person no more public speaking after 5 pm lol
this was much worse performance than even obama and his first debate against romney
debate performance matters much more than rally performance
okay so joe can have a good day that ’s not what we need at this point we need someone who ’s on top of their game all the time and will have the energy and stamina to be an effective candidate it feels crazy to me to have a tottering candidate be the only thing standing between trump and the presidency also a younger candidate wo n’t have any of the liabilities associated with the biden administration afghanistan inflation immigration etc even if most of these things are n’t true
it is not sensible to run an unpopular candidate against a charismatic but unqualified candidate
the fact that there is this much disparity between when he is reading off a teleprompter vs having to answer questions and use cognitive ability is quite telling
there ’s no going back the entire country watched last night anybody in this sub is politically active undecided voters and people just tuning in they watched the debate and saw the disaster there ’s no other way to spin it edit oh cool i see this is being downvoted also either there ’s an active botting campaign going on in this sub trying to gaslight people or some of you really really really really need to wake the fuck up before it ’s too late
he did n't want to bungle or bopple the fingal doppel at the raleigh rally
the debate proved biden is old yeah we knew that let ’s stop pretending to be surprised he ’s been old this whole time
electors and the house will do what they can to keep biden out regardless this is the final year of democracy as we know it
for those in team biden how concerned are you about jill stein being on the ballot in all the key swing states in 2024 if you recall in the 2020 election where stein was not on the ballot biden barely edged out trump in the swing states of az ga and wi by margins of only around 10 000 allowing biden to get his needed 270 electoral votes that s a margin of less than 0 5 % in many cases looking back at the 2016 presidential election the one that trump won jill stein was on the ballot and would regularly score tallies of 50 000 far exceeding the margin in which trump beat hillary by in numerous battleground states jill stein has policies to the left of joe biden so we know who she takes votes from it ai nt trump stein did n’t run in 2020 but she is running now in 2024 and consistently polls at around 2 % for the national average her presence is even stronger in swing states michigan and wisconsin where they have a humungous arab muslim population traditionally democrat but very unhappy with biden ’s handling of israel palestine she can easily scoop up 80 000 democrat votes in those ultra tight swing state races against trump looking at her past performance and current vitality and energized base d t palestine war a war not going on in 2016 a swing state that is to be decided by less than 10 000 votes in biden ’s favor can now easily swing in full force towards trumps column of electoral votes and tank biden ’s chances of another term trump only needs to pick up one state of the democrat “ great blue wall ” mn wi mi pa va nh maine in order to clobber joe and get to 270 if he flipped az and ga red current polling suggests he will you can easily see jill stein as a powerful spoiler to joes vote tallies in critical swing states and her actions alone can throw those states red and re elect donald trump add to the fact that biden had an approval rating of 56 % disapproval of 34 % back in november 2020 now these numbers have swapped places take the reciprocal of approval to disapproval in 2020 and you have joe ’s current rating now in 2024 trump ’s have remained merely the same jill stein 2024 seems to have blown a massive hole into the hull of the biden 2024 ship and water is now rushing in at an unstoppable rate like the titanic joe hit a jill stein ice berg so to speak but what do you guys think do you agree
folks i do n’t walk as easy as i used to i do n’t speak as smoothly as i used to i do n’t debate as well as i used to but i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong and i know how to do this job he told the roaring crowd i know like millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up if he 's lost his way with debates with the likes of trump and his speech is in decline people expect him to stand up against people like putin and xi
they must of pumped him full drugs
exactly trump lies biden does not easy choice if you are n't a fascist racist piece of fucking shit
that should have been his closing last night
it ’s good to see him address it instead of sweep it under the rug the problem is a good rally does n’t make up for a bad debate everyone there is already supporting him and he ’s in control of the narrative there ’s no pressure it ’s not an accurate representation of his ability to do what is arguably the most stressful job in the world the biden at the debate was biden under pressure and it was n’t a good look
the world needs to hear that the democratic candidate is sharp and clear headed this is n’t a good look will i vote for him if i have to obviously but i ’d prefer to vote for someone who was born well after the roosevelt administration
after biden performed so badly in a nationally televised debate that the new york times is calling for him to its difficult to find solace in the fact that he was on point at a rally in front of an audience that was already going to vote for him
where was this biden yesterday
the damage is done and the jig is up none of this matters
one thing i stated pretty much right away is biden needed a solid couple months of prep work because democrats did not do debates all the practice and refinement work did n't happen biden went in cold and it was a mess trump has the luxury of being a professional bser he does this stuff every single day biden has no such luxury and if he wanted to be serious about this he really needed to work for it the short of it all is he failed he did not put in the work needed to bring an a game he brought a d game and that was with charity the only way this gets better is with more debates i just do n't know if it will ever happen the best thing republicans can do is not offer any more debates trump will never get better he can only spew the same content biden will get better and he can actually refine his talking points more is the only way it works for biden i just do n't know what anyone will do i do n't know if trump would let his ego drive him into another debate i do n't know if republicans will allow it i do n't know if democrats would allow it i do n't know if media companies care enough to to allow it there is high likelihood that this was biden 's only chance
regardless a world leader should n’t be shambling around having difficulty expressing coherent thoughts as the president you are responsible for over 330 million people ’ lives and wellbeing and the effects of your presidency are going to be felt long after you are gone those people deserve the best of the best and if you are n’t there anymore you frankly do n’t deserve the position that goes for both candidates the american population deserves and should demand better
here ’s the full speech
if he does n’t walk and speak well he should retire from one of the most stressful jobs in the world
sounds to me like he ’s too fucking prideful to do the right thing and drop out of the race at the upcoming convention and let somebody who ’s brain is n’t the same consistency as a rotten egg take a run for the presidency and actually be able to take down trump trump is leading in the polls he ’s a giant threat to democracy i used to be a biden supporter but now it seems that biden is more concerned about getting a second term than he is about the future this country this is not the only way and this is not the way this is ridiculous this country is literally about to be ripped in half by the ego and self delusion of two demented old men
to the speech writer nice line this is teleprompter joe you ca n’t be this blind to think he is all there anymore
this is such copium biden looks weak those clips of him stuttering like he has dementia will haunt him for the rest of his political career being honest about being old is n’t a virtue unless you ’re willing to hang it up what happens when the nation is under a crisis does joe biden need a nap to make a decision trump sucks but he exposed how old joes condition is
this is the takeaway that so many other commenters are completely missing
if you own it they ca n’t hurt you with it
if he can actually admit it to himself he can legitimately drop out at the upcoming convention he ’s just another typical politician at this point to me he ’s allowing the country to be torn apart by not allowing someone who could actually defeat trump to jump in all because he does n’t wanna be a one termer the honorable thing would be to let democracy decide who takes a run at the presidency on behalf of the democratic party at the upcoming convention and take down trump the right way this is n’t over we do n’t have to hang our hands up and surrender we can put the pressure on biden he needs to walk away he does n’t need blind support
it was n't ' poor ' it was historically disastrous i 'm a registered democrat and i 'm voting for him but you cope sucking weirdos need to wake the fuck up he is n't winning
fighting off a cold and very over prepared also choosing the left podium was bad he likes to look at the moderators and because the angle from the camera shot it looks like he ’s looking into the great beyond when he ’s not
biden looked so different at the waffle house later and the rally today because he is sputtering not stuttering no one dealing with alzheimer ’s just wakes up one day with a fully developed case it comes in stages
biden can work a crowd
he was stunned last night having to listen to the maniac opposite him he got thrown off his groove i think being in the same room with trumpf does that to a lot of people
he sounded much better than last night but in absolute terms okay at best
but he did n’t come out last night it just shows that when he has to think he fails and needs a teleprompter to tell him what to say
538 wrote an article where they showed how the difference materializes about 2 weeks after so i 'm skeptical
that 's not true though it showed biden 's share of likely voters dropping 1 5 % i would n't call that basically no change when this election is going to be won by a few percentage points
it ’s gon na take a week or two for that to really reflect in polling not everyone pays attention as closely
polls on average are a weekish behind any specific news event i would give it a week
i 'm definitely interested in following the polls to see if this was catastrophic or not do you have a link to that one it was an opportunity to run away with it that was entirely fumbled by him i 'm crushed because i 'm a big biden fan but the dude is too old i 'm confident in his administration but i 'm not confident in his electability if that makes sense
you have n’t given enough time for the smell to fully settle in this is going to hurt a lot they ’ve got ample clips of a vacant and feeble biden
having to praise a president for being coherent is so funny
yeah and look how that turned out
fuck john stamos is part of maga mercy
president sanders and his record breaking rally attendance beg to differ
i 'm not sure charismatic is the word to go with
vote blue no matter who
wake the fuck up before it ’s too late oh i 'm awake and definitely not voting for trump
people here do n’t care too much for the truth biden ’s performance was unjustifiable and a massive disappointment
any jill stein hole is covered up by dead older voters democrats have won every election since the jan 6 attempt defying the polls there is an undercounted silent wave and its not old voters that are maxed out and dying
nope virtually no one knows who she is this year
are you talking about russian asset jill stein who was used awarely or unawarely to help get trump elected in 2016 sounds like you 're pushing the same playbook
good news i do n't think stein and the green party have the kind of moment that they did in 2016 nor does the libertarians bad news rfk jr does have some momentum but who knows how that will play out on election day if he 'll even be on the ballot in all states and which candidate he 's going to take the most votes from sadly i think biden but the number of voters he pulls from trump probably wo n't be much smaller i think biden should just gracefully bow out and let someone else take a shot it may have been an off performance due to the lingering effects of a cold but millions of viewers saw that performance and millions more will see the sometimes selectively edited clips and there 's just no coming back from it the democrats could easily make any candidate a household name by november and the polling shows that voters want a choice other than trump or biden just the fact that they would be willing to listen to voters and offer them someone else might even give them a boost the debate hurt biden more than it helped trump trump is still deeply unpopular and his win is considered the better performance but they were both awful
why do i keep seeing people repeat this nonsense as if world leaders get in a room with their adversaries and have a verbal joust mano e mano that is n't how it works walking softly and carrying a big stick is better than loud bluster
stand up to putin and xi biden is currently standing up to putin and xi whereas we all know trumpy boy will wag his hair bark turn around and offer up his butt to either so long as they say “ you ’re the best boy ” afterwards
you are aware that most molestation is performed by someone related to or knows the victim right biden was speaking to this meanwhile trump was running around sexually assaulting people and as much as you guys like to avoid it trump was a good friend of epstein so
it was literally about women who are raped and forced to carry their rape baby to term because of republican policy what 's really sick is n't biden calling that out it 's republicans who celebrate the gift of life through a fucking rape
it 's true partner violence is the 1 cause of that just like it 's the families who molest most not often drag queens do nt even rank on the list though pastors do
the diary was verified as belonging to ashley biden but the story was published in the extreme right wing blog national file in october 2020 conveniently just one month ahead of the u s presidential election and when the national file finally released a purported pdf of the document the supposed damming dairy entry was nowhere to be found in its 112 pages which was why no legitimate news source went with the story
and here in the real world
biden was trying to dispel the myth that rape is because of “ the immigrants ” what trump pushes saying that it is often due to the people closest to them he ’s also saying that bans on abortion will put these types of victims at great risk i think it was a horrible point for biden to make as it can so easily be misconstrued and biden was messing up talking points left and right
i ’m glad i ’m not the only one who gets pissed off about the insanity on the right
biden lied a fuck ton last night did you look at the fact checking we need someone else to be the democratic nominee
hindsight is 40 20 thanks to presbyopia
he had better writers tonight
agreed “ folks i ’m slower and weaker than i used to be but i swear i ’m still strong enough to run the us ” is not a good look
trump did not do any debates this cycle either
a world leader should n’t be a convicted felon rapist fraudster pathological liar who surrounds himself with psychopaths and sycophants even if biden is n’t the best right now at least his cabinet is
yeah because if we learned one thing in the 30s and 40s it ’s how important walking is to being an effective president oh wait
do you think he 's the only member of the executive branch i 'd take the biden administration any day over stephen miller and other bigots
you believe trump has anyone 's interests at heart besides his own
this is n’t a children ’s film they can definitely hurt joe biden if they convince everyone in the swing states joe is demented
are you twelve yes he can
also choosing the left podium was bad they stated in the debate that positioning was based on a coin toss but yes i agree that a lot of people misinterpret him as staring off into nothing when he was probably just looking at the moderators
lol looking into the great beyond
i m really sick of the ' cold ' line if the cold was that bad he better get back to that cramped waffle house and apologize and check on the sick day policy of all the workers and custoners he was all up in their space post debate sick people ought not do that rude or a liar neither is great
biden can read a script
i really think so too he seems to almost put a spell on people that makes them swoon or cower i ca n’t stand him but you ca n’t deny his ability to get what he wants
he spoke first and it immediately was not going well
biden acting stunned was one of my greatest disappointments of the debate consider 50 % of the event had microphone time for trump where any reasonable person would anticipate trump using it to lie and for a camera to be also filming biden 's reactions while listening his team had all the reason to expect trump 's behavior at the debate at this point who is honestly surprised at trump 's constant lying at best biden was acting surprised because he and his team thought that was the best approach if he was honestly stunned then they are hopelessly unprepared for this campaign biden could have used body language to better gesture and dismiss the lies in the moment the acting stunned provided comedians and the media with an hour of film showing biden with a slacked jaw looking lost not good i agree it does n't seem easy fielding responses to both the moderators and trump 's bile but phew that is the position he and his team are in unfortunately for us all they did not do better
so how will biden fair when he has to talk to other world leaders that also shady
if that ’s true that ’s scary to think he ’s in rooms with plenty of other maniacal world leaders and strong personalities and expected to hold his own on our behalves
yeah but think about obama without a teleprompter he would speak so slowly and think about his answer give him a teleprompter and he was on fire
republicans have their convention in 2 weeks though and that usually gives a polling bump likewise democrats have theirs a few weeks after that
why would it take two weeks i ’m not a polling expert but that makes no fucking sense only 48 million watched last night down from 78 million in 2020 and the debates did nt move the needle back then so i ’m insanely skeptical of this claim
this was a poll of debate watchers
and it 's going to be a blip on the radar if at all
here you go basically people thought trump “ won ” but it did n’t change anyone ’s mind
remeber there are plenty of interested parties who are trying to spin everything those parties back both sides of any debate but not concensus with out which democracy can not fuction
more people will have watched last nights debate performance than the rally
he is charismatic to his target audience that sounds facetious but it 's true his gruff assholism lack of understanding of complex words lack of turns of phrase etc they 're all boons to him when speaking to republicans
it is the only quality of a demagogue
he ’s an abject moron and i ’ll vote for biden no matter what but he ’s objectively charismatic and can riff lol
great now imagine if the democrats have a decent candidate do n’t you think it would be a blowout are n’t you worried about down the ballot or undecided voters in swing states why risk it when so much is at stake
gee it 's almost like the fact that republicans are dying to covid more than democrats is fucking with the population data from the census stupid is as stupid does should n't have made getting a live saving vaccine a political issue but here we are
even if true it does n’t change the fact that stein could well be a spoiler candidate again
i remember when just lie back and enjoy it was enough to derail a political career
fact checking was biased against biden
yeah not sure how much credit you can give to a scripted response vs a live debate apparently enough though for some who ca n’t admit the truth
there are people who are just as qualified for the job as he is that are n’t suffering from age related decline
true but all he does is talk being in front of a camera bsing is his favorite hobby he does n't need practice for this he just does this all the time all he needs to do is show up and he 's on fire the content is gibberish and of no practical use but he 's good at it because he does it all the time biden does not one thing i realized after seeing biden 's rally just after was biden was using his rally content at the debate it seemed like he did work practicing the rally and did n't really prep for the actual debate he pulled a lot of the same phrases and tidbits from the rally speech and trying to shove them into a debate response he did this a lot which unfortunately made the debate flow really weird he was n't really rallying he was remembering bits and reusing which made it pretty funky no teleprompter no order trying to tape random pieces of a speech together as debate responses that was a bad bad approach he should have just debated and stopped trying to pull out random numbers and phrases from an upcoming speech this is n't an excuse for him biden did horrid but the way he approached the debate was a really bad play and it 's something that wo n't feel organic without a lot of practice a good debate is in part a hundred elevator speeches super polished that you can rely on and a debate is listening and reacting smartly with fitting counters you could always see trump doing this he listened well he took key parts and his rebuttal was focused on those keys his responses were autopilot the same content he 's said over and over and over a thousand times again those elevator speeches things that you can rely on naturally at whim biden was not in the mode not in the moment and was n't listening he was n't prepared and was n't in the moment doing the work he needed to do at only a few moments biden actually listened reacted but he had nothing polished he only had his prepared speech and the content coming out was exceptionally crude no polish lacking coherence it was garbage this is why time and practice is required this is in part what early debates do for a candidate they run through these cycles a half dozen times they build their elevator speeches they practice they make the talking points smooth here 's a hypothesis if haley debated trump directly the same way as biden haley would have smashed trump in the debate the republican party had a bunch of debates they got practice and haley was getting competitive while trump is good at the talk he lacks all substance so if you pair him against someone else who is good at the talk he has nothing to fall back onto an unprepared biden was the best opponent trump could have gotten haley became competitive against trump she was n't just starting to win rallies she was starting to get good at those elevator speeches she was accruing enough experience to stomp trump and then the party pulled her out this only works right now because trump is going against biden as biden is right now but do two more debates in the next couple months then see how this shifts again this is purely a hypothesis but experience only makes biden better the single best thing biden can do is more debates the single best thing trump can do is no more debates going back to biden 's rally speech after the debate i do suggest watching it when i reference that above it makes a lot more sense when you watch the rally looking backwards biden 's debate was 80 % the rally speech but shoved through a woodchipper no order no teleprompter and random bits glued back together in pieces watch the rally and then look back on the debate there was a lot of verbatim content phrases
yeah that ’s everyone ’s concern biden ’s walking it ’s not the fact he was borderline comatose last night and appeared to be on death ’s door
so the candidate does n’t matter as long as they ’re dem not a very effective defense for joe
yes respect your new president
did n't he choose that podium though
both are true biden won the coin toss and so got to pick the podium
also from what i can tell news of the cold broke mid debate and came from his campaign correct me if i 'm wrong please not only does it make me skeptical that he had a cold but it just seems dumb to not say that first to set expectations imagine how much better received his first raspy words would have been if everybody knew he was ill
i was thinking the same thing trump had covid at their last debate and did n’t fold like biden did and i ’m a biden supporter
i mean i know not towing company line is worth a downvote it 's not like that matters but really the downvters argument is that someone so sick they ca n't talk or think clearly shuld be glad handling strangers at a waffle house cultists on all sides it seems
and trump ca n't stick to one i 'd rather have somebody who writs out their words and reads a prepared statement while being able to deliver the message they intended to than a bunch of word salad from a guy who calls the the digital and the electric and goes into random praise of fictitious serial killers being able to deliver a clear concise message is important maybe had biden done that last night we 'd have been better off but ca n't change the past can only move forward
what he s been doing for 4 years and 8 years before that its being diplomatic
diplomacy is n't like a televised debate
i feel like i m in lala land did we see the same debate i do nt think there are any parallels in american history this was n’t like talking too slowly or too quickly or sweaty or sighing when his opponent talked and again i ’m someone who thinks he s had good legislative achievements and is a decent man how do you think people who do nt know what the inflation reduction or chips act is perceive this
not to mention trump has an appointment in nyc in that same timeframe where some news might possibly happen
you can read for yourself
only 43million watched the debate in full most people will make their opinions made on small clips they see online unfortunately
as expected the vast majority of people already had their mind pretty well made up before the debate biden is n't cooked yet but i will say that i wish democrats stopped putting up candidates like this that keep everything riding on a knife 's edge there were far better candidates to be honest i have been a fan of biden 's administration and the work they 've done and i 'll be voting for him again come november but it never should 've been close trump 's performance criminal activity and lack of brainpower should 've been something that democrats absolutely slam dunked on instead we 're left wondering if there 's even a path to victory which for the record i think there is
and as the years have gone by this target audience has grown and grown americans are becoming coarser less trusting and more selfish altogether more receptive to trump 's style and message
the silent generation is almost all gone and they voted for trump 52 to 43
i am sorry are you going to ressurrect all those older voters that trend trump and died
there ’s still something to be said for good presentation though which is what he woefully lacked last night
which person would you be referring to because there ’s only 2 other living former 1 term presidents
as much as he respects his buddy putin or maybe his buddy epstein
i do n’t respect a rapist who has been convicted of 34 felonies for lying about money that he gave to a porn star so he could have sex with her while his wife was pregnant with his child
yes he did they won that coin toss and got first choice
right both things are going on at once but only the covid death discrepancy is not accounted for by the census population data that pollsters are using polls have been off by a rather significant margin for a few years now judging by actual election data
serving one term is not a pre requisite for being president and does n’t necessarily make someone more qualified for the job gestures toward trump there are several governors and senators who i think would fit the bill
yes i prematurely celebrated texas which polled correctly but yeah i am seeing a ton of 2 3 4 point swings from where polls predict considering they cull so much data rv lv a they are screwing up big time
how can you argue someone with no experience on a job is equally qualified for the job
yeah i do n't read breitbart
experience is a double edge sword on one hand you have perspective because you ’ve dealt with similar things before on the other you have blinders because you believe you know from experience the world is ever changing and a past solution may not fit current needs sometimes what is required is a fresh perspective that has n’t been tainted by the years of the past
ok so let ’s give it back to trump instead of a democrat who has n’t been president before since he ’s the one with the experience makes sense
no i ’m not saying that there are plenty of capable candidates i for one would love to see whitmer but qualified how can you argue against previous experience
if the guy with previous experience is suffering from obvious cognitive decline pretty easily
i guess if you wanna be pedantic about it i ’m mostly just tired of being lorded over by fossils
republicans totally buying it upon seeing a veteran with 13 fingers and 3 metal legs riding a motorcycle in africa that ’s made out of empty soda bottles while jesus runs with a football “ why do n’t people share most posts like this ”
democrats up until the debate totally buying the articles stating biden is a “ dynamo ” behind closed doors and that any criticisms towards biden are inherently ableist and pushing for a trump victory
the only trump at the side of good i approve
for those like me who had n't heard of the phrase spin room before it turns out that 's an actual location a spin room also known as spin row or spin alley is an area in which reporters can speak with debate participants and or their representatives after a debate the name refers to the fact that the participants will attempt to spin or influence the perception of the debate among the assembled reporters the benefit for reporters is that they quickly get in person interviews with debaters or their representatives complete with audio video and photos for a u s presidential debate the number of reporters in the spin room can number into the thousands makes sense
nice to know they have a spin room these hacks better start justifying whatever salary they are drawing because there are still 2 debates to go never thought that one day i would rally behind spin doctors
family knows you best and if they think you 're a shithead well it 's like gossar 's or rfk 's family they do n't want to be in the public eye but if you think your own family member is trouble you should speak out good for her
i get why she was considered a good ' get ' in left leaning media she 's a close trump relative openly bashing trump but she 's also a one trick pony and i 'm sick of seeing her
mary trump is a con artist just like her uncle
donald did n’t give her as much as she wanted from fred trump sr donald ’s dad estate it was a legal battle family court can get fucking ugly i would take anything she says with a high level of skepticism
she ’s a grifter just like the rest of the family
there 's also fred jr too
she has n’t interacted with trump in two decades she does n’t know any more about trump than we do this is all for clout
i ’m getting tired boss what could she possibly say that ’s worse than the things we ’re having trials about what could anyone say like if a tape came out tomorrow of trump in a baphomet mask molesting an orphan while strangling a puppy would he even lose a single vote
yeah she 's the untrustworthy trump sure buddy
people do n't seem to know she 's been selling books off of all this
if only there was some way to view trump remotely on some rectangular screen or something but alas the technology is n't there yet
she already released a book in 2020 and has another one i guess it obviously said jack shit or else it would be a bigger story in the news
so in a legal battle you think one person is a total piece of shit and the other is always 100 % truthful
i m surprised she has n’t been sued
so she does n’t know anything about him got it
yeah like i do n’t think this is worth the trouble of trying to undermine she ’s just gon na be like “ my uncle who has been convicted and charged with multiple crimes is a bad person ” and everyone even a lot of rs who will still vote for him will just be like “ we know ”
well one is a total piece of shit a lifelong crook and con man a rapist and a convicted felon who told over 30 000 lies in just the 4 years he was president the other is mary trump
yes trump 's niece knows nothing about her uncle her brain is unable to store longterm information is the whole problem you 've nailed it
she ’s a grifter like the rest of them she ’s going to give us insight into someone she has n’t seen since trump was in his 40s lol okay
she 's a noted psychologist she 's an expert in her field trump tried to kill his own vice president i do n't think he 's that hard to diagnose it 's an easy layup edit lololmaopimp err derrr err derr err derr trump 's brother was an airplane pilot who tried to distance himself from the family maybe not perfect but a way better person than donald trump
i mean i guess she ’s got books to sell right edit lol she was married to his brother who died of alcoholism and sued him for cutting her out of the will sounds like she ’s very impartial
yeah writing books is somehow a problem donald trump sells books why are you giving him a pass
the point is simple she ’s not doing this out of the goodness of her heart she ’s doing this because she has a personal grudge and is trying to profit off him she ’s a leech
“ i ’ve never seen anybody like this guy ” donald trump huffed in thursday ’s debate against president joe biden “ everything he does is a lie ” that 's rich coming from a man who spent the entire debate spewing lie after lie it 's always projection with trump and his allies i think the biggest lie told in the debate which is n't even in this article is when trump unironically claimed that the problem have is they 're radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month the ninth month and even after birth after birth excuse me after birth abortions it 's republicans not democrats who would rather tell mothers they 're all on their own after giving birth leading to higher infant mortality rates
too late cnn let it slide everyone let ’s trump slide
what cnn should have been doing
does anybody know what trump was referring to and claiming that there is something like “ 19 witnesses ” denying that trump ever called soldiers suckers are losers of course my default expectation is that its bogus but i ’m just curious what he was even trying to get at
already but there were so many that was fast
he figured out long ago that it does n’t matter how obvious the lie is because his base does not care if what he says is true or not if it makes the people they hate angry they ’re all for it
he lies so often it 's hard to fact check him
what everyone seems to be failing to realize is that trump ’s devotees simply do n’t care if he lies you could have live fact checking during the debate with scanable at codes on the tv screen and either 1 no one would bother or 2 they ’d call them lies
i sure ca n’t wait for the article i ’m sure they will write on biden ’s lies
i was frustrated hearing this it was so easy biden glossed over it about 6 weeks but needed to really hammer home republicans are preventing abortions before anyone knows they ’re pregnant and risking lives for every pregnant woman for political points with religious minority groups biden ’s ineffective communication prevented any solid rebuttal and counter
i have never and would never vote for trump but to pretend like the proverbial tsunami of lies we all were up to our tips in last night only came from trump is an exceedingly myopic take suggesting that a politician who just showed the entire world he is clearly in no condition to even pretend to be the man responsible for the most influential countries policy decisions at a period in time that feels very critical to the future viability to and faith in the neo liberal geopolitical apparatus on a global scale the damage that could result from forcing voters to elect a man who is very clearly senile and struggles mightily to remain focused and coherent in a single sentence it 's obvious to everyone with any objectivity that while trump is a pathological liar like most politicians he is able to form a cogent argument and does n't rely on memorized rehearsed responses to softball questions what a sad sad time this is for our country
they always do we know what trump does and no one ever actually prepares for him or hold him accountable he gets away with everything when it ’s so easy to put him in his place but no one ever does
just his classic many people are saying schtick with a number attached to make it sound quantitative real
i was so hoping the moderators or biden would ask trump to name just 1 of those 19 maybe the media can try asking him but they 're too buy reporting on democratic infighting
it 's not even his base the media does n't care if trump lies because they expect it of him
because trump ’s base is used to his whining
lol they both lie quit acting like ones better then the other they do n’t give two shits about the working man shit biden has been on record for years about how he has lied and made up shit ffs he had to drop out of his first race for plagiarism
and the debate moderators and organizers should have been ready we know it was coming but they allowed it without a hint of resistance
imagine voting for biden imagine voting for a convicted felon who is guilty of rape a pathological liar and an unabated racist i actually can not imagine that because i am not a dumb ass who would vote for the jack ass
what lies did biden say i missed that part
i ’m not a democrat and have a lot of problems with biden but i would vote for a block of wood carved to look like biden over trump it is mindblowing that after j6 he ’s even allowed to run again that was a dealbreaker
elect a man who is very clearly senile and struggles mightily to remain focused and coherent in a single sentence did you watch his speech after the debate last night or his speech at the rally in nc today if so tell us which parts of either of those were clearly senile or incoherent they 're short we can wait while you watch and the respond
19 people said they “ did n’t hear him say that ” but they did n’t “ deny he said it ” big difference between the two
both sides are the same fuck off with that bullshit they are not and never have been
as i said i do n’t like biden though at this point it ’s hard to tell if he ’s intentionally lying vs just confused but just as trump “ could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody ” and not lose voters i am the flip side of trump voters who do n’t care if he lies or is competent biden literally could ’ve had a stroke and shit himself in that debate and i ’d still vote for him
exactly they had 8 years to learn how to fact check trump and keep him on the question that was asked 8 years and cnn still completely failed to even do the most basic of what a moderator should do it was n't by accident otherwise there would have been an attempt to do it they never even tried
to scared of course you are
here 's a few 1 no soldiers dying during his term 2 the border patrol supporting his policies 3 saying trump ordered people to inject bleach as a protective measure against covid 4 saying insulin was 15 a shot among
is the debate the only thing from him that you ’ve watched in the past four years if so there ’s a lot more you can see where he is clearly senile
lol your right both side are not one side has the whole media lying to us the last 3 years saying this fuck is mentally stable to run the us but ca n’t figure out how to walk down a flight of stairs biden is just as crooked as trump do some fucking research bud
he has been several times he 's also gone to trial and was convicted by a jury and he will be sentenced on july 11 will he be arrested again likely
yeah he withdrew from a 20 yr war that trump kept in place i live in texas and yeah the bp all supported biden ’s plan that trump blocked gtfo “ the infamous bleach press conference ” insulin 35 he corrected himself on the spot
do your research dude your a walking gold mine of maga bullshit biden has given tons of interviews on tv state of the union speeches visited countless foreign country diplomats and givin speeches he sucked last night he has already acknowledge it and moved on he is no where close to being corrupt
these guys are n’t worth the argument bud world leaders watched biden shit the bed and know he ’s weak and incapable they want four more years of that the usa is a target after that performance
they 're talking about trump 's rape case which was decided in civil court and not criminal court but still so saying trump is guilty of sexual abuse is a true statement
he withdrew from that war in the war worst way possible and regardless how you feel about the issue americans did die and they died on his watch contrary to what he said so yes it is a lie and then when they were honoring those soldiers he was observed by the families constantly checking his watch the only reason he did n’t tell more lies i can only assume is because he could barely speak to begin with
i swear the only people that say “ do your research ” are people who have never performed any actual research beyond what they heard on social media
lmao i ’m not saying trump should win my guy i am saying this fucking guy has lost his marbles
in a sense i ’d say you ’re right i am not going to change my mind no matter what you say but my point was that neither would trumpers if trump appeared incoherent rather than just a fountain of obvious lies how many trumpers would ever see that scenario happen and say “ jeez he ’s really slipping i guess i ’ll vote for biden ” the answer is zero but somehow if the other side does it and points to his very real shortcomings trumpers switch to their no you are grade school debate rules and act like their candidate has n’t demonstrated his idiocy for 8 straight years this comes from someone who would happily vote for haley romney or any other center right candidates over biden it ’s not that i like the dems i am not a fan my problem is that trump has obliterated what we all would ’ve called conservatism 10 years ago and replaced it with a cult that worships stupidity
the judge in the carroll said the sa amounted to rape as we commonly know it just not to the letter of the law close enough to call him a rapist i think the judge said the verdict did not mean that carroll “ failed to prove that mr trump raped ’ her as many people commonly understand the word rape ’ indeed the jury found that mr trump in fact did exactly that ”
the convicted felon part is what i was replying to edit but i get your point and thanks for the link adds to the point
cult that worships stupidity my god did the world just not see biden show his stupidity and incoherence on a global broadcast and you have people saying “ biden is the guy i want with nuclear codes ” listen bud you vote for whoever you want but for every “ no u ” statement you can blame magas for 1001 other examples from the liberal side can be thrown in there too americans are easily swayed if the last 10 years has shown me anything for me it ’s trump 2024 baby make my wallet great again
being found liable in a civil lawsuit is not the same as being found “ guilty ” in a criminal court
almost the level of burden of proof is vastly different criminal is more higher
so diaper don is an adjudicated rapist does that help
i mean trump did just offer to shill for the petroleum industry in exchange for 1billion in campaign contributions
see this is the problem with the whole fact checking thing conservatives do n't believe in facts they do n't believe in climate change or rising sea levels so they just assume this cnn article is anti trump propaganda not fact checking
mar a lago is gon na be under water soon trump should invest in snorkels
text donald%20trump's%20brazen%20pitch%20to investigating%20the%20issue%20has%20said donald will reverse progress we 've made on tackling climate goals
it would have been really nice if biden had clearly and concisely called out how bafflingly stupid donald ’s answer on climate was when 50 million people were watching
fact trump is a moron but facts do n't seem to matter to his followers
that ’s an oddly specific number
yeah but biden had a bad debate night so this sub wants him to step down and let trump run the country
well sure he is a moron
lol why are they fact checking djt why what does it even achieve at this point
he was ill and trying to refute a shitstorm of lies with facts and figures i do n’t know how you debate a bloviating megalomaniac
so you ’re saying trump actually lied very interesting
the time to call him on that would have been in the debate
in other news the maldives which have been sentenced for decades now to be the first islamic underwater republic has not only been unaffected by sea rise but has islands actually growing
biden should step down replace him with a competent dem
i do n't understand why americans think they have a large enough population to stop climate change
such an easy point to make after he talked about his clean energy and water points
way to speak for an entire populous lol i
he will realize how much the sea levels are rising when he gets his next insurance bill for mar a lago
those guys who tried to flood the security office with pool hoses to destroy stolen document evidence could have just waited for the tide
well that ’s an obvious mischaracterization
wrong we want someone who has a better chance of beating trump biden did himself no favors last night with the independents he may have also turned off some lukewarm dems
nah we just want someone who can remember where he is to be the dem nominee
biden is a competent dem he had one bad day you have them i have them everyone has them throwing out the baby with the bathwater is foolish
population size does n't matter that much consumption does i 'm pretty sure we 're near or at the top for consumption especially per capita
our government at least acknowledging it would slow it down some
he may have also turned off some lukewarm dems how unbelievably stupid would you have to be to let trump win over biden
i 'm voting for whoever tf is running against trump in november i 'm not all that excited about it being biden but the alternative is catastrophic to our country and the world
because the middle of the road independents want newsom kamala i keep hearing another candidate but never a name that would even poll as strong as biden is after the debate what candidate is there that is desired by that group no one knows it ’s a complete crapshoot
false that was n’t a bad day that ’s being senile let ’s get a dem that does think we waged war against medicare
we are declining and just about everyone else is going the wrong way africa is absolutely going to blow up over the next decades and there is nothing we can do about it
the rank and file voters of america do not see the stakes the way the majority of this sub does that is the political reality that ’s why they had the debate because they want to whip votes biden ’s performance historically bad against an incredibly weak candidate probably did not help that effort that ’s the political reality you can scream about that being stupid or whatever but that is not going to whip votes either biden ’s job was to instill confidence
they might just get discouraged and stay home everyone downplaying this will live the regret it mark my words
of course we are n’t the ones i ’m worried about it ’s low information voters who are still undecided
it ’s a crapshoot keeping biden on the ticket but clearly nobody wants to hear that
a lot of the greenhouse gases produced in china are for the production of goods consumed in america greenhouse gas production is not a great metric even then what are you suggesting we throw up our hands and just start pumping out more co2
how would it be regrettable what 's the alternative here you want to try to run a non incumbent who has n't won a primary to try to beat trump in 4 months if the democrats run whitmer or newsome they 're just sacrificing them neither can win with 4 months left especially not against trump i 'm not going to regret shit an old man with a cold should be downplayed i 'm not going to listen to the shills and the delusional about what the dnc should do we 've all seen both presidencies a debate should n't and does n't mean a whole lot even the current undecideds have already done this vote before and look who won their personal experiences since then are going to guide their vote more than any debate
well the more you say it the more you legitimize it as an option the fact is this debate should not really change anyone 's mind about anything it gave us no new information
i 'm suggesting with a little critical thinking you could realize that spending an outrageous some of money to fix a problem that is n't ours to fix is certainly an option but not the one i 'm voting for
well it gave me some new information but clearly acknowledging what i saw with my own eyes is very unpopular
examples of reverting law the right to abortion affirmative action union agency fees deference to agencies and these are just a few of the biggies since neil gorsuch walked into the stolen seat
yeah this should be a much bigger story than the lack luster presidential debate it ’ll take so much energy to get the agencies running smooth again and that energy will need to come from congress who have been hobbled for years it ’s like dumping sugar in a gas tank
when i was a kid in elementary school 70s we would have these smog alert days where we could n't go out for recess i guess we may see those days make a comeback
the republican appointed supreme court might honestly do a better job of firing up democrats than anyone since obama
i ’ll tell you if trump gets elected the supreme court will make sure all of the power in the country is consolidated into the hand of hard right conservatives regardless of what the majority of the citizens want this is how authoritarian regimes start
with laws having to be even more specific now nothing will get done congress ca n't even get their shit together and pass any laws already wtf are they going to do when they have to draft rules into the bills
i mean she ’s just unequivocally correct it ’s jarring to see so many important long standing precedents completely discarded it ’s like stare decisis means nothing now
the scotus has a job to do unfortunately for us that job is to ensure conservative dominance over the legal system while conservatives work to fully capture the other two branches and complete their authoritarian takeover of the federal government we may very well see the final death of our democracy soon
tldr tony kushner wrote a scene in angels in america in 1990 predicting the primary goal of republicans is to stack the supreme court i hope this does n’t get buried as i have n’t seen much written about this what has been slowly eating at me since the sc right wing takeover happened is that decades ago i watched this predicted by tony kushner before he wrote lincoln munich and many other movies one of his first and imo most important works was angels in america which explored politics gay culture and the onset of aids in the middle of this play roy cohn the only factually historical character in the play is sitting with a young lawyer he aims to recruit to his cause not being disbarred for doing shady shit during this scene roy cohn discusses a strategy that started in the reagan years of taking over the federal government with political appointees with the ultimate goal being to stack the supreme court iirc this scene was written as early as 1991 it was also a pivotal scene in the hbo production that had its debut in 2003 what i had n’t known is that after roy cohn was mccarthy ’s lap dog and an advisor to reagan he took a job as a mentor to the rising star son of a real estate magnate more than happy to pay what roy asked in exchange for his tutelage on how to bully others and utilizing the media to win legal battles that rising star was donald trump most people know that in 2016 dt was unprepared to take office as he did n’t necessarily expect to win while getting centrists and leftists like myself in a fever with build the wall drain the swamp rhetoric he did manage to pull off roy cohn ’s primary political goal stacking the supreme court full of republicans with a lifetime appointment to their jobs what still amazes me is that tony kushner totally called this at a time when donald trump was nowhere near being thought of as a potential president while i do n’t think tk thought trump would be president he was right on the money when it came to what the right wing priority was thirty years before it actually happened i still do n’t understand why i have n’t seen anyone write anything on this subject
it ’s difficult to overstate the destructive impact the conservative majority ’s abandonment of stare decisis is and will be until the court is overhauled which may only be done by congress by overhauled i mean term limits a self executing code of ethics if you fly to alaska on harlan crowe ’s private jet and he gifted you a motor home you do n’t get to sit on a case brought by his self funded pac fucking recuse yourself with a separate mechanism for enforcement by a bipartisan committee etc comprised of something like retired federal judges legal scholars members of congress etc that rotate regularly and may not be political appointees easier said than done i know laws relating to a sitting president ’s right to nominate and receive timely hearings regarding a replacement justice and immediate removal from the bench of any justice who is found to have lied to congress during their confirmation hearings which is a felony every conservative justice on this court stated unequivocally on the congressional record that roe was settled precedent and confirmed their commitment to the legal doctrine of stare decisis which in latin roughly means “ let the decision stand ” adherence to this long standing principle is critical to any functioning judiciary and society ’s need for predictable continuity in the law unfortunately the court issued several more precedent annihilating decisions yesterday with presidential immunity expected as soon as monday
iirc gorsuch loathes chevron and was likely one of the reasons he was selected
democracy is under an active attack what do americans do nothing
not all precedent is created equal chevron has always been sketchy
it ’s wild they ’re reverting stuff most people spent thier entire lives with
i ’ve seen this predicted since he got the seat
so when are there going to be hearings about the appointees lying to congress they ca n't let this slide
the seat is n’t stolen mcconnell found a loophole for his agenda
do nt forget about citizens united unlimited sugar in the tank to make sure nothing gets done in congress therefore allowing corporations to run wild and the courts to have even more power what a bunch of a holes
i wonder what foreign adversaries would like what exactly this wild makes you wonder where all the dark money comes from
both are equally devastating they 've nearly completed creating the environment for fascism to arise we are very close
do n’t worry the kids wo n’t be in school they ’ll be in church
yeah and then what this experiment is over all we can do is try to climb back in the boat to hang on for a few more years and then i foresee this ending violently
the project2025 manual lays all that out as the objectives of the first 180 days if you have not checked it out john oliver just did a piece on it
i feel like i ’ve seen some writing on it maybe not on tony kushner specifically but definitely the gop ’s goal of stacking the court check out democracy in chains the deep history of the radical right 's stealth plan for america by nancy maclean and the scheme how the right wing used dark money to capture the supreme court by sheldon whitehouse
yup like his mama before him
so when are there going to be hearings about the appointees lying to congress they ca n't let this slide only if the dems take a 2 3rd majority basically if you want rights for women people of colour children in fact anyone other than exceedingly rich white males and corporations run by rich white males then you need to vote for democrat candidates for congress the senate and the presidency at every opportunity
they ca n't let this slide watch them
as soon as dems get a solid majority unfortunately that ’s not happening anytime soon project 2025 is in motion
but he only allowed its use when it served his purposes
bingo it ’s simple logic fighting without fighting old as time it ’s working wonders as we sit and watch these traitors chip away at the foundations of this country
not if we can help it
pray for your health and safety
nah church is for sunday in the factories and mines during the week
now more than ever is a great time to not have kids
take the house and senate and then expand the court
thanks for the recommendations i was specifically speaking about tony kushner primarily because of how dead on he was 30 years ago could n’t find a yt link for the scene itself but i know it ’s in there
i understand that but should n't be called out anyway just taking this does n't feel right either kavanaugh c s have lied to congres sc judges lied to congress what a timeline hopefully we can put garland in there not a fan but such an upgrade from roberts the larping crook
that ’s how politics and agendas work
not sure why you would think anything i said suggested it should n't be called out
most moral bombs in the world
i wonder if they will make the way to ukraine
i thought biden said no 2 000 pounds bombs went to israel
ukraine should have received them instead washington june 28 reuters the biden administration has sent to israel large numbers of munitions including more than 10 000 highly destructive 2 000 pound bombs and thousands of hellfire missiles since the start of the war in gaza said two u s officials briefed on an updated list of weapons shipments between the war 's start last october and recent days the united states has transferred at least 14 000 of the mk 84 2 000 pound bombs 6 500 500 pound bombs 3 000 hellfire precision guided air to ground missiles 1 000 bunker buster bombs 2 600 air dropped small diameter bombs and other munitions according to the officials who were not authorized to speak publicly
hamas must be destroyed hamas are rabid religious fundamentalist antisemitic animals who attacked israel in an attempt to genocide the jews bombs are just a part of war
for all the senility flack he is getting biden had to remind trump there were american troops in afghanistan during trump 's first term
as mentioned in the article they paused one shipment of bombs in may the war started last october with heaviest bombing campaign at beginning so there were many other shipments that went through
in the meantime what ’s happened in israel we ’re finally the only thing i ’ve denied israel was 2 000 pound bombs they do n’t work very well in populated areas they kill a lot of innocent people we are providing israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them
when did he say that he denied a shipment for a bit due to concerns about the rafah invasion but he never made that claim
do n't we already give more military aid to ukraine than any other country gives it 's not impossible for the us to send aid to more than one country at a time
how exactly does killing more than 40 thousand innocent civilians 90 % civilian death rate do anything besides ensure hamas has infinite recruits for several more generations
but that ’s what redditors are into now
biden lied during the debate then
that ’s the quote i heard thanks
during the debate look it up
how about no military aid to other countries maybe some money for healthcare education and the homeless that would be a better use of money if congress actually cared about us
what exactly does a 90 % death rate mean wether you like it or not israel has maintained a 1 2 ratio of fighters killed per civilian deaths on average it ’s a 1 9 ratio civilians per enemy combatant hamas reports any death combatant or not as a civilian death so if you use their numbers you are just wrong
hamas uses human shield tactics get mad at them not israel human shield tactics do not work and are not legitimate
i do n't think he lied so much as said there were not going to be more 2000 lb bombs going forward during the debate he was stating his policy since may not his policy since last october and no more 2000 lb bombs going forward is good because although israel already bombed the hell out of gaza with us bombs before may they have n't flattened all of it yet and they might have continued using large bombs to flatten rafah and bomb the tent camps if there was no us push back so obviously the situation is terrible but it could be even worse and republicans gave biden hell for even pausing that one shipment
biden lies a lot but people see trump 's insanity and assume the other guy must be honest because that 's totally how it works though its not totally clear exactly what he was saying in the debate
he did n't say no 2000 lb bombs went to israel do you have the quote
i 'd rather we fight russia in ukraine and the terrorists in israel than here
you 're just wrong the gaza health ministry has a decades long record of accurate accounting and their numbers are supported by the un not only is it a lie that hamas reports combatant deaths as civilian deaths this is a specific propaganda line meant to reverse the reality which is that israel counts every single male they kill as a hamas combatant
i think biden told the truth that he wants to pause 2000 lb bombs but the context is pause since may after substantial quantities were already dropped delivered to israel to restock not pause since last october my preference would be for democrats to replace biden with someone like chris van hollen who is on the record stating that the us should apply stronger oversight concerning weapons transfers to israel and that the state department not water down reports of war crimes that might impact the transfers however i still think biden is 100x better than trump trump dodged all of the hard questions at the debate climate change economic inequality palestinian state because his positions on these issues are for sale to his campaign donors trump 's policy on the conflict is to give israel a blank check which is not a good idea due to the far right shift in israeli politics
uhh yea no i totally disagree nice try gas lighting
biden in the meantime what ’s happened in israel we ’re finally the only thing i ’ve denied israel was 2 000 pound bombs they do n’t work very well in populated areas source biden trump debate transcript
it ’s already commented here if you look hard enough
can you please define terrorists both sides in israel conflict are terrorists one with us help
then please direct me to a location where the pa lists casualties from this war listed with fighters kia and i will stop saying this
gaza ’s health ministry does n’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count the ministry never distinguishes between civilians and combatants that becomes clearer after the dust settles when the u n and rights groups investigate and militant groups offer a tally of members killed
when does he say no 2000 lb bombs went to israel because that quote does n't say that context matters
the pa does n't have a count look up the un numbers if you want
yes i never claimed they did my claim was that israel reports all deaths of palestinian males as combatants
no they do n't but hamas does report many male combatant deaths as women and children it 's not 40 000 dead and its not a 90 % civilian casualty rate i see someone is still believing the debunked hamas numbers david attenborough voice and now when refuted with facts the wild virtue signaling hamas apologist downvotes and leaves the conversation hoping to peddle its dribble to another less sourced comment section a sad pathetic life
i ’m really getting sick of extremists forcing their belief system on everyone else i noticed that there is no directive to teach the quran or the book of mormon or the talmud
are these the same people who were terrified a few years ago because somehow sharia law was going to be enforced in the united states
so now teachers need to be armed with guns and the bible they have to be teachers cops and ministers
as a canadian i thought the united states constitution said “ freedom of religion “ it looks like politicians ’ courts are forcing one religion on everyone
in an interview with nbc news walters said if a teacher refuses to follow the bible instruction mandate they ’d face the same consequences as one who refuses to teach about the civil war the punishment could include revocation of their teaching license he said a process that requires a vote by the oklahoma state board of education which walters chairs be sure they teach about the witch trials as well so muslim or buddhists need not apply this is going to turn out like the idaho abortion ban all the ob gyns left the state good luck oklahoma parents i also want to know which version of the bible they are supposed to use as textbooks catholic or protestant hav different stories
is n’t oklahoma already the worst ranked state for education
have fun trying to find teachers who want to teach in that environment
this guy cheated on his wife with a fellow teacher and she cheated on him with a coffee shop owner some christian
jumpin jeebuz this is stupid fascist theocracy oh goody
christian nationalism starts with indoctrination
sounds like a nice lawsuit
is n’t this what hitler did to jews in germany then most of europe
i am so sick of this crap
this is just beyond insane how are these states any better than the taliban at this point
ryan walters did n’t lose his license when he had an affair with a coworker while teaching school his wife had an affair with the owner of a coffee shop in their hometown as well how christian and this man will fire teachers for not teaching the bible he ca n’t even keep the commandments and literally everyone in oklahoma knows it
i am now convinced that children should not be subjected to the frightfulness of the christian religion if the concept of a father who plots to have his own son put to death is presented to children as beautiful and as worthy of society 's admiration what types of human behavior can be presented to them as reprehensible ruth hurmence green
pretty sure the supreme courts latest rulings on work place religious freedom beg to differ but i ’d never expect thomas and alito to be anything but rank hypocrites
brain drain of oklahoma is already bad enough and then this happens
i once taught the book of genesis in a sequence that includes parallel myths by jf bierlein the epic of gilgamesh genesis here and madeline miller ’s circe it has its place in quality secular academic programming i show students where and how the text was put together and where it falls geographically in relation to other myths at a private school with a wide range of beliefs and values among the student population as long as a professional academic tone prevailed we were completely actually free to design our own content this was a very popular class this could be a win win approach quality content out of malicious compliance or start with the book of judges just to get down to some bad stuff
they 're going to waste millions settling lawsuits if they do wasting taxpayer dollars on performative legislation is the gop idea of art
they say you have to teach it but in what context i would teach it through the lense of it being made up by man to control the masses
i teach in an inner city school with a large latino population and unfortunately a lot of families would be ok with this i am not but i think 50 % of my students would say the lord 's prayer and profession of faith before they said the pledge of allegiance to the united states of america which was the entity educating them or for a good healthy percentage just providing child care while their kids slothed their way through the day on their way to their next fortnite binge what is crazy is that i had a religious student 11 years old who made another student really uncomfortable over their non belief in god same kid still believed in santa claus
seems like a solid get rich quick gamble for a teacher if you appeal it long enough i 'm sure you 'd eventually win a lawsuit over being fired for not teaching the bible
so then the students are going to learn that the correct punishment for disobedient children is death by stoning deuteronomy 21 18 21 “ if a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and though they discipline him will not listen to them then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives and they shall say to the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard ’ then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones ”
so teach the stuff that isn't cherry picked by conservatives lol i 'd have some fun with that
yeah man i really want the gym teacher teaching my kids theology s
brain drain people leave these states for actual jobs because of globalization and this is what ’s left i ’m actually a proponent of keeping jobs stateside but this is what america focuses on
so teaching a book of myths seems relevant after watching the debate
if the god he believes in truly exist i ca n't wait for that god to return it 's gon na be an amazing to see just how mad the god will be at this moron
ok we need some oklahoma english teachers to break down this piece of fiction get some history teachers to show where most of the locations do n’t exist right now and for science teachers show how it ’s not scientifically possible that the earth is only 6009 years old i mean it ’s still a bible based curriculum
“ christians worship a demi god zombie ” teacher forced to teach crap
lesson 1 bible the first part of the bible is about and angry god that would wake leaders up and tell them of a people that had angered him and instructed the leader to go kill them all in my name and steal their shit he would instruct fathers to kill their children l excuse my offensive words but this is ludicrous if anything teach religion as a subject from middle school until graduation not religious indoctrination but all the horrors millennia of pedophilia from religious leaders put religion where it belongs and keep it out of government teach the good things also teach that not believing in any religion is good also has n't god and all his religions killed enough people or has been all the people using god that have killed enough people already let 's teach our children to understand it and how to use or not
classroom bible study “ rub a dub dub thanks for the grub amen ”
and i had already heard soooo many good things about oklahoma before this stuff s if that 's really needed here
shove your buybull it 's a hateful tribalistic book full of fantasies taking it seriously is insane
can we hire any teacher fired for this reason over here in colorado good way to reduce the shortage with teachers who have integrity
imagine being a young person in ok looking at careers this rules out teacher i feel for this generation
maybe they can teach the parts about stoning people for having garments of different materials or whatever some of these bull crap passages was
you can only push people so far before the end up on your doorstep
maybe they could hire somebody to teach them the constitution
just say no and that it ’s your firmly held belief
i 'd rather shit in my hands and clap than take a bow to this cockroach
then there gon na start bitching nobody wants to teach anymore and frankly i ca n’t blame anyone for it wanting to teach sounds like a flat out miserable job where you spend all this time in college learning just to essentially babysit but have to still do continued work education all while making a laughable wage no way in hell i should be making more then a teacher does
blatantly unconstitutional but good luck getting mcconnell trump ’s supreme court to disallow it
i bet they fucking wo n’t
see these morons ca n't see past their forearm what happens w a majority muslim town makes teaching the koran mandatory or some wiccan wants their book taught or a hindu you assume you have the numbers until you find out that you do n't
i ’m not for this but now i ’d like to know if the school districts will provide the bibles to the classrooms if so where do they plan to purchase them from would i be shocked if it turned out to be the same bibles trump has hawked nope
he 's begging for malicious compliance
check his computer he fits the bill of someone who is hiding a dark secret
imagine getting your teaching license years ago and now this
can they just teach from the song of solomon i am sure there are other parts that would be found objectionable but still from the bible also which bible
ca n’t we just jail this chucklehead for violating our constitution
til he gets sued into the ground
the chance that even this supreme court rules in this guy 's favor is extremely minimal and i 'd be surprised if oklahoma 's own supreme court tolerates this shit for long i just wish we did n't have dipshits like this instituting clearly illegal laws and then not being punished in some way such as being personally held liable for the cost of defending it in court
are they supposed to use it as a history book or a science book
ca n’t wait for some fringe religious groups to sue in court saying our book xyz should also be taught as it is under assault
i assume a lawsuit is already filed
this guy has wannabe dictator all over him state superintendent is just the appetizer he wants his name out there so he can run for congress and maybe potus
picking the end of a school year to do this is just extra stupid oklahoma is about to not have any teachers left in the state
why are public school teachers now qualified to preach or go back to college again to keep the job you are trained for
imagine going to college and getting a degree and a teaching cert and starting a job to educate students and then being told you will be teaching the bible
beware the law of unintended consequences
nobody in their right mind thinks this rule is going to stand he is just upping his name recognition for a future governor senate run keep an eye on this dude
exactly why does oklahoma want teachers with no theological training to teach the bible sounds like a sure fire way to confuse kids and drive them away from the faith
i would teach the duck out of the bible if forced no picking and choosing things like do not kill good things like love everyone good marry and cleave from your family good sex with goats bad it would be hilarious fafo
a few lawsuits ought to bankrupt this school and needs to be done
these dudes are just attention whores landry was getting tons of press so this piece of trash attention whore had to go further stop putting these skanks in the news
teachers need to find all the crappy passages in bible and teach those slavery incest
careful y’ all if anyone actually there reads the book it is for certain getting banned i ’ve read it pretty sure it was supposed to be a trilogy are they going to ban certain verses and not others i mean just open it to a random page and 50 50 it ’s going to be something raunchy
starting next school year “ schools closed due to teachers quitting and moving out of state ” parents and school boards “ why can we find no teachers ”
simply let them take action against you then sue them stating they forced upon you against your freedoms and religion christianity to preach amid the square like when jesus was a boy is sacreligious or as a catholic that you are not a lay person or you are a woman and not allowed to preach you will win the lawsuit you are already protected class you will win and it will be based on religious freedom how ironic or moronic at this point sue them
would love for teachers to teach biblical criticism and archaeology and some of the lesser known biblical laws and practices
can we not just teach math english etc why do we have to throw in the bible pride etc let them do that a home
this is like how iran went backwards when the mullahs took over
because we are n't taking their threat to our lives and our country seriously the people who vote them are just as evil and determined too act accordingly
not far and fast enough for the fascists
time to invest in hijab niqab burka production companies extra points for putting “ maga ” on them
just wait until trump replaces thomas alito and sotomayor
just a few yrs back everyone in the us was pissed off about these religious schools creating radicals in other countries and many people were talking about military action to stop these “ terrorist training camps ” now this un american extremist radical dickhead wants to do the same here see it for what it is this shit for brains intolerant fundamentalist wants the government to control what your child values everything he stands for is the opposite of what the founding fathers created do n’t let this mentally challenged shit stain destroy america fight like hell for our freedoms when these religious zealots try to impose their rule over your life we do n’t need his morality police enforcing his brand of bullshit he can kindly get fucked
it ’s ok if it ’s their form of sharia law
they do not now and never have believed in the laws a a neutral unbiased force in america they believe in hierarchy and they believe the laws should reinforce that
and how much you wanna bet when there ’s a teacher that does n’t confront an active shooter they absolutely destroy them personally and legally unlike how cops get treated
easy solution make the bible bigger plate the cover with kevlar hollow it out and stick a gun inside 3 in 1 school supply we all know they never cared about what 's inside the bible anyway
this is blatantly unconstitutional but i 'm not sure if that matters anymore
you ’re correct but what we have seen and heard lately from even top gop officials is that the constitution does not say anything about freedom from religion in other words they are going to say that you are free to choose your religion or even not have a religion but you are not free from religious laws i ’m serious
you are free to practice the religion the republicans have chosen for you
religion is a freedom from not a freedom of
teach about all the bad things that god has done like telling a father to kill his son to prove his faith because he 's so insecure or how he killed all the first born children of egypt then when parents sue the school for traumatizing their kids they can explain how all that education is somehow necessary
they worked hard to get there and they 're fighting to keep that rank
49th they can still get to the bottom
their goal is to kill off public education and divert all the public funding to religious groups and corporations that is the point drive out the motivated good teachers and replace them with private religious school teachers the private school teachers tend to have less licensing requirements and lower pay it ’s a win win for the privatization movement if they run out of teachers they can just play a video and make all the kids at school watch it probably a joel osteen sermon to start the day then a scarier brimstone sermon to end the day
what 's worse is we were already losing teachers because they are nt paid enough here
that 's the point if there are no qualified teachers they 'll have to hire unqualified religious nuts
and then the conservative stacked courts will agree with him it 's joever
yes hitler even had the support of the reigning pope at the beginning of hitler ’s terror
ok children you have homework for tomorrow but it ’s easy i want each one of you to bring a rock to class tomorrow
supreme court will pick a winner
unfortunately they have another work unit that is in charge of court packing and they have been quite successful they are intentionally asking to be sued this will probably be ruled ok by at least one court if not the highest court
stonewall is american history so that should be taught
in the bible pride etc i 'm not sure how these things are comparable i 'm not even sure what the fuck pride is can you explain
there might eventually be a revolution
they decry the theocracy in iran yet want the exact same thing here the only difference is the religion they profess to follow
and we ’ll continue to go backwards after republicans win the presidency house and senate this year
omg they want to impose sharia law on us
totally agree but maybe do n’t say “ fight like hell ”
no qualified immunity for teachers
not to this supreme court
that ’s an outright misrepresentation of the 1st amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion which was extended to the states by the 14th amendment the federal government and states are constitutionally barred from enforcing religion on the people
freedom to be non religious
even today 's supreme court would n't agree with this too much cost of credibility with no significant gain aside from maybe a few free vacations or an rv this and the louisiana ten commandments bill are just political stunts notice that they 're coming just before an election
i mean the bible is also history so
probably lgbt pride is what they are referring to i do n't get why they throw tantrums about having to tolerate people
then let 's not let it happen
i did n’t say i agreed i repeated what they stated and are clearly trying to do here ’s a quote by pence
lol scotus just legalized corruption and basically said regulatory agencies can not regulate anything specifically outlined in a statute to the nth degree they have no credibility and do n't care this scotus will absolutely get on board with requiring teaching the bible in school
the bible is a work of fiction so there that should we teach grimms fairy tales as fact too
some of it maybe most of it is fairy tales maybe it has a place in creative writing classes
well there 's a difference between teaching the contents of the bible as history and teaching that the bible as a book is part of history the gop want to do the former
probably lgbt pride is what they are referring to that much was clear but i still do n't know what he means by that
every state trying to push the bible in schools needs activists from all other religions to insist they also be allowed to teach their own holy books display commandments conduct in school services prayer etc
you have n’t read the bible lol it ’s hilarious that i say we should n’t teach it in schools and still get downvoted by triggered liberals i hope it ’s real for the sake of bringing all of you to your knees lmao
i mean not everyone agrees with that is my point some people believe it and it helps them keep going in life some people do n’t and could careless
how are those different teaching the contents as history would directly reference the book if we want to teach history it ’s going to involve alot do cultures and ideas that everyone wo n’t agree with
they ’ll argue that the us is not founded on satanism or eastern religions they ’ll argue we are free to be muslim or atheist but not free from christian laws i have said this repeatedly but few want to accept it they are trying to build a christian nation
well it is n't it 's made up stories your fever fantasy about the second coming of christ will never happen your sick fantasy about non christians being punished by god will never happen i have read the bible by the way decent read but at no point did i think a single bit was factual i 'm not sure if you 're sadistic by nature or it was taught to you by religion but it is n't a good look
i hope it ’s real for the sake of bringing all of you to your knees lmao it 's happening in oklahoma professor it 's only hurting people like you but hey kudos for letting everyone know how old you are mentally
who cares if they agree if someone wants to believe the bible is fact that 's their prerogative it 's a personal choice we should not be teaching children in public schools that the bible is fact
some people believe it and it helps them keep going in life cool they can learn about it and read it at home or parents can make the choice to send their kid to a religious based private school plenty of people do n't believe and do care plenty of people read the quran torah tripitaka and other religious texts should those be taught alongside the bible where should we stop you said can we not just teach math english etc maybe we wo n't have time to cover those if we 're focusing on pushing religion you do n't need need to learn to read when your pastor can just tell you the juicy bits
some people believe it and it helps them keep going in life cool they 're free too do so but you get how that 's different than forcing someone to teach a religion right
1 the bible is a historical record and it 's contents are things that happened 2 the document know as the bible and christianity have existed in history as have other religions and beliefs systems those are two different things
teaching the contents as history would directly reference the book no not necessarily we have plenty of proof that pontius pilate existed for example based on the writings of jewish historians without having to reference the bible
yeah my original comment agrees with that we should definitely care about what people believe whether we agree with them or not
see what denver did and follow that they gave homeless money and tracked it and reduced homelessness by 52 % most homeless are working poor they work full time but ca n’t afford housing if you work full time you should be able to afford food and housing
this is exactly what is going to happen in some cities alabama uses prisoners as laborers there 's currently a lawsuit about it because the prisoners are punished and beaten if they refuse to work even when sick alabama is bringing in 500 million year in prison labor would not be surprised when cities go out there and round up unhoused people so they can put them to work in prisons
gops determined to kill off ss which will put millions of elderly on the streets take the kids to visit grandma in her tent on south main “ the percentage of homeless single adults aged 50 or older has climbed steadily from 11 percent in the early 1990s to 37 percent in 2003 and now to nearly 50 percent in the 2020s the population of homeless individuals who are 65 or older is predicted to more than double by 2030 ”
we need a multi pronged approach to fighting homelessness including major deregulation of zoning to empower developers to increase supply making section 8 an entitlement to make sure that everyone who qualifies for section 8 housing aid can actually get that aid expanding access to mental health treatment and making it much easier to involuntarily force people to be institutionalized homelessness is a complicated issue that needs various different policies if we want to make a real difference
debtors prisons hmm has this happened before
there 's a way to tackle a significant percentage sadly arresting folks is n't one of them
you ca n't tell cold hearted conservatives supreme court justices that they are all knowing and above the law especially when it comes to illegal gift giving bribery and collusion
the system is totally broken according to internet searches there are 500 000 1 000 000 homeless people in the usa there are also 15 000 000 vacant homes in the usa the math ai n’t mathing
i agree criminaliizing homelessness is not going to solve the problem
red states watch us try
we cleared the jails of pot smokers and now we are going to use those cells for homeless people who can not pay their tickets at least they will get 3 meals a day
revenue generation is all that this is they do n’t care about the people they care about the money they can make off them arrest a homeless person give them a fine when they can pay that add o more fines when that fails throw them in prison and get that money
ah market and government working together to transform wage slaves into chattel slaves with the consent of the populace i suppose when they find someone taking a nap in a car in a parking lot the cops will whip out the ol' pantone color chart and maybe analyze the perp 's accent bank account family connections and politics to decide whether this is a case of normal god fearin middle class person taking a nap or filthy nonhuman also god forbid there be any public un owned land in the world all must belong to the anointed thug supported property owner class apparently ca n't even die alone in the wilderness if you 're not a cog in the boss 's machine you 'll be prison labor what a shitshow it 's not surprising at all but
if you arrest them and put them in a jail with no guards and let them come and go you 've invented a homeless shelter and it 's way cheaper
i thought i heard that it costs like 100k per prisoner or something seems like there 's a cheaper more humane way to deal with the homeless than jail
this is like florida trying to legislate away climate change
the supremes should be arrested for selling out america
so back to dickensian work houses
the only criminals here are some of the sc justice let 's face it those who 've accepted bribes are a disgrace of a human being s that will be remembered as a sellout and corporate slave at some point if it country manages to survive as a democracy we will need to go back and reverse these decisions that have just been bought and paid for already
um yes we absolutely can what we ca n’t do is keep doing more of the same because that shit is n’t working these people are very sick and they need help we have to be able to forcibly get them off the streets because they can not make positive constructive decisions themselves leaving them on the street to suffer is inhumane this is the humane way get them into mental hospitals so they can get the treatment and care they need and if they can recover hopefully help them reintegrate into society with housing and a job if they are violent or can not recover they can stay in prison or the mental hospital they can not be on the streets any longer
instead of assessing the fine for sleeping outside on a homeless person the city and county where they are should be fined
as i was reading this i thought of the story by dickens a christmas carol are there no workhouses are there no prisons
no but they can make you slave for being poor
maybe the homeless can camp out on those six lawns then
advocates advocating who would have thunk it as usual accountability and responsibility are never even whispered as we make sure that it 's always someone else 's fault
people have a right to safe and accessible communities which can be hindered by homeless camps they should not be allowed to just sleep or stay wherever they want because it is a legitimate public health and safety issue while they should be provided services and shelter if they do n't take advantage of it for whatever reason then communities should absolutely be able to remove them
“ advocates ” code for homeless industrial complex
letting homeless people sleep urinate and defecate on sidewalks private property businesses and parks is not a solution sorry most of these people have drug or mental problems and should be taken off of the streets and put in facilities to actually help them i m still waiting to hear how letting homeless mentally sick lay all over the streets has benefited anyone in any way does anyone here know the percent of homeless that eventually get help and off the streets if you do n't know it 's next to zero most die from drugs being attacked disease or starvation dehydration good job
does this ruling allow or require if it allows then i bet some cities will not enforce
i 'm more surprised more cities have n't been sued for violating americans with disabilities act if the homeless are continuously blocking sidewalks there 's already precedent when cities ca n't fix sidewalks that have been damaged and unpassable due to lack of maintenance seems a major issue not discussed will be more homeless arriving in cities that wo n't ban public sleeping
no but cities around los angeles can use it to push their homeless on us like they already probably do this time they can be open about it
i ’m sick of seeing “ our most vulnerable neighbors tm ” get a pass for masturbating on the sidewalk exposing passersby to fentanyl smoke and stealing to support their habits this ruling is a good first step
no but you now have some teeth to force people to accept help instead of willfully being anti social
nah fuck the homeless either you ’re mentally ill and unable to care for yourself you ’re receptive to help and wo n’t be on the streets of help is offered or you can rot in jail because you ’d rather camp in the park rather than work
i hated reading that when the paymentexperimebt stopped after a year the guy featured in the article went back to sleeping in his car parked outside his work
yup this is about the free labor just modern day slavery i keep telling people slavery never ended it just looked different
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction 13th amendment seems to allow
that 's smart work off those fines that ca n't be paid
“ alabama is bringing in 500 million year in prison labor ” i find this hard to believe how productively can prisoners work within prison would n’t there be significant costs inspecting things going in and out if the job involves manual labor how do you provide effective oversight how do you get the right skill composition of laborers why would you hire a prison laborer even for for a buck an hour when you could hire someone outside of prison for minimum wage alabama had 25k inmates text the%20prison%20system private%20prisons%20or%20local%20jails including in county jails so according to your 500 million figure that comes out to 20k per person a full time job at minimum wage makes 14k per year so despite all of the things that would make prisoners an inefficient source of labor the prisoners are producing more than alabama minimum wage value for a full time job that ’s hard to believe do you have a source this just does n’t seem very plausible
but they posted the commandments on the wall and it said to honor your mother and your father and you insinuating that these christian nationalists do n’t follow their own commandments or is it just their mothers and fathers that need to be honored
“ we need a multi pronged approach to fighting homelessness including major deregulation of zoning to empower developers to increase supply ” agreed housing is expensive because there ’s not enough to go around there ’s not enough of it because developers ca n’t build developers ca n’t build because current owners do n’t want more housing getting restrictive zoning laws current owners do n’t want more housing because that would lower the price of their homes “ expanding access to mental health treatment and making it much easier to involuntarily force people to be institutionalized “ second half is spot on many of the homeless mentally ill have severe drug problems and do n’t want to quit yet it ’s one thing to use drugs and it ’s another to be sleeping under a bridge because of it if it ’s the latter then an intervention is warranted
a lot of homelessness is an obvious pathological consequence of broken systems something like 50 % of homeless people are ex cons who do n't get properly reintegrated into society job access specifically mental health single mothers drug addicts who are n't managed properly in society as you say public housing availability a study done in nyc showed that identifying particularly at risk groups like low income single mothers and just giving them money to keep them in their apartments decreased societal costs because getting someone out of homelessness picking them up from a fall is much less efficient and more expensive than just keeping them out of it assisting them when they stumble
state and city leaders already have the infrastructure for the simple solution arrest them all and put them to work slavery for the poor is an easy and attractive solution for people in power who wish to stay in power as long as they say the homeless person commuted a crime they can pretend they have n’t done anything wrong
never going to work homelessness is a symptom of capitalism just like climate control as well as well capitalism is to blame as well until that goes there will be millions of homeless until we burn to death
no housing is going to be affordable to the homeless they have zero income
looking the other way wo n't solve it either
karen bass is not in a red state and she was applauding this ruling today this is a bipartisan effort
they should be praised for helping us avoid becoming one big san francisco
start a gofundme for bus tickets for homeless people to all scotus judges that went for this houses and camp on their lawns
they ’re not being provided services and shelter though not nearly enough
apparently two of my replies to you were removed perhaps some mod considered it overly inflammatory which strikes me as a strange decision considering that i was directly addressing the arguments you made and making inferences only about other arguments they implied and in no way attacking you personally so let me try to rephrase it in a way hopefully more in accordance with their interpretation of the rules as i think you will find my take to be interesting and informative if someone were to use the word “ public ” as in “ public safety ” or the word people as in people have a right to to refer to a group of people that does not include the homeless i would say that this contains an implicit statement about who is and is not to be considered to be part of the public and that this entails an implicit value judgment about whose interests society ought to function for i would opine that maybe such value judgments ought to be directly stated and discussed because loading all of that onto a single word like public ’ makes it vague if someone were to imply that a group of people ought to be dealt with en masse because of some crime one considers to be commonly done by members of that group i would opine that this is maybe not in accordance with the principles of due process or really any conception of justice based on individual responsibility for crimes i am aware that sometimes people use the phrase “ individual responsibility ” to mean personal finances but here i am talking about criminal culpability which you and i are probably most accustomed to seeing applied to individual people for crimes they personally committed i would opine that perhaps you and i can recognize a certain alarming pattern here namely identifying a group as not being worthy of being considered part of the public society and holding it collectively responsible for individual crimes and justifying it by among other things making claims about how easy it is to get out of that group or how degenerate members of that group allegedly are and by making claims about how that group is of no benefit to the people that are considered to constitute society making it a question not of universal rights but of “ how does that benefit us ” does n’t that seem to you like a dangerous pattern an easy way to remove rights from people a template for a society were certain people have very little power indeed where anything can be justified with “ well it ’s safer for us that way ” and “ what do we owe them anyway ” it is an ideological position that brings with it a risk of hypocrisy as well if one ever finds oneself on the business end of the superior needs of a more powerful group
so this right to safe and accessible communities in your view is based on money right money and legal nationality right not on the basis of being a human being i assume and you totally would n't be fine with removing a person if they happen to own or rent real estate i assume
it ’s so well funded by all that homeless money
care to elaborate how giving homeless people criminal records will get them on their feet that surely wo n't impact them finding a job or applying for housing right are people saying that letting homeless people sleep on sidewalks will help them or benefit everyone else or are they saying that that should n't result in prison and that there are better and more humane options we could do instead
when i was homeless i was working full time if i 'd been arrested for sleeping rough i 'd have lost my job and would still be on the streets or dead tell me more about how criminalizing my existence would help
i hope that one day people like you find yourselves experiencing what you wish on others first hand
unfortunately solutions that studies have found statistically effective in reducing homeless addict mortality rates the 2 do not overlap in what little data we have as much as news outlets talking heads present the public perceives such as housing first practices and supervised injection sites are commonly defeated with unproven talking points and fearmongering by these same cities that want the ban so i do n't expect your solutions to actually be the route any of them take as opposed to the currently broken incarcerate release cycle that many of my homeless neighbors are already trapped in for nonviolent crimes
look the landlord demands a certain price for rent and the employer demands a certain price for labor
i mean southern states literally did do that it 's not in the least bit historically wrong to say that was the intent of slave states with the convict leasing system that was set up right after the war as a white southerner it 's always super awkward when i hear someone who is anti woke go on a rant about how school history books need to expand the teaching of slavery to include other forms beyond chattel
and it 's about to debated i guess you and the alabama doc missed the part where it does n't say you can beat and punish people if they 're too sick to work
people seemingly act like that portion of the 13th amendment is written in near microscopic print bizarre is n't it
you should learn to google things before you write a bunch of stuff just put in alabama prisoners forced labor there 's plenty about the lawsuits and how much money forced labor brings in edit pretty much every national media outlet has written about it
i offer into evidence robert morris spiritual guide to felon trump founder of the gateway church and confessed child rapist a man who never read a commandment that he felt applied to him christians do n’t follow the commandments why should anyone else btw 25 % of all catholics dioceses aka child rape centers have or are in the process of declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying compensation to the children they rape
regulated capitalism is fine and we do n't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater capitalism with sufficient regulations and safety nets is the only system that works
that 's why it 's free or heavily subsidized once back on their feet
how very christian of you to pick on the most unfortunate in our society
i think a lot of conservatives think we should hunger games them i really think they would be fine with that
there is tons of space in the usa and empty homes
somewhere that does n't endanger others we should n't have to put up with public endangerment or lose access to public spaces just to accommodate some homeless people if they 're doing something illegal like doing drugs then arresting them i think is perfectly fine
criminal records what the hell are you talking about i 'm talking about having non le people pick these people up take them to hospitals for evaluation for drugs mental health disease and treat them accordingly and then provide them some sort of housing environment where they can get clothes a bed food and medical treatment if they are n't capable of living on their own then we should provide care similar to hospice type environments if they are clinically insane then they will need long term psychiatric treatment but either way under what i 'm saying they would have food shelter medicine and some path to be able to live in some manner with dignity if they are just people with money issues the same applies except we connect them with jobs and let them come and go for as long as they need until they get back on their feet please tell me how is this so heartless and cruel you completely misunderstood what i said
ok i will bite what exactly was keeping you from finding a roomate and splitting rent or bunking with friends or family for a bit while you got on your feet it 's unacceptable to be sleeping on public property like that it should n't be tolerated
who said arrested when did i say arrested please show me i said processed which means taken to a facility for evaluation for drug or mental problems if those exist they are given the proper treatment if they do n't they are allowed to live in a facility that provides food water clothes and medicine if needed and helped to find employment until they are able to live on their own two feet those who are n't mentally insane or who are n't having drug issues are free to come and leave as they desire
what did i say that hurt you so much because i offered a solution that includes giving homeless people a path to get treatment or housing to get on their feet you think living on the street is the better alternative are you kidding
relatable i 'm about as lilywhite as it gets and i live in rural north carolina some of the stuff that 's overheard or directly heard here is wild
sweatshop owners be like “ let ’s not get into the details ”
google returns results based on what the user tends to click we ’d probably get completely different results why do n’t you post the link you think is credible
regulated capitalism is fine regulated capitalism is temporary and will always tend towards less regulations we 've had it for about 40 of our 250 years until you remove the financial incentives of unregulated capitalism this will always happen capitalism makes sociopathy profitable if you can pour chemicals into drinking water or cut your workers pay you get a bonus you ca n't regulate that
curious what does this regulated and working capitalist system look like was it when we had slaves was it when we had kids working in factories and losing limbs was it when we shifted our prisons into a for profit business that continues to use slave labor was it when every single product a consumer could ever buy decreases in quality as companies make shortcuts and fire people in order to keep the constant growth part of the capitalism equation alive is it now with record homelessness and impossible prices when did it work when does it work what are these regulations that protect us from this when have these regulations been put into play dismantling safety nets and regulations is integral to capitalism because capitalism fails without constant growth
many of the homeless are sleeping in tents because they refuse to follow shelter rules like no drugs just gon na hand out free housing no questions asked to the drug addicts cause that 's how you get drug dens
yes but they have no morals that is a proven fact
nah we ’d rather gladiator them put two homeless addicts in the arena and make em fight to the death over a baggie but the baggie might be fentanyl or it might be fake the twist is that it ’s always fake do it tournament style and tell them that every round the odds of the baggie having fentanyl go up it gets really brutal as withdrawal sets in but i bet they ’ll keep going the twist ending is that the final bag is fentanyl but it ’s overly pure the last homeless drug attic ods on the floor of the arena you might call it sick but you know as well as i do that they would participate for their fix
true but we would have confiscate these assets using eminent domain laws most americans are “ taxed out ” at this point
cool then you are willing to pay for that tax wise
criminal records what the hell are you talking about i 'm talking about the literal article about the supreme court giving the ok to arrest homeless people the article that you commented on implying people are advocating to let them sleep and shit on sidewalks you asked how that would help homeless people i simply asked how what the supreme court just allowed helps the decision sets “ a dangerous precedent that will cause undue harm to people experiencing homelessness and give free rein to local officials who prefer pointless and expensive arrests and imprisonment rather than real solutions ” ann oliva the ceo of the national alliance to end homelessness said in a statement she added that the ruling allows elected officials “ to shift the burden to law enforcement ” rather than focusing on “ long term sustainable solutions ” like funding affordable housing and supportive services which is 100 % different than what you are suggesting in your reply arrest records are public in some areas 24 hours after the arrest there 's no federal law against companies asking if an applicant has previously been arrested even colleges can ask if people have been arrested and use it against them i 'm talking about having non le people pick these people up take them to hospitals for evaluation for drugs mental health disease and treat them accordingly and then provide them some sort of housing environment where they can get clothes a bed food and medical treatment if they are n't capable of living on their own then we should provide care similar to hospice type environments if they are clinically insane then they will need long term psychiatric treatment but either way under what i 'm saying they would have food shelter medicine and some path to be able to live in some manner with dignity please tell me how is this so heartless and cruel you completely misunderstood what i said i feel like your first comment is the complete opposite of this response letting homeless people sleep urinate and defecate on sidewalks private property businesses and parks us not a solution sorry i 'm still waiting to hear how letting homeless mentally sick lay all over the streets has benefited anyone in any way as if arresting them letting shit on the sidewalks are the only things being discussed
we do n’t have resources for people with homes and health insurance what do you think you live in a society that cares about people you think middle class folks hate stepping over sleeping homeless people wait until they have to wait behind them or near them in emergency rooms edit to emphasize that i agree that we need a huge investment in our social services and support infrastructure it ’s why i always vote for democrats republicans refuse to feed school children and want to set up camps for immigrants they want to cut social security and gut medicare all of your solutions need huge investments
it 's comforting to know so many people have friends and family healthy and wealthy enough to act as a support system sleeping rough has been safer than rooming with strangers my last roommate raped and robbed me would it be better that i tolerate that to save the state from the injustice of me sleeping in the woods
bold to assume everyone has that good of a support system in their friends and family
it only trends towards less regulations if that 's the sort of politicians voters elect but that 's just how it goes there 's no great final victory after which politics is n't necessary such would be the case even with alternatives to capitalism a big problem with the alternatives is that there 's less ability for regular people to have a say so politics keeps happening but just ends up being done by authoritarian dictators or single parties insulated from public opinion and that can suppress all dissent
what do you think about european style welfare states
this is my favorite excuse it works not all homeless folks are drug addicts housing first also helps folks deal with addiction and mental health issues because they have a permanent reliable address
no i mean going to a public park should n't be potentially dangerous because of discarded needles or mentally unwell people those are spaces for all of us to enjoy since we all contribute to funding them not to be taken up by a small group even if they 're in need we should n't have to sacrifice our infrastructure and community spaces for them
is n't that what we 're already paying for towns already sweep homeless out of camps my point is they 're perfectly right to do that
first i think the misunderstanding is due to the fact you are linking my comments to the scotus i should have been clear i was just making a general comment on homelessness and a solution i think would be better irrespective of what this article states that i did not read so my comments are meant to stand on their own i think homelessness crisis is being completely mistreated by both sides and i think we need to provide the homeless which has a diverse group of origin problems to how they got where they are needs a diverse set of solutions that have paths to jobs treatment evaluation food water and safe longer term shelter i do n't think they should just arrest and move the homeless from parks and throw them behind overpasses or something but i also do n't think they should just be rotting out on the streets with essentially no way out
well not to worry there is soon to be involuntary housing for those who choose to ' sleep rough '
any personal support system and yeah i 'm assuming that normally when you get to the point where friends and family turn you away it 's due to destructive behavior so friends and family turn them away but the city society is expected to just let them run rampant
what 's the fantasy world how about having a real open discussion instead of just dissenting what 's your alternative because the current solution helps literally no one
better than criminalizing homeless to get more slaves in unregulated capitalism that 's for sure
great idea send the homeless to houston and they can deal with it
when homeless people go into a store to buy things they need because sometimes they have funds just not you know enough to have a place to live and they buy thing such as i do n't know menstrual products or socks the sort of things that shelters chronically never have they pay sales taxes on those items that sales tax goes to to state and city funds that pays for many things like those public spaces that are for all of us to enjoy so according to your logic the homeless do in fact contribute to funding them just like you and me i guess that means they have a right to use them if it bothers you that much stop complaining about how the homeless potentially make those spaces dangerous and campaign for services and housing for them even if some do n't want the services that may be provided that 's a small percentage they 're people like you me your loved ones and friends you 'd be surprised how easily a person can be perfectly fine in life and in the span of a short amount of time they literally have nothing with nobody around them having the resources to help
maybe slippery slope there though while i get your point sweeps do nothing but move the problem from one street to another how do we avoid continuing to do that
this brings us back to my original question who does that help imprisoning a person for homelessness means we 're paying for their food housing and medicine while denying the opportunity for meaningful work and improvement it costs everyone more and delivers worse results
ah so it 's my fault my parents died when i was a child my fault they had no other children and my fault that i separated from my friend group after they sided with my rapist thanks for clearing that up
the fantasy world you imagine where homeless people receive support to get back on their feet that does n't exist what does exist is a supreme court ruling allowing criminalization of homelessness which is the topic we 're discussing and i 've provided lived experience explaining how this ruling would have made the lives of the homeless materially worse and would encourage homelessness at the taxpayer 's expense
systemic housing change would be nice but will take many years forced treatment for mental health issues might be in order it 's a complicated issue so i 'm ok with temporary ways just to alleviate burdens while we solve the underlying causes
the result is them in jail and being unable to destroy public property that 's the positive you 're trying to look at it like the view of the homeless matters
i 'm a guy on reddit not a therapist and not giving life advice i will advocate for public policy that says sleeping on public property should n't be tolerated
it does n't exist you 're right i 'm saying it should exist and i never said anything about criminal records you also offered no solution as i expected
true thanks btw for a sane conversation it is a really tough issue
you 're trying to look at it like the view of the homeless matters thanks for putting your hate on full display
the result is them in jail and being unable to destroy public property again helping who imprisoning someone is more expensive than paying for the knock on effects of homelessness we lose money imprisoning them
again that ignores reality criminalizing homelessness means we pay a premium to house clothe and feed the homeless in prison we 're paying extra money to make things worse why would anyone want that
it should exist it does n't neither does fully automated luxury gay space communism we 're discussing the supreme court ruling not the tax base of candyland
“ sane conversation ” also “ conservatives have no morals ” yeah the vicar of morality speaks
no because you have to factor in the opportunity costs that homeless camps create how many people avoid areas with large homeless camps in them you ca n't really put a value on it but it 's damn sure a lot of people avoid their camps plus once you start locking them up they leave for less intolerable jurisdictions
if you want the solution that works you ca n't be cheap about it if they are in prison they are n't breaking stealing or making a camp that 's a bio hazard a person in jail is a person not taking a dump on the sidewalk
what my comment was just an alternative to today 's solutions that obviously do n't work so because i provided a solution that you clearly ca n't dispute you just say that it 's fantasy and i guess keep up the status quo that 's working so well you have a strong victim mentality
oh did i touch on a sore spot it is a fact that voting for trump requires you to dismiss or disregard multiple morals sorry if that truth bothers you
sure i ca n't because it 's not my field of study but folks with more knowledge and experience in the field can and have and it 's consistently been found that imprisonment is more expensive than the status quo and both are more expensive and less effective than housing first solutions
if you want the solution that works you ca n't be cheap about it if they are in prison they are n't breaking stealing or making a camp that 's a bio hazard if they 're in prison we 're paying luxury rates for their rent and food while depriving them of a path to improvement it 's the most expensive way to make things worse for everyone what public good does that serve
your comment amounts to things should be better a nice sentiment but without value
the justices in other words can look forward to missing their children ’s basketball games skipping out on date nights with their spouses and not really doing much of anything at all besides deciding the crushing weight of cases that are about to land on their desks yeah those justices are n't going to miss jack shit if people are going to sue to get their minor policy questions resolves they 'll just have to wait until the court gets around to it if at all
people are outraged it ’s almost as if we ’re all ready to continue to fight and stomp this bullshit out rather than giving up over one debate i ’ve only seen people talking about black jobs and the ruling that criminalizes homelessness today last night was bad but you ’re a real deal idiot if you think we ’re down and out
republicans used to have a hard on for chevron because it allowed them to easily roll back regulations when they were in power their souring on it perhaps coincidentally coincided with a black man running things and perhaps the realization they may have more trouble winning the white house in the future
this article pretends that these kings and queens of america care about the rulings and policies that will now just go unregulated how much waste can be dumped in a river in alabama whatever they think that they will stay late into the night and miss the great grandkids ’ soccer games sorting through the quagmire their ruling created please they will leave it to their corporate benefactors and sponsors to decide what happens to our country as designed this is part of the destruction of the federal government that they are killing so that they can be free to plunder and pollute our country
the supreme court just made a massive power grab it was absolutely designed to make the six justices responsible will never regret it not ever
the coup was not on jan 6th it had already happened the supreme court notably the six republicans are the de facto rulers of the united states there is no election result in 2024 that can realistically curtail their power we will be living under their rule until there is a revolution of some kind there is no viable way to encroach on that power within the us constitution it has to be outside of that
to those who think this is a good ruling because it takes power away from unelected bureaucrats i have a question why is it a good thing that people without knowledge or expertise have to craft detailed and specific regulations instead of the experts in any given field would anyone feel comfortable or even safe having our current congress make regulations for air planes or nuclear reactors or waste storage are we ok with effectively letting industry regulate itself again
regret lol how so there are no mechanisms to hold them accountable for anything they do and they have shown they are incapable of shame
the justices in other words can look forward to missing their children ’s basketball games skipping out on date nights with their spouses and not really doing much of anything at all besides deciding the crushing weight of cases that are about to land on their desks absolutely not us policymaking will simply grind to a halt as everything proceeds on their schedule not vise versa
scotus will outsource much of the decision making and writing to the same conservative legal organization that bring the cases in the first place
these conservatives on the supreme court will not regret this in the slightest the reason for this is because they choose which cases to hear so they will simply allow lower court rulings they agree with to stand by denying the case at the supreme court and will overturn lower court rulings they disagree with because those are the ones they will allow to be heard at all this effectively sets the supreme court up as the gatekeeper of administrative decisions in this country it is a massive power grab on their part and we should immediately resolve this via direct legislation passed in congress to do so however that will never happen because the republicans in congress explicitly work with the conservatives of the supreme court to make this the outcome and they will absolutely go to the mat to block any legislation you can look forward to a future of far more pollution and unchecked corporate power because that is exactly what this decision signals this probably dooms any ability we have to do anything about climate change whatsoever
seems like the supreme court needs help dealing with all those cases lets ask 3 more justices to join the supreme court before november tovhelp them deal with the workload
no no they wo n't not until democrats finally grow a backbone and stop being so damned scared of wielding their own power
it will come to regret really
i hope they come to regret it in the mean time it 's more likely we 'll be the ones regretting it
it has decided to legislate and execute such actions from the bench does n't that go completely against the constitution
our democratic republic is on life support right now we are potentially one election away from authoritarianism
simply ignore them they are completely illegitimate
perhaps the rest of the federal government should just ignore this ruling
the sheer stupidity of the right wing is fully exposed they think it makes sense for a judge to decide every little thing about a case if the congress did n’t decide all the details in a law they passed up until now a bunch of experts decided the details you know people who understand the things now a judge can decide if there is too much arsenic in your water or if we should decide to pause fishing because we are running out of fish hey judgy how many fish would make a healthy fishery great plan
now that i know that judges and lawyers are the best decision makers i 'm a tell my boss everything needs to be kicked over to legal set the building thermostat legal configure the internet legal select the email font legal
the court ’s decision to seize this power is all the more puzzling because it has already given itself sweeping authority people need to stop talking about it this way the court does n't and ca n't give itself power the most the court can do is say it now has this power it only actually acquires new power if the other branches of the government choose to go along with it the executive could very easily continue to operate as if the chevron doctrine was still in force by implementing the ruling as only applying to the specific case ruled on today each and every similar case in the future would be forced to work its way though the appeals process if the defendant does n't accept the alj 's conclusion they can always find some subtle way the facts differ from this case in a way that makes this ruling legally irrelevant in the eyes of the government the supreme court would presumably be forced to let most of those alj determinations stand by virtue of not having space on its docket to actually hear appeals any of them and then perhaps the cabal will remember why the constitution makes them subordinate to the other two branches
this article is so fucking dumb as if a supreme court justice is going to skip a kids birthday everything will get tied up in court so no regulation will exist
i think one side is playing by the rules while the other side is not until that changes its only going to get worse mmw at some point soon we are going to have states refusing to honour scotus decisions maybe a blue state maybe a red state either way scotus has lost all legitimacy
how long before another river of fire in cleveland
scotus does not make decisions the gop 6 receive decisions from leonard leo and the federalist society the gop 6 are then paid for their benchwarming and their epic emmy worthy performances
maybe they ’re tired of spending time on people ’s personal problems like steve bannon or donald trump
so they ’re going to regret being too busy if they are it is busy making secret agreements on their tips ’ for all these cases regulations we ’ll see about that how much you offering
and most likely to prevent the courts from being forced to relitigate every single challenge to a federal regulation filed in the last 40 years roberts also declares that “ we do not call into question prior cases that relied on the chevron framework ” i doubt lower courts will honor that restraint
how will they regret it will they regret the bribes they received were too small
still feel like playing by gops unconstitutional bs when you have the power democrats the problem with democrat leadership is they do n't strategize and plan ahead or use their power to maximize their effectiveness in policies they still think the gop are good faith politicians in a bad jam with trump at the current moment they got bamboozled out of supreme court picks and even tricked into forfeiting an easy obvious pick because lame duck session or some bs by the scheming party stop playing their games and act like a left wing party not republican lite wannabes ffs you do n't let your weak child tell you what he wants so why would you allow it in congress there is bipartisan leadership and partisan doormat i hope the democrat leadership have plans in place because it can only go downwards from here the corruption is out of control and you barely hear of it by the media
ignore them they have no enforcement mechanism
lol chevron was passed with the idea that agencies specifically would act in good faith they have not
ah so this is the coup i keep hearing about it ’s so hard to keep track of them now
lol imagine citing vox as a credible source
they are literally under no obligation to do their job with no consequences they can just not do anything with it and they have their job unless impeached or they just return all the cases to the previous courts nonstop they have a lifetime job where they get to do whatever they want
and scotus is n't likely to take up most of these cases it 'll be on the lower courts scotus may take some up when there 's a nice gratuity they could get just like the waiter whose eager to serve the customers they know tip well scotus corruption insures plenty of free refills served with a lick and a tug
judge merchan still has the opportunity to do the funniest thing at trump 's sentencing next month
hell yeah we have 4 months plenty of clips from that debate will circulate but continued right wing scandals and more debates could very well wipe out any negative effects from the debate i 'm definitely coping here but i 've heard before that debates do n't have a major effect on the outcome of elections
this is the attitude we need more of
this we need more of this and go out there to persuade the undecideds and register more people to vote for dems
if all we do is vote and complain on reddit we ’re hosed
or that the federal agencies have not been acting in good faith and are making changes to rules and enforcing them as if they were law without going through congress case and point atf with just about anything
again the constitution was written by landed elite to entrench their power only fdrs unprecedented four terms allowed a liberal sc super majority to divert the constitutions natural bias
there is no election result in 2024 that can realistically curtail their power a democrat trifecta with the enough people to expand the court or even do impeachment could do it it certainly is n't likely but it is what is needed
it ’s why they did n’t care if trump lost they have the courts they can legislate from the bench
realistically biden wins the dems keep the senate and one or two supreme court justices die or are forced out if we get two then we have a majority
the court only has power if people listen to them there is a limit to how much bullshit people will put up with before they just ignore the court
i mean 2 3 of congress could do it
industry does not regulate itself beyond making sure they increase the profits these agencies and powers granted to them did not come out of thin air they happened because industry has already proved time and time again that it will not regulate itself for worker and consumer safety in fact but because regulation is a “ cost ” and not a “ profit ” it is specifically antithetical to their capitalist beliefs slavery triangle waist shirt factory the coal miner riots at the end of the 1800 ’s in w virginia company towns “ milk ” that has everything but milk in it drugs that do nothing near what they are advertised to and instead cause more harm any of this ringing any bells the list is endless really “ regulations are written in blood ”
no but you see now guns ca n't be regulated so hard and corporate profits will skyrocket that 'll show the libs as i sip my poisoned drinking water and die
because handing it to unelected judges is better of course buying a few judges is way cheaper than lobbying congress or subverting an entire agency
the federalist society will say “ here ’s how you vote ” and that will be it
and they ’ll only take the cases that allow them to implement conservative policies it ’s no problem at all for them as long as they maintain their majority
now thomas can really make some money especially with the ruling on gifts after political favors
i heard in 2017 the arc of history is long and bends towards justice i like to think that is true but i do n’t like to think about how much farther we have left to travel from it before reversing
this hedging is precisely why you will be smelling open air pits of your loved ones ' decomposing bodies the republic is dead the following cases are just to provide the legal framework for genocide hope this helps
just like an impetuous child ’s demands
what if their army enforces the ruling oh right
yes you 're right let 's let congress members who have no scientific education or insight whatsoever to determine what constitutes as clean water while the definition of clean water is ever evolving this ruling is a joke edit let congress make the law that water needs to be clean then let the scientists and folks educated in the water field determine what that means i would hope this ruling leads to congress just enacting a law giving some of these departments to have ambiguity in determining such things
i do n’t know how anyone thought that was a good way to set up the highest court in the land they should literally be forced to do their job unless sick and they should have a special section of the government they ca n’t touch and watches every penny they own and every move they make
unless the supreme court says a president is completely immune
i ’m hoping he ’s going through decades of sentencing guidelines with an airtight case to hand down 15 20 years based on his obstruction and contempt during the proceedings
joe looked good in nc today getting over that headcold i think he was sharp and we saw that toothy grin a few times he was getting some energy from the crowd for sure and sounded a lot better today
they are playing this in a way that dewires as many brainwashed people as possible they are slow roasting trump and his legacy to ensure when he goes to prison even his followers ca n't ignore he belongs there i guarantee the epstein papers get released at some strategic time before early voting starts
may i present you with the televised nixon v kennedy debate
i am not sure why you repeat this so what it has no bearing on regulating things that have been regulated for decades this is an undoing
dems taking control of both houses of congress then changing their rules to get rid of supermajorities then expanding the court
there is simply no reasonable path to that outcome the word ' realistically is there for a reason proposing a theoretically possible outcome as an abstract thought experiment is a far cry from actually seeing a 20 point swing in multiple red states which is what would have to happen we could unlock the secrets of near light speed travel by november i 'd give it the same odds
democrats can not possibly win enough senate seats to do such a thing it ’ll be extremely hard to just keep 50 seats
i mean we could invent speed of light travel by november essentially the same odds we are n't going to see either of them happen in the near future
constitutionally it only takes a majority to increase the seats to say 13 there are other excuses but a willful majority alone can do anything not here
the epa was started because so many chemicals were being dumped in the chicago river that the river caught fire multiple times in a year getting rid of the epa means you 're in favor of having rivers that catch on fire
who thought it was a good idea for lifetime appointments well the same people who thought enslaving other people was aok too that who
in that case it is year zero of emperor biden ’s reign
they would have to say a former president is immune from prosecution for crimes he committed before he was even elected and having nothing to do with his official duties i wo n’t put much past this court but there is just no way they make a ruling that insane
i might be mistaken but was n't the trial in ny about something that trump did before he became president so it ca n't be covered by immunity due to being president and currently he 's not president either
it would n't apply to the ny state case the it 's a state offence committed before he entered office
not immune from state crimes
i know how to tell the truth joe biden today
that 's good today 's joe should have been yesterday 's joe had joe won the debate it would have made his election easier in a ideal world
those voters are all long dead the media landscape and impact of television is wildly different today
again theoretical scenarios and thought experiments are n't reality had the democrats re organized after biden 's inauguration built a succession plan and prosecuted the daylights out of the insurrectionists immediately we may have had a chance but they hired a republican ag they put him in place because they knew he would n't do anything about it they foolishly thought the battle was over they tried to brand biden as some kind of hero when they should have been focused on building a candidate for 2024 no one was thinking long term no one in democratic party leadership had the vision or the will to think strategically at a time when we really needed it it 's too bad because that window is closed it 's a whole new fight now it 's no longer just a wannabe dictator and deluded followers it 's a court that has asserted itself as de facto rulers of the united states
gorsuch 's mother was the director of the epa during the reagan administration she attempted to dismantle it from within her legacy remains with us republicans have always sided with moneyed interests why does nearly 50 % of this country feel as if they will assist them they do n't care about the people or the environment as long as a company can get wealthy from it and the right wing justices can get a payday they are happy
to be fair lifetime was a hell of a lot shorter back when it was set up still a stupid idea even then but not the mind bogglingly stupid one it 's become
no the ruling will be that trump and only trump is immune it ’ll be a one time non precedent setting deal
the dems would never do that they do n’t have a killer instinct
sure seems that ’s the direction the court is headed
do n’t be so naive they will make up a away
he looks fantastic in the transcripts but he was mumbly and stammering a bit and quite subdued on the screen it was not a good look but there 's still time to overcome one bad night
it 's disingenuous to make a statement that televised debates have never had an effect on a presidential election the chairs from that debate are on display in the democracy exhibit at the smithsonian 's national museum of american history for that reason
it 's not though in the 30s and 40s the general public did n't know how sick fdr was television and media made elections a personality contest rather than an issues contest that is how jfk won that is how reagan won that is honestly how clinton and obama won we need good leaders who are personable able to communicate i remember watching a speech from hrc she 's a pretty brilliant person but she cannot connect with the voter obama and clinton could biden used to i know that aoc and whitmer and buttigieg can but we have stop with these legacy picks when the republicans can get 40 % with the stupidest greediest idiot in the country because he occasionally comes up with a good sound bite for his base
the court has no means to enforce its decisions it requires voluntary compliance see trail of tears
it was n't that much shorter the reason historic life expectancy is so low is because child mortality rates were enormous
a lifetime in slavery is still a lifetime in slavery no matter how long that may be
only presidents who do n’t win the popular vote are immune to consequences that way it only covers republicans
i know right freaking joke
they probably will just pointing out that they should n't be able to absolve him of state crimes via immunity those chuckleheads will find some way to save him
excuse me trump “ everyone agrees with the great things i did with abortion ” biden “ illegals killed a woman ” wha
that shits in a museum somewhere oh hell now i know it ’s important to young people
they ’re saying maybe the founders did n’t expect the supreme court justices to live so long the reality is there were long lived people back then the founders just expected people to be more patriotic and decent it ’s pretty much impossible to set up a system of government that is asshole proof ours is just wayyy more asshole resistant than the monarchy they were splitting away from still requires people to act in good faith and with compassion to function well
that 's not even remotely what i was referring to i was talking about the fact that lifespans being lower meant that the turnover rate for justices would have been higher since they simply would n't live as long
it ’s a very slippery slope
if they did ny should tell them to piss off try sbd come break him out yourselves and we ’ll arrest you for attempting a prison break
yeah i get it the founders were n’t perfect i agree using this same logic maybe they thought a lifetime in slavery was n’t as bad too because people lived such markedly shorter lives it ’s pathetic all around to keep an idiotic system just because that ’s the way some fuckwads in the last set it up
well more so the founders did n’t intend for the supreme court to be the final arbiter of what ’s constitutional they ’d think that it would be a give and take between them and congress they did a crazy power grab as the first courts were heavily slanted towards the federalists as washington nominated the entire first court the federalists would be out of power relatively quickly and jeffersonians had to be stopped so the court did so scotus has been a bullshit pro corporate pro wealthy pro white supremacy for most of its existence lifetime appointments in themselves are an instance concept that is a holdover from royal courts that should ’ve been redone to be more democratic
that 's actually very true i was being a bit glib with the lifetime aspect of it but the biggest problem is definitely that they expected people to operate in good faith within the system they seem to have figured that if there were any bad actors they 'd have been the outliers and would easily be dealt with with the system of impeachment unfortunately they apparently never imagined that an entire party would stop acting in good faith and start using the system against the rest
i never accused you of making any point whatsoever the founders were fuckwads
interesting thank you is john mayer really your dad
my b i forgot the s which would have maintained the same vibe with your comment above it
i see the party establishment steadily circling the wagons as expected
what is next a bunch of rallies that nobody is going to see from now until at least september the momentum is now against us that 's 3 months of bad momentum unless we spark something the american people are begging for someone younger why not listen to them i 'm tired of voting against trump i want to vote for somebody
please let this old man step down the debate was the nail in the coffin he ’s cooked
seems like what ’s next ’ is blame the networks moderators media and cross their fingers with democracy at stake
a glass of warm milk and a nap jill can read him a bedtime story
i ’m watching his nc rally on tv and biden is fucking crushing it and he ’s bashing the shit out of trump and the crowd is going crazy for him it was a bad debate what i ’m witnessing like right now a very different performance do n’t believe me switch in the tv right now
nobody is going to watch a rally everyone watched the debate he blew it when it mattered
keep telling yourself that chief dementia often has alternating states of cognition not voting for either major candidate is the only acceptable response
except everyone did lol its being played on repeat
he ’s been going at it for an hour straight and has n’t made a single mistake even though he clearly has the remnants of a cough it now makes sense that he indeed had a cold during the debate because he ’s killing it you can hate him all you want but this ai n’t dementia on display
but that does n’t fucking matter the debate mattered and it was a fuck up of a millenia his campaign is high af on hopium if they think this can be fixed
as is this sub lol i ’ve never seen an entire sub of 8 m members intentionally break itself because they ca n’t cope with the fact that it was a shitshow also the analysis of someone ’s mental capacity by a layperson means nothing everyone who knows knows that dude is demented as fuck
his rally performance the next day just showed he had a cold during the debate and had a bad night
all of the filmed quotes he lied about should be broadcast in every form of media showing the lies to the biggest audience possible magats do n’t care
but but 19 people said he never said that nineteen people damnit unfortunately for trump his chief of staff general john kelly who quoted him was n't one of them
if you ’re fanatical enough to go to a trump rally you ’re voting for him regardless waste of money by the dnc should invest it in getting the geriatrics off the ticket instead guess they learned nothing from 2016
any veteran who votes for trump is more than just a loser and sucker trump refused military service because of bone spurs even though he played sports in college he called those killed in action at an american military cemetery in france losers and suckers insulted a gold star family for speaking out against him and blamed another gold star family for his contraction of covid told senator mcclain who was 5 year pow heroes do n't get capture refused to have his picture taken with recovering service members who were amputees saying it was a bad look for him he defrauded over a military dollars in donations from many veterans the trump foundation was order shut down and had to pay two million dollars in damages to various military and veteran charities these actions alone are enough to make me not vote for trump
was trump high last night
i wish the dnc would remind people of a reason to vote for the democratic candidate other than not trump they have to stop being so ineffectual if we 're never going to get a better choice
none of us should forget what he also said about john mccain being a pow or his put downs toward our gold star families he truly hates our veterans no matter how he protests he does not
good they need to do this every time he crawls out from under his rock what a pos
why not release it on the internet where everyone can view it
that was biden 's job last night what we saw is indicative of his average performance and the average is n't very good
yeah lol that never happened but keep playing the pearl clutching emotion card
he ’s only in it for the power it gives him wake da fuq up he had never cared about anything but himself i guy who would fuck his own daughter because she ’s attractive gtfoh
i really really really hate this guy military vet 1969 1971
the problem is videos do n’t prove anything anymore it ’s 2024 it ’s time the veil is finally pulled down in america it does n’t matter who the candidates are or even this “ gotcha ” bs about things from their past whoever is backed by more billionaires i ’m voting for the other and it ’s crystal clear that democrats are the new elite globalist establishment biden had zero explanation or defense towards the valid accusation of open borders the strength and influence the cartels have now or the amount of fentanyl and overdose deaths on our streets except lying for three years that our border was closed those actions have real life consequences in the inner cities crime job competition our tax dollars being spent housing competition while in shortage drug and human trafficking mostly things that are easily blown off by affluent whites and mainstream media as “ fear peddling ” because it does n’t affect them and we are gon na take our country back for all of us minorities this fall who are tired of being either squeezed into servant slave classes or forced into lives of crime america is awake now y’all white elites can keep being “ woke ” it never did anything except signal your virtue anyway
lest we forget trump is a lying little dick
more of them hoax i see
we 're all sucker 's and losers if we think either of these 2 are going to make a difference about the sorry state we 're in
i do n’t think anyone outside of the people who already despise donald trump think he ever said this with no actual proof it seems like more obvious gas lighting i do n’t think it helps at all
i ’m i ’m obama and other historians they have to meet biden asap tell him to find his successor a winning ticket before the convention biden could easily be top 10 president all time if trump wins 2024 he would end up bottom 5 worse president along with trump
even a broken clock is right two times a day people who join the military are 100 % suckers
are they gon na show the whole video with context or do like the fine people both sides or mexicans are rapists clips where if you just look at the whole sentence you can see he did n't say what they 're pretending he said who am i kidding of course they wo n't then y' all wonder why dems are losing younger folks including minorities more and more
ok so either he said it or did n’t say it is there footage did biden say clap you stupid bastards directed at the military or not say it there ’s footage of that one all i am saying is there is a lot of purposeful misconstruing not a good look if you ’re trying to portray honesty against donald trump of all people do n’t believe me here are more examples of misconstruing and or selectively editing trumps words very fine people injecting bleach bloodbath illegals are vermin i can go on with actions objects russian collusion russian bounties taking control of the presidential vehicle the laptop and it ’s 51 cia operatives the lafayette square incident selling nuclear secrets banning abortion dumping the food into the koi pond in japan cmon guys at least try to have some integrity and you ’d defeat trump easily making shit up does you no favors i do n’t see rfk behaving that way
unfortunately there are too many people in japan who do n't notice trump 's lies even though this is a public and fair debate there are zero media reporters and commentators in japan who can point out trump 's lies one by one they just copy the comments from cnn
it 's not for the trump cult members though it 's for the people who are watched last night and are still on the fence
the dnc has performed as poorly as biden i ’m in pa and our airwaves are getting crushed by trump propaganda why are n’t we seeing j6 videos 24 7
his grandfather came here to avoid military service in his own country
show me proof where he said that exact quote and i vote for biden
there ’s no question he was but that is more about how his entire administration was privy to prescription med abuse it was reported that packs of 3 pills of whatever they needed were given out on trips and that a lot of the prescriptions were handed out and not reported that his cabinet members were open about their xanax use and alcohol stuff like that
anyone in an industry directly funded by tax payers should be drug tested our politicians should be held to the same welfare standards as regular people
he tried lowered insulin prices passed industry bill offered border bill if you take all the superficial bs out and read the debate on paper trump would look way worse but we me included are a superficial country sometimes
we all saw trump insult our military when he attacked our pows
why not apart from the fact that trump has a long history of saying offensive and disdainful things about the military his own chief of staff a retired four star marine general has publicly confirmed it after the story broke
yeah it ’s not like trump has a long history of saying stuff like this or there ’s a general who corroborates it nah i think the known liar is telling the truth this time
if you ’re being honest with yourself you know that donald trump said this
if trump wins in 2024 there will be no more america just another dictatorship in the world
getting housing healthcare and food paid for and a pension in a safe job that pays for travel plenty of promotion opportunities and paid training as well as fully paying for school the vast majority do not see combat i do n’t see how they are suckers
whole lot of suckers in my family got their mds paid for by the us navy and were stationed in hellholes like honolulu hawaii pensacola florida coronado island in san diego ca and the isle of crete for their troubles
man even in “ context ” it ’s all pretty disgusting lol dems far outweigh reps it ’s why reps have n’t won a popular vote in decades now electoral system is literally the only thing saving them
yes trump had a great showing in detroit from the minority vote just as believable as replacing biden
you have to understand that the people on this subreddit are majority far left they have decided that anyone who runs against trump is good and that anything trump says or does is bad whether it is or not they will fuel the right 's argument about fake news and things being rigged by believing anything refusing to do their own research and exagerating how bad things actually are if you read the fact checks after last nights debate a lot of the checks do n't even address what he said or they ignore facts completely it 's why there are so many disenfrachised voters who would have normally voted left that are most likely voting 3rd party or abstaining completely
well i ’m not trying to be dismissive but certain areas are n’t worth the budget they need to captivate an audience it ’s really return on investment throwing some biden ads in deep red areas might not sway much given the conservative echo chambers not sure where you are in pa but it can be really isolated
because democrats are weak and do n’t play to win they play to fundraise
here are just a few articles the alleged losers and suckers statement was made and was also corroborated by retired 4 star united states marine corp general former homeland security secretary and white house chief of staff under trump why would i lie it 's public knowledge that he made such statements
i guess it depends on your opinion of the veracity of trump 's then chief of staff general john kelly quoting him in the atlantic a person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat or spend years being tortured as pows are all suckers ’ because there is nothing in it for them ' kelly said of trump a person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because it does n’t look good for me ’ a person who demonstrated open contempt for a gold star family for all gold star families on tv during the 2016 campaign and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in america ’s defense are losers ’ and would n’t visit their graves in france ” which when you stop to consider is actually even worse
just an example of both easy access and addiction being common in the gop
the accomplishments are great but they 're superficial if we ca n't keep them going if the democratic party were effective we 'd have the house and the senate have you read the transcript biden reads like trump was talking it 's embarrassing and all the other countries are watching the republicans are evil and the democrats lose they put a mid 40 's poc with half a platform and a moderate vp on the ticket there 's no contest but we ca n't do that because they 'd have to start running on a platform more meaningful than not evil
he attacked one pow and it was a terrible moment of petty revenge it ’s one of the character traits that even gopers do n’t like about him
the other 19 people there said it never happened from everything i see the troops love trump
19 witnesses said it did n’t happen whose the one who is dishonest
a whole lotta people got their legs blown off and murdered people in foreign countries for the dumbest reasons while your self serving family got an easy ride on taxpayers backs is another way of looking at it
good direct democracy is a terrible idea anyway
lol all the downvotes just trying to help y' all realise you 're in as much of a cult as the maga fanatics are
wtf are you talking about the far left is among the biggest critics of biden and is pushing 3rd party voting how are you going to blame the far left for vote blue no matter who
believe me i get it i ’ll offer a hand to anyone far on one side or the other or try to tell them they ’re being lied to gaslit the emperor has no clothes though it is a fools errand it ’s truly plato ’s allegory of the cave politics deserves a discourse not a general silencing or unfounded disbelief of a different opinion the shadows on the wall are n’t really the source of the images seen if they ca n’t come to terms with that i wish them good luck as they ’ll need it
that is n't evidence that is hearsay
i want video audio recording not articles
john kelly also stated that trump barred all recuperating military personal at the military hospital in the dc area from having official visits to the white house as was the custom under the previous presidents kelly also confirm trump quit visiting military cemeteries while he was part of that staff one of the reason why john kelly was fired and unanimously tossed out of the white house was that he tried approached trump about toning his attitude and rhetoric towards the military and those that served down but like you said it depends on the veracity of trump inner circle member and former homeland security secretary john kelly but i do want to believe john kelly as a former veteran myself
not going to get any push back from me the senate will always be a hard nut for dems to crack it ’s the power of a landowner as each state gets 2 regardless of how many people eventually that does n’t matter as we get more populated which is why you can see it ’s 50 50 they poked around with the idea of other candidates last go round they could n’t beat trump they lose the crossover voters anyway it ’s a moot point there is zero chance they are pulling biden it ’s him or trump in november
1 read the transcript it was an attack on the military 2 it is never acceptable for a coward to insult military members it is anti american
link to those supposed 19 people because the only thing i saw was several independent news outlets claiming that at least 5 people from the event admitted hearing him say it and that was before kelly went public oh and this is trump 's public quote about general mark milley former chair of the joint chiefs of staff the nation 's highest ranking military officer “ mark milley is a loser who shamed us in afghanistan and elsewhere ” hmm what are the chances of him calling anyone else in the military a loser i wonder
speaking of suckers got a source for those “ 19 ”
yes ignore a retired military general that trump hand picked who also had a son die in combat he ’s really got a reason to lie about it
pretty hard to confirm the absence of speech troops loving trump is an entirely different situation our military is n’t exactly a funnel of our best and brightest minds it ’s often the only real option for betterment from poverty situations
i ’m sure they ’re completely devoted and willing to lie about anything to save him
there was no there mentioned it was in private conversations with his chief of staff retired four star general john kelly
can a person witness an event they did n’t witness it seems like a bonehead defense i could find 100 people who did n’t witness it happening
yeah those witnesses do n’t exist meanwhile there ’s a four star general who corroborates
stop spamming lies about 19 witnesses in addition to the four people from the trump administration with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day in the original report another unnamed senior defense department official with firsthand knowledge and a senior us marine corps officer who had been told about it at that time both confirmed trump 's losers and suckers remarks to the associated press then trump 's own chief of staff and a 4 star general confirmed it but as long as a convicted felon and pathological liar denies saying it i guess we 'll never know “ he ’s not a war hero he was a war hero because he was captured i like people who were n’t captured ” donald trump 2015
you do realize you have a choice of jobs and again being in the military even in the infantry is a relatively safe job vs something like being a roofer or meat packing lineman agriculture or even a trade like an electrician who all have wrecked bodies from being in awkward cramp positions their entire career and are broken by 60 and that ’s the “ easy ” trade
hey at least after their easy rides through eight years of unpaid post grad work and study they were around to put those poor suckers back together after they got their legs blown off oh and deliver their wives ' babies and keep their kids from dying of pertussis and run their hospitals and the national health research services after caring for the wounded and dying on both sides of those stupid shooting wars i 'm wondering what did you do for your fellow countrymen in your twenties through thirties
one vote per person is a “ bad idea ” while giving different areas more or less voting power is a “ good idea ” we ’re about seven months away from project 2025 because of the faulty system we have in place as it is i ’m not sure using a populous vote is a bad thing
sure when biden tries to steal an election and have us storm the capitol in a pointless attempt to stop the certification then come talk to us as of now espousing the same nonsense maga does and believes i ask again how ’d that minority turn out in detroit go for trump polling showing a massive shift in minority voters for trump right
i 'll take the word of retired 4 star marine corp general john kelly who was in trumps inner circle as the white chief of staff and as secretary of homeland security i 'll his word over that of trump or what ever you believe
go do you on research i 'm not your fucking research assistant
i gave you links to the story sorry if you do n't like them i am sorry if you ca n't comprehend that it was corroborate by someone in trump 's inner circle is that all you got is the sucker loser statement he and his fucking phony trump foundation defrauded veterans out of millions of dollars and you 're okay with this but you want a direct quote for suckers losers your reasoning is shallow and pedantic at best
and i 'm going to vote for biden but a lot of folks wo n't and it 's going to cost us everything the republicans keep the senate because democrats do n't have the straight ticket propaganda machine that faux news provides the republicans take msnbc they could have spent all night talking about trump lying women 's healthcare low crime rates and anything else instead they are talking about biden the dnc needs to get it together with messaging and democratic politicians need to start using fox and friends
19 to 1 yea i ’m ignoring the 1 that trumped forced out
i think they take an oath to defend thr constitution not sure if that includes the president or not
i ’m supposed to believe the guy who was in charge of gitmo is telling the truth
there 's pros and cons to each system if you 're forming a country and you 're a city with 1000 people and you form the country with a couple villages of 50 100 people each then with direct democracy they would never have majority they would never have a say for their own issues that 's why it 's a republic they would never enter into an agreement of forming a country if they could not realistically be represented in power it 's too big a topic for a reddit post though but that 's the starting point
sure pretend democrats have not also in the past called for violence and democrats totally never denied elections before right please
or how about the time dems were antivaxx until biden won and it became their vaccine it 's all a game and you 're being played
who is the far left lol
i did and it is a lie that is my point
i do n't need story 's i need video proof or audio i do n't need opinions the same one who got fired is the same one who spread it so it does not hold weight judging by what trump already did for the military and how he is behaving show me the how the trump foundation defrauded i did not hear this
i am sure we both hope that is not the case i do n’t know seems odd they would change candidates midstream that would feel to me like a shift start putting other candidates in place newsom is polarizing and untested in a national election no one is even suggesting kamala lot of risk in all directions but we if we all go and vote we keep our democracy
and ignoring trump who has a history of defaming veterans holy fuck
again link to 19 people supposedly denying it until you miraculously come up with one i 'm gon na call bs especially considering that not one but four different anonymous sources confirmed it before kelly did
it ’s hilarious that you think protesting the systemic abuse of police is calling for violence got any more failed gotchas
no it ’s not a rushed and untested vaccine was the concern and that ’s weirdly what republicans seized on when the vaccine came out remember when trump took credit for it too and encouraged everyone to get vaccinated
at some point the left began calling anyone who was right leaning as far right and in return the right began referring to people on the left as far left the ones calling for 3rd parties like you mentioned are n't measurable since they tend to want a drastically different government and do n't fit with either party the easiest example of the far left would be this subreddit since they are just the other side of the coin to the maga republicans with their hate and willingness to ignore facts
a lie from his own chief of staff a four star general there are only two possibilities 1 trump said it overwhelmingly likely 2 trump hired a guy who would tell a flagrant lie that insults millions who have fought and died for their country for no discernible upside making trump a fuck awful manager and judge of character
hard to hear when you plug your ears when people are giving you documented evidence of things you do n't like
i would go with buttigieg so when fux news starts throwing homophobic slurs it wakes up the centrist republicans
your using a strawman i ’m talking about specific event
snopes has a good summary updated a few hours ago tldr they could n't confirm it with kelly and several unnamed sources saying they heard it first or second hand and multiple administration officials present with trump on the trips denying
i ’m talking about who to believe someone that ’s served in the military had family die in combat or a president who has a history of doing the things you ’re saying he did n’t not to mention his staff admitting to congress that they do n’t owe the press the truth when defending trump
i 've read it too the only thing they say is that there 's no evidence of an audio or video recording of the remarks in question nor was there any documentation such as transcripts or presidential notes to independently confirm or deny the alleged quotes ' authenticity which is not surprising considering the context in which the remarks were made but then they also list all the sources that supported the claim four anonymous staff members with firsthand knowledge an anonymous senior official with the u s department of defense with firsthand knowledge a senior u s marine corps officer who was told about trump ’s comments on the day and gen john kelly who finally came out and denounced trump 's remarks publicly last year i mean given trump 's history which again includes about a dozen of similar allegations and such gems as disparaging pows and calling the nation 's highest ranking military officer a loser in public and the number of firsthand sources from his own administration confirming the story albeit anonymously one'd have to be pretty naive or have cult like maga mindset to believe the convicted felon over everybody else
the great part about all of this is you can believe whatever you want
clearly you are trump ca n't even talk about the weather at his inauguration without lying about it now you believe him
i can and i believe trump with his history made that statement you ’re welcome to believe otherwise
next go and ban trump from lying about everything
frankly that seems like a terrible overreach of the legislative branch although now with chevron dead and buried the executive branch has no power to decide anything on its own anymore
does nt the house have better things to be considering at this time sure feels like a convenient distraction or is it more of a ' just shovel a whole lot of stuff through while nobody is paying attention ' kind of thing or maybe its congressional puppets dancing on the end of donorpac strings kind of hard to tell imo one of the last things that we need a new law for
so whose stats are they gon na use israel statistics are just as unreliable they always investigate themselves and find no wrongdoing they have been reporting numbers that are n’t even close to the 40k dead
mike we need to waste more money and time suggestions do n’t worry if biden will veto we know that he will
ca n’t wait for the pro zionist brigade to downvote bash anything in support of the valuation of human lives outside of their own and their clients of course
they have banned mentioning trump 's felony convictions fucking republicans hate truth and reality
they do n't want to use any numbers because those might make them grow a conscience and that stops the war machine look at that the two dem sponsors of this amendment have aipac as their top lobbyists
un reports state that the 40 000 dead could be exaggerated by as much as 12 000
you mean anti jihadi terrorist brigade i used to use the term “ zionist ” but no longer do as it ’s lost its meaning in recent months i ’m an atheist liberal living in california and i ’ve been called a zionist for supporting the idea that hamas does n’t have the right to exist as a military or government entity it ’s as if october 7th never happened and a genocidal death cult is now the good guys the moral confusion is mind boggling
why would zionists downvote a post about banning hamas propaganda
and they are ok with lying about biden reminds me of this quote if you stop telling lies about us we will stop telling the truth about you no democrats with any integrity would not put up with that ban
12 000 people who are 100 % women and children according to the gazan health ministry they ’re cooking the books clearly
that number is a complete fabrication the 12 000 is an estimate by the gaza health agency the number is said to be of undiscovered bodies under rubble but most of this rubble ’ they talk about is buildings that were destroyed after the idf took over an area buildings destroyed in the process of destroying the tunnel network throughout gaza
old biden may know how to tell the truth but millions of us wanted him to also fight the lies
why did n’t he do this last night now frumpy knows his weakness just carpet bomb him with lies
wish biden could have targeted trumps lies during the debate last night
where was this energy last night maybe the debates should be in the afternoon or something lol
he seemed very hesitant during the debate are you up for this challenge or not because being up for it means slamming 3 red bulls before the debate and practicing like your campaign depends upon it
everyone should watch his nc rally from today difference is night and day in his performance quote video snippet president biden i do n't walk as easy as i used to i do n't speak as smoothly as i used to i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong i know how to do this job i know like millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up full rally
in order to tell the truth you have to first actually finish a thought or sentence
this is the wrong reaction to last night
can he tell the truth that he 's far too old for another 4 years in one the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world and that he and his family 's ego is going to give us another trump presidency when literally any other candidate would 've shot down trump on the debate stage last night appreciate all he has done and it 's great that he can read loudly from a teleprompter but it 's time to ride off into the sunset the country hangs in the balance
and where the fuck was this guy last night
but do you know how to confront the lies
unfortunately trump ca n't truth from lies and that 's hampering his view reality
just where prey tell in the motherfuck was that energy last night
“ my christian catholic faith taught me the morales of telling the truth ” call out these “ christians ” for their constant lies
politicians lie it ’s an unspoken part of it biden bragging he knows how to tell the truth matters very little if his cognitive skills would make him forgetful anyway
just step down joe you wo n’t win this
knows how to tell the truth just not face he needs to pass the torch to another dem for the sake of the country
trumps lies are inexplicable and biden is much more honest but the democratic party have been lying hiding a major factor for voters which is the health of the nominee the cognitive health of the president should not be obscured or hidden from the voters which bidens inner circle and many dems must have known
someone should start telling him the truth
all this talk about replacing biden is bullshit the entire media owes this man an apology
i 'm not sure joe knows how to say anything after sunset sundowners seems to be his life now
not helpful if you die mid sentence
alright he factory reset his pfizer 5 g bill gates chip
newsom is almost neck and neck with biden in current vegas odds to be president and they ’re both long shots behind trump that was not the case before last night ’s debate before the debate trump 150 biden 162 newsom 2000 after the debate trump 175 biden 350 newsom 550 anybody saying things will be the same soon and the debate will be forgotten are still living in a fantasy land biden is barely mentally functioning as a human let alone as a president
he should have bowed out and there should have been a primary he is selfish like rbg
guy is really grasping it seems trump really outclassed him last night
let me know when he corrects all his lies from last night and about hunter from the last debate i mean since he tells the truth
i would not feel safe with biden as president of the united states
biden is one of the most infamous liars ever to hold office
that picture makes him look like he just sent back his soup because it was n’t hot enough
we all know biden could n’t have said that he ’s not that coherent
but millions of us wanted him to also fight the lies you ca n't when your opponent lies with every sentence and spews them non stop you 're not given any tools or time to counter these these debates are pointless theater especially when everyone can just lie
and thus the gish gallop was created or to put it another way a lie can be half way around the world before the truth can get its pants on
it ’s up to us to fight the evil
honest question how do we make our voices heard
biden lied plenty himself last night no military service killed under his watch
why did n’t he do this last night exactly my thought too this is the biden that needed to be at the debate last night
the debate could have been 3 hours long and they still would have run out of time for that
i guess he had a cold after all
sundowning plus no teleprompters plus being in a room that is 100 percent engineered for his pleasure not an ounce of hostility in the air
that ’s fine but most voters are n’t on this sub and are n’t going to see this the impression that most voters got was from last night ’s performance unfortunately
he looked significantly better he did after the debate at the rally last night too idk what happened maybe it ’s the lack of a teleprompter i ca n’t figure it out
judicious crown slimy impossible ad hoc fact deer sparkle disagreeable chief this post was mass deleted and anonymized with
to be fair its a lot easier to talk when you have a speech pre prepared and a teleprompter to look off of
i ’m good i ’ve seen all i need to see
is n’t that a sign of sundowning
watch the debate that was elder abuse plan and simple
the entire media is biden old yeah but what about all the usual insane stuff trump said how did he normalize being crazy
the betters had trump at 33 % chance of winning after he lost in 2020 up until his coup failed afterwards it went down to 20 % until the bets all had to be closed out do nt give any weight to the betting sites these are n't the brightest gamblers in the world
really literally 99 % of the things that spewed out of his face were flat out lies there 's zero class in that
he beat him in cognitive presence would nt bring the word class into this lol
the sea was angry that day my friends
it ’s literally trumps strategy and always has been throw out so much bullshit there is no possible way even a man in his prime could address it all especially not in the time given
you can appear to try if you up to it
that 's true i just saw one pass me and i 'm on a plane
i think he already knows what most of us are thinking so we can only hope he responds well
right trump lied more but biden got a few whoopers in and honestly duh politicians lie that should n’t be shocking to anyone unless this is like their first election cycle
biden did have one outright lie that you mentioned and 3 or 4 where he stretched the truth in comparison trump had 3 or 4 lies where they could be stretched to be true while everything else was blatantly false these are not the same
he did say that but for the many excuses given for the crazy stuff trump says i 'll throw one out there for biden he misspoke lol
hey this man beat medicare show some respect
he was probably reading off a teleprompter and who knows who wrote the words but i doubt it was him without a teleprompter he ’s startled he still will get my vote but i thought he should have had a family member take him off the debate stage back in 2020 and 4 years later it was sad but this is what the democratic elites give us in 2016 they forced clinton down our throats and that gave us trump now we ’re with the old guy the elites gave us granted better than the alternative but is n’t it time we had someone younger to be enthused about these boomers just refuse to give up the power way past their use by date and i ’m a boomer
yeah ok but biden last night was barely able to speak even in a place full of supports the difference is insane they seems like 2 different people lol
dems fail over and over to realize that a presidential election is a popularity contest full stop always has been back to the times of the greeks and romans it did n't matter that nixon was more experienced he looked sweaty and gross on tv it did n't matter what dukakis ' policies were he looked like a goof it did n't matter that gore had bona fides w felt relatable it did n't matter that hilary was such an experienced statesperson the gop had spent 25 years vilifying her over and over again dems fall back to policy and experience yet they fail the charisma check it should be no surprise that the only democratic presidents to do really well in their presidential elections dating back to jfk were charismatic charming and above all else excellent speakers and communicators both on a personal level and while doing speeches to large crowds clinton and obama above everything else inspired you they made you feel good about who you were voting for even if you disagreed with them on some things they felt in touch they felt like they understood us and conversely the gop has lost when they 've ran on policy and experience against someone more charismatic bush 1 vs clinton dole vs clinton mccain and romney i fear that we 've fallen into the exact same situation again biden got lucky trump fumbled covid had he just let the cdc do their thing we 'd be in his second term right now but trump did fumble and biden did win that does n't mean biden is the right guy now it means he won the last election and nothing else before anyone says any shit i volunteer and contribute to biden and will continue to if he 's still the nominee he 's been sound policy wise and has accomplished a shit ton with a congress actively trying to prevent any good news for him and a media hellbent on another nail biter election it 's unfortunate that elections are n't just about policy and experience but we 're simply monkeys casting lots and the overwhelming majority of monkeys sure do fall for shit like optics and gut feelings
and the other part that people are going to see is all the social media clips biden opposition is going to push clips of his performance hard across social media and that is what people will see
that or he needs an audience to feel fired up or both
yeah at this point i just want someone that i 'm confident could hit like 20 % of their free throws
i want my president to be a non convicted felon who does n't want to be a dictator who does n't constantly lie and want women to have no rights enjoy trump ass
consistent what even obama had a shit debate when romney ran against him
yes i too want a consistent criminal fascist liar and sexual abuser for president
to also be fair debates require prepared soundbites as well
it 's also easier to gish gallop bullshit like trump during such a debate instead of even trying to answer the question which is why he was percieved more agile than sleepy joe ok and to be fair biden was just lame on his own as well but that 's not my point my point is if i was just given the comments about his performance yesterday and the video from the rally above i 'd have to ask if we talk about the same person
yes biden is sundowning hard and everyone is making excuses for it
it 's in comparison trump pandered to his base and did great at that biden could n't pander to his base because he seem to be struggling to just finish a thought or sentence one is par for the course trump just being trump and that 's why his supporters like him in the first place the other is not par for the course biden embarrassed democrats yesterday
the problem is he said rose lies very confidently
i 'm going to assume the 99 % is a statistic you just made up on the spot also language matters i would be willing to bet there were very few flat out lies some exaggerations disingenuous statements misleading facts sure both sides were guilty of that but flat out lies i 'd reckon those did n't occur nearly as much on either side
i 'd venture to say that cognitive presence is a pretty necessary trait if you wish to be competitive in a debate
i feel like the way you handle this strategy is by ignoring the individual lies and addressing the lying behavior in whole
no you really ca n’t and trying was a major part of why he looked bad on the stage it ’s too much bullshit for anyone to meaningfully respond to in 60 seconds and if biden just said “ well all of that was a lie ” the “ news ” mostly shill bots would be hounding him for being scared to engage
biden lies by mistake trump lies on purpose biden lies 1 % of the time by mistake trump lies 99 % of the time on purpose
lying is pathological for trump he lies for no reason nobody regardless of politics should be let off the hook for lying but when it is pathological it is worse
this is exactly right that clip of his epic meltdown where he ended up muttering about beating medicare will be in every republican ad until the election
they should we all told you guys that biden was a one termer that ’s literally why people voted for him no one listened and now there ’s a full on panic because people are realizing he ’s a disaster and is in big trouble guess y all should ’ve listened to us the polls or literally anything other than smelling your own farts you reap what you sow
it could be that joe has always been that guy who feeds off the crowd he is at his best when he can look his audience in the eye and connect with them on a personal level it ’s an old school politics kind of thing that is when he is best

no offense but the felon thing is bs i mean come on hillary clinton was charged and found guilty of the same items plus a few more worse items with destroying evidence and she got a misdemeanor and fine every business and person out there inflates their net worth and the loans that were taken out were paid back in full with interest we can all agree the felonies are nothing more than a political ploy i guarantee if you went back to every president in the last 30 years you will find a lot of these with their campaigns now trump is not a guy i ’d go to lunch with and hang out because i think he is arrogant as hell and needs to stop talking but biden lied his ass off too the dictator comment is null and void because that ca n’t happen and wo n’t ever be possible the big issue is we have a current president that does n’t know if it ’s tuesday or thursday yet has our country in his hands we look extremely weak to foreign countries if we had to get into negotiations he would n’t even be able to speak if it ’s not written down on a screen he can perform i think both candidates needs to go but unfortunately that is not the cards we are dealt i would take trump over biden because at the end of the day i was much better off under trump than i am under biden
obama 's shit debate was in a completely different league than whatever yesterday was that was a loss in a normal one on one debate yesterday was n't a debate but one senile dude lying through his teeth and another dude struggling to remember where he was
what debate was even comparable to what happened last night there 's a difference between being off your a game and geriatrics shit show we saw last night

i 'll stand by flat out lies and i 'll add purposefully and deliberately
i think a major reason he looked bad is he ’s losing a step i agree the lying liar does n’t help but these two debated 4 years ago and trump was a liar then compare last night the a debate from 2020 and you ca n’t use “ trump lied a lot ” to excuse the difference between the two bidens
the same can be said for trump
capable of running the country like the last 4 years
tell me what biden has n't done tell me what trump has done for you biden got my student loans forgiven he is not as useless as this bad faith troll above me seems to think
it 's basically that hillary clinton 3am phone call commercial from 2008 it did n't work against obama because everyone could see he was up to the task imagine a massive emergency at 3am and biden barely knows where he 's at or what 's going on the same goes for trump he 'd shit the bed just as hard
what actions in the last 4 years have led you to think he is n't capable
that is n't quite true the crime that raises them to felonies is election fraud because he did it to influence the election
no offense but the felon thing is bs i mean come on hillary clinton was charged and found guilty of the same items plus a few more worse items with destroying evidence and she got a misdemeanor and fine trump was charged with 34 counts of falsification of business records in the first degree hillary was not charged with anything regarding business records same items my ass
point is that it was only one debate he does this again for the next one then worry
people are claiming he just had a cold he 's fine this denialism is going to lose us the election talk about several shades beyond frustration argh
could you elaborate on some of the top flat out lies that we 're told like the top 3 to you most egregious lies
but it was sad and disappointing
well if we ’re comparing the candidates to themselves from 4 years ago trump is definitely far worse off than biden trump said absolutely nothing of any substance all night at least last time he had some kind of platform this time he spent the night shrieking about how much he hates america and how great imaginary people say he is
trump seems to get too hyped up on the crowd he looked borderline tame at the debate without their energy to feed off of

if he does this in september he is 100 % losing and it 'll be too late to do anything about it
by then it 's too late to swap candidates i 'm convinced biden is n't winning this with someone anyone younger at least you have a chance against trump
1 everything he said about illegal aliens except for him being endorsed by the border patrol 2 everything he said about our exit from afghanistan which he negotiated 3 everything he said about his administration 's handling of the economy from taxes to covid to jobs inflation and revenue 4 everything he said about ukraine
i 'll add on here some more specifics but if you 're really curious there a dozens of sites where they fact checked and at best only 3 or 4 things trump said are remotely true 1 late term and post birth abortions being a thing not sure i should have to explain how absolutely absurd this is 2 that russia never would have invaded ukraine under his watch they literally did he was impeached for blocking aid from ukraine against their fight from russia 3 that the rest of the world watched jan 6th and thought it was a great thing not sure i should have to explain this one either but trump is absolutely the laughing stock of the developed world unlike his claims otherwise the only world leaders that like him are dictators immigration
agreed cnn did a truly terrible job of moderating whatever that was supposed to be letting a conspiracy addled fascist talk shit on a national stage for 3 hours is a disgrace
sure but apparently a lot of people do n’t care if he has a platform they just want him to be angry do n’t get me wrong i ’m voting for biden but i ’m not gon na make excuses for last night i ’m also done talking about it because unless he drops out were are stuck with him and we need him to win so focusing on the obvious issues on display last night will do nothing to help that goal
my point is trump showed up with or without the crowd ’s energy why could n’t biden do the same
good point let re elect the guy that made abortion illegal that 'll fix it
economy is shit i 'm from europe and even i can look up economic metrics they 're the opposite of shit i think you 're able to use google just as well housing market is shit it 's shit all over the world that 's a systematic problem you think our european towns are any better lol job market is shit blatant lie salaries are shit depends who you ask abortion is illegal in so many states yeah i reeeeally want to see how you twist yourself into a pretzel blaming this one on biden homelessness is still a huge issue fair enough
can you be specific on any of those other than all caps everything the vast majority of americans tax burden did get better under trump when he doubled the standard deduction the afghanistan exit was indeed negotiated by trump and exiting afghanistan should 've been a good thing unfortunately it was directed by biden whose team made some critical errors along the way i understand if you just hate the guy but if your making bold claims that nearly 100 % of what he said was lie some specifics would be helpful
1 late term abortions are absolutely a thing in some states 6 states and d c have no limit the post birth thing has context to it directly attributing it the former governor of virginia and he went on to say that no one wants that republicans or democrats so it was very much an attack on specific politicians not democrats as a whole 2 russia invaded ukraine in 2022 3 did he actually say it was a great thing the riot itself i do n't remember the exact line you 're referring to but i 'm guessing it lack context where he probably said his speach rally that day was great or something and you just hsndcuffed it to the riot
could n’t care less what magats want they ’ll just find some other fascist to prop up after he chokes on a hamberder yes biden is old yes he ’s older than he was 4 years ago he ’s also been a great president and is exactly the leader we need right now the both sidesey hand wringing just reads as disingenuous
obama could ’ve codified it but it was n’t a “ legislative priority ” oops

he said the border was the safest ever under his administration and the most dangerous ever under biden simply not true he said biden discontinued his border policies and everything has gone to hell simply not true biden 's policies are actually quite similar to or continuations of trump 's policies he blamed the democrats for bad border policy simply not true the republicans killed the last serious border policy bill both sides have sucked horribly on this issue but trump 's version is deliberately wrong he said his economic policies were successful they most definitely were not his 2 trillion dollar tax cuts during a strong economy led directly to the inflation we have now and enjoy your improved tax situation this year after your cuts sunset while the cuts for the rich and corporations do n't i 'll have to stick with everything on ukraine because it 's the only thing that fits
1 yes late term abortions are only a thing for when the baby is already dead or only going to survive days at best aborting healthy babies in late term is absolutely not a thing that happens on any normal basis period no woman wants to carry a healthy baby to full term just to abort it if you have a source to prove that that is n't just an activist 's opinion piece i 'd love to see it not to mention trump was also taking about after birth abortions as well not even sure what the fuck that is lastly he absolutely mentioned several times that democrats want late term and after term abortions either directly or indirectly 2 are you forgetting about crimea what was the money that he was refusing to give ukraine for it did not start in 2022 russia was in ukraine during his entire presidency and he did nothing about it except give russia a stronger stance by denying ukraine aid in what world would he have not let russia invade 3 in what context would speaking about jan 6th in any positive way be a good or correct thing in addition he said they were ushered in by the police in what world is a mob crushing a police officer in a doorway being ushered in he repeated many of the lies about jan 6th and the election that he has made many times i e it was democrats took the blame election was fraudulent etc honestly there were so many absolutely blatant lies that there are too many to cover thankfully there are dozen of new organizations to cover them i 've yet to see any of them say he said anything that was 100 % true dude has truly mastered the gish gallop
my point is trump has never had a serious policy he still won in 2016 that ’s not just the maga crowd voting for him stick your head in the sand if you want and as i said we should if he does n’t drop off the ticket but do n’t defend what is going to be a liability with moderates and independents
because trump nominated the supreme court justices that made it illegal biden and any democrat for that matter can not reverse it until there are supreme court positions available letting trump appoint more justices would spell disaster for this country
stock market is highest it 's ever been but prices of foods and goods have skyrocketed yes but that happened everywhere around the world also in my country and all neighbouring countries that 's because of spiking gas prices due to the european merit order system and fear of shortages because of the war in ukraine and leftover effects of the monetary policy during covid this one has literally nothing to do with biden or his administration it does n't matter if housing market is shit all over nothing is being done about it it does matter in the sense that you pointing fingers at biden and saying yeah he 's at fault is just a useless simplification of things but i 'm with you about the point that there is n't much done but this is also a pretty complex topic to discuss job market is shit unemployment rate is rising again in the us again this is a blatant lie here 's the statistic it was mostly at a historic all time low during his presidency comparing last 20 years yes it 's rising slightly in the last few months but that 's also wanted from the fed to bring down inflation even then it 's still lower than most prior years in that statistic minimum wage is still way too low i do n't know how the legal process in the us works regarding minimum wage and who sets them in biden 's speech today he said he will reverse recent actions regarding roe v wade if he has that power why has n't anything been done yet if he makes these claims he must also own his failure to find a solution yeah but your alternative is trump who made the killing of roe v wade possible in the first place and if the gop gets their way next term you 're totally fucked regarding this topic anyway furthermore as with the point above i do n't know the legal details if it 's even possible to do it like you say it
sorry you 're right i misspoke he was convicted of falsifying business records but that is usually a misdemeanor the thing that made it rise to felonies is that he did that in furtherance of another crime that 's why it is n't the same as hilary 's crime
i mean border crossing have somewhere between doubled and quadrupled under biden to act like the situation is the same is absurd can you explain how tax cuts led to inflation
1 at will late term abortions are legal in multiple states and i already addressed the whole post birth thing if you 're just going to repeat what you think is true and not acknowledge reality idk what to say 2 again the russian invasion was in 2022 if you reached to hyper fixate on crimea then you 'll have to take that up with obama because it 's been under russian occupation since 2014 3 you did n't answer my question you just continued to talk about the j6 riot that as far as i know no one said was a great thing you clearly have your views locked in stone it appears you feel very strongly about the orange guy and are unable to have a conversation without getting aggressive
i ’m not “ sticking my head in the sand ” about anything there was a clear difference in the substance of what was said by both candidates biden touted real accomplishments and proposed actual policy trump went on about illigil immagrints and how good his employees tell him he is at golf needing a glass of water and a throat lozenge is n’t a liability and i think actual moderates and independents are smart enough to realize that

look up title 42 border encounters have definitely increased but so have expulsions biden has continued trump 's policy of turning people away at the border inflation is a complicated subject but basically this if you add money purchasing power to an economy that 's already performing near peak you end up with too much money chasing too few goods that leads to price inflation it 's textbook econ 101
1 just because they 're technically allowed does n't mean it 's thing that actually happens on any sort of regular basis to healthly babies ever it 's a literal a literal non issue and talking about as if it is one makes zero sense he did literally mention that democrats are for them that is the lie you can try to counter 2 the lie was that he would have stopped russia invading in what world is that remotely true based in the information 3 the direct quote is on january 6th we were respected all over the world not sure how is out of context it 's part of his response to being asked about jan 6th directly from the transcript again not sure how saying anything positive about jan 6th could ever make sense in any context did you bother to look at any of the fact checking again i 'd love to see anything that he said that made sense and was 100 % factual but i would say trump won the debate sure i do n't like him i 'm not a fan of alleged serial sexual abusers but it 's not because i have n't looked into the stories it 's because of them
why did n’t think they inject every upper they had into him before the debate are they fucking stupid yes yes they are
too bad he already gave the ' rump campaign a treasure trove of video to use unedited in political ads
combine that headline with a handful of quaaludes and you just might get some sleep tonight
look folks let me be clear i am not stepping down we 've got too much work to do too many people counting on us to to make sure we follow through on our promises because at the end of the day it 's about it 's about the future and ensuring that we well you know what i mean
probably the worst timing possible two bad apparences in a row he steps down two good appearences in a row smooth sailing this good luck
trumps advisors ok trump our advice for every question they ask is “ mexicans bad ”
wish they gave him those peds a day earlier
earlier in the day debates sorry west coast the debates do n’t need to be in prime time for you
i ’m kinda wondering if biden might have picked up on obama ’s political rope a dope ’ technique
if i had to guess and this is just theorycrafting here to be clear the biden campaign was worried he might fumble so they probably tried to make him memorize too many lines which just added to the confusion just look at trump 's performance he basically had 2 lines on immigration he kept repeating and that was all throughout the entire debate the rest was his regular stream of consciousness bull
should 've given him whatever he was on for the state of the union lol
you really think that would have been wise when the r 's were already calling for drug tests
when biden said i did n't have sex with a porn star that sunk his re election chances oh and biden owning responsibility for ending abortion is just icing on the cake
“ look folks i ’d rather massage my ego and vanity than step aside even if that means losing ”
and that ’s a fact jack
yup imagine 15 know it alls yelling at you saying “ you can say this but not this ” focus on “ that not that ” “ if he says this word reply with this word ” and they all tell him different things imo they should hire shane gillis to impersonate trump in debate prep and just make up random bs and insults the whole time
yeah my current theory is that his pauses on stage and stumbling where more of him being like “ is this guy ducking serious ” rather than an actual issue
dude biden should n’t even be running anyway if that debate did n’t convince you then nothing will i ’ll be surprised if biden lives another two years and trump should n’t be running either they clearly had him drugged because you can find countless videos of him stumbling over his words in the same way biden was in 2019
ok but that was trump
he was trying to remember the script i hate politics i wish we could just have people being authentic we ca n’t though not because politicians are incapable but because the general population is too stupid to appreciate it
oh just assumed it was biden given how everyone 's talking about how biden blew the debate last night
six of one and a half dozen of the other
oh i knew exactly what you were doing but someone had to bite
i ’ve known about security theater for most of my life but seeing humanitarian theater by my government is a whole new level of disappointing
and if israel was n't being a complete dick about the situation we could just provide that humanitarian aid by land
a giant waste of money because biden refuses to stand up to israel pathetic
earlier this month gop sen roger wicker ranking member of the senate armed services committee was even more blunt “ this needs to end immediately ” he said in a statement and on thursday the pentagon and usaid inspectors general they were launching coordinated reviews of the humanitarian mission and pier in addition senior us republican mike rogers demands biden administration shut gaza aid pier june 27 2024 ps mike rogers is house armed services committee chairman
pete would mop the floor with trump but i guess he had wine in a cave and was under 70 yo so was n’t good enough for boomer democrats lol
what 's ridiculous is this is the headline they used regardless of everything pete said in that interview
i too would have preferred that biden and the democrats not shit the bed this badly but what are you going to do
this sub got toxic as all hell today
the dnc did this to themselves they 've known for 4 years biden has probably early onset dementia from the looks of things they did the same shit with diane feinstein as well to the point feinstein literally was forgetting shit from minutes before and randomly yelling at people biden should 've stepped aside a year ago when his approval ratings were not improving but it 's ego by the dnc and biden why he 's in this position this is something that was always a risk and now in 2024 we run the risk of having a maga white house republican led supreme court which has already been a disaster maga house maga senate they very well could have a super majority everywhere this is a disaster of epic proportions by next week biden needs to announce he 's stepping down the white house cabinet needs to announce biden is no longer fit to be president or the donors need to threaten to pull funding from his campaign if he does n't step down i hate newsome but you put someone like newsome on that debate stage which btw after tonight even if they replace biden trump ai nt debating again so they 've ruined that newsome kills him and likely wins the presidency by a landslide
you never in a million years would hear a republican say a bad word about their candidate even if trump literally shit his pants on national television democrats are such dumbasses
mr trump while you were busy with twitter rants some of us were actually fixing roads bridges and airports if you want to talk infrastructure let 's discuss the specifics like how your administration 's promises did n't quite match up to the potholes left behind pete probably
if any country deserves what ’s coming it ’s you guys
pete would sell out his partner his grandma his dog and the entire population of bumfucksville in to become president so yeah i suppose he ’s the ideal democratic candidate
mayor pete buttigieg is the secretary of transportation for a couple reasons to treat our infrastructure as a mckinsey project to enrich the private sector at our expense and to rack up executive experience so they can force him down our throats as president in the near future politics manufacturing consent at its finest
boomer here would love to see pete as the democratic candidate
i was gutted when he suspended his campaign first time in a while that i was excited about a candidate
pete would be an excellent president
i 've always heard that pete was n't good enough for the young voters like he 's gay but not gay enough corporate gay they think he 's a shill he gets a lot of hate from the bernie bros
gen jones here i 've always thought he should run generalise much
it is not that geriatric gen z here or millennial depending on who you ask it is just not the right time for him to run especially as an openly gay president
mayor mckinsey would also get massacred in a general election
wine in a cave lol
it ’s wild so many people stating their vibes followed by “ it ’s so obvious everybody knows this the solution is clear as day ” despite the fact that everything they say is opposed by all available facts dunning kruger in full effect today need to log off for a week to get my blood pressure down
i do n't think we are allowed to submit substack here but seth abramson does a quality analysis on the 2024 nominee issue here
this is what happens when you try to guess which candidate is the “ most electable ” instead of picking the best candidate democrats stay outsmarting themselves and it should honestly be studied because it ’s fascinating
lots of democrats worthy of that critique but pete was actually rather forcefully and cheerfully supporting biden that the debate was n't great is just the truth but of course msnbc had to pick that one sentence out of 9 minutes
i ’ll always be amused by how trump ’s first attempt at an insult name for pete was “ boot edge edge ” which was literally on his merch after which some trump intern apparently discovered this and he changed it to alfred e neuman and pete shrugged it off with a “ well at least i got him to make some sort of literary reference ” response the guy is seriously unflappable and i would absolutely love to see how much that would piss trump off
did n’t east palestine and the baltimore bridge collapse on pete ’s watch
eery words from dickpump2541 that is all
he 's smarter than any conservative alive mtg that nutcase still us part of our lives
or you could just watch this clip and a lot of other ones and the way he supports biden
why are letting people force things down your throat
gen x reporting i ’d also give my left one to see pete become president he ’s a seriously sharp guy
him newsome literally anyone under 70 would sweep the floor with trump at a debate
he 's establishment dem just as likely to engage in neoliberal corporatism as he is progressive justice which is to say he 's a step in the right direction but not as far as many feel we need to go i think he 'd be a competent leader perhaps could use another cycle of experience but he 's intelligent and means well bernie bros are going to hate on anyone who is right of sanders which i think is a huge flaw in progressive politics we have to accept that politics involves compromise and whatever we ask for we should expect to get a fraction
he 's a bland neo liberal why would you imagine he is going to fire up the 18 39 demo
yea i do think he ’s a corporate dem he gets donations from corporations and endorsed biden over progressives for the sake of careerism i still think he ’s better than biden also the term bernie bros ’ is extremely sexist imagine if the genders were reversed being sexist is n’t cool
and you just dropped a sexist comment while implying bernie supporters are homophobic shocking that they would n’t support mayor pete also did n’t the small town in indiana that he was mayor of run him out of office because he did n’t handle race relations well also not surprising for a neoliberal
if that he worked for mckinsey is his biggest weakness i ’ll take that certainly over the project 25 we ’ll be getting when biden handedly loses
i mean people have been saying biden ai n’t it for a while now it ’s not a new position his last 6 months have been a disaster in office followed by a mediocre 3 year performance before his one outlier the state of the union had people fooled into believing he was going to ramp up but this debate unequivocally shows that the biden you saw that night is the exception to the rule and not the rule itself he is absolutely melting down in front of our very eyes and the people saying to “ calm down ” will be the same people blaming voters when he loses after not listening to said voters for 3 years you ca n’t have it both ways
this reads like dnc cope no one polls better against trump what quality polling exists that proves this
seth is a good dude
i encourage you to read manufacturing consent by noam chomsky it goes into how the establishment and ruling class are able to bypass democracy in favor of shoving a corporate agenda down all of our throats
and it is amazing to see him calmly calling bullshit on fox
the problem of neoliberals is that they accept the right wing view of government they just think they 'd do a better job of running it that 's what makes the bernie bros not like them see the role of government is to safeguard the welfare of the people equally it should be just as much about building infrastructure as it is about stopping corporations from poisoning people for profit but more than that it should provide actual services that are natural monopolies things like water electicity infrastructure healthcare education etc a government should provide equally to all paid for by actually taxing the people who use that infrastucture to make billions there should not be such a thing as a billionaire that 's a failure of the basic protections that we should enjoy because you can not make a billion dollars without trampling all over people and exploiting what should have been free services for your own gain
arguably what we need most is to simply not step to the right and fall off the cliff so whether that ’s a sane small step left or a larger one it ’d be stupid to chase the ideal over a pragmatic option
compromise used to be understood in progressive politics ted kennedy would always say do n't let the perfect be the enemy of the good small steps lead to big changes the world is more polarized now and thus less efficient just compare 20th century politicians vs 21st century politicians and how much they accomplished
this fucking right here purity tests do nt work in the real world
you ’re really generous with the 39 age range the vast majority of democrats are neoliberals once they get past adolescence
what the fuck do the 18 30 yr olds want apparently aoc is an israel shill according to them and pete used to work at mckinsey these edge lords just wanna burn it all down from the safety of mom and dads place while the rest of us suffer
i mean obama was a bland neo liberal
did n't imply they were homophobic thought everyone knew how it went down bernie and buttigieg had a bitter election in 2020 buttigieg said that bernie 's campaign was an inflexible ideological revolution that leaves out most democrats he also compared bernie supporters to trump fans saying they 're two sides of the same coin then he drops out of the race and becomes secretary of transportation basically being seen as a political social climber
no his biggest weakness is that he ’s a nerd with minimal charisma who always talks like he ’s participating in a debate at the oxford union
there have been some polls but it 's rather easy to understand other than bernie who 's even older and less fit and hrc the only one with reasonably high national name recognition is vp harris the only other ones that have at least some name recognition and could theoretically run are gavin newsom and buttigieg newsom does n't poll well in swing states high unfavorability pete is in a much better position there but he certainly could n't run by bypassing the vp
thanks for the recommendation i agree with the sentiment that the common person is getting screwed i encourage you to use a different word choice
this noam chomsky noam had the sense to understand that both parties are not the same we ought to stop rubber stamping the ' worse evil ' or there is no chance for significant progress
there are a myriad of positions between neoliberalism and democratic socialism namely progressivism and moderate liberalism or welfare liberalism i 'm saying buttigieg is somewhere there but i do n't know him well enough to peg it and i 'm also saying that democratic socialists being obsessed with ideological purity will make them politically useless thankfully it 's mostly a problem with voters internet denizens than the politicians themselves who understand that you can not get anything done if you do n't compromise with people with whom you disagree if ds had the majority of support they 'd be perfectly capable of implementing everything they want but we have a plurality of ideologies no one ideology has the power neoliberalism 's power comes from alignment with corporate interests also i did not say anything about bernie bros not liking neoliberals that 's pretty fucking obvious i was saying bernie bros not liking buttigieg despite the fact he 's not a neoliberal he 's more around where joe biden is which would be a moderate liberal which would put him left of neoliberals
interesting that you just gave a summary of pete 's positions regarding the role of government including his critique of democrats accepting republican framing reining in corporations fighting monopolies and taxing the rich what exactly makes him a neoliberal that he 's working to reach those goals by using a diverse toolkit from private persuasion and public pressure to time consuming rule making investigations and law suits rather than angry shouting from a podium
not a neo liberal former mckinsey executive whose policies can best be defined as a corporatist and middle of the road i do n't think someone to the left of biden and pete is advocating for an anarchist
cool strawmen why do n’t you try understanding people with differing viewpoints
it 's interesting how aoc toes the party line now she started out as a loudmouth
biden is polling like shit in swing states and newsome has an actual pulse and is outstanding as a public speaker and debater the idea he 'd do worse against trump is laughable to me
the reason why democratic socialists do n't get the support is because when they run they do not have billionaire donors behind them nina turner had the entire dnc against her in her race and this is a woman literally trying to enact and fight for insanely progressive policy positions for americans but politics is not won on policy any longer it 's ran on money and how you can gain exposure from that money look at what happened to bowman dude went against israel and those groups put up like 50 million against him in attack ads and exposure for his rival just to make sure he got fucked same shit happened to bernie bernie was beating trump in late polling by up to 12 points the dnc through leaked emails coordinated to fuck him over
his wine cave for one a guy who is n’t a neoliberal does n’t host a wine cave in a multimillion dollar mansion for billionaire only donors but i doubt you ’re looking for actual critiques mayor pete also has a terrible track record running a non diverse small town in indiana if he ca n’t handle a few thousand people he ’s not fit to run a country with 325 million it ’s really as simple as that
exactly like the charismatic cool black guy s
biden is polling about even in the swing states there was a poll of the support for alternatives in 7 swing states and newsom was heavily under water 11 % less support than whitmer and 9 % less than buttigieg toss up in nv and negative everywhere else people know and like biden and he never was a great debater newsom is less known he 's from ca and while he 's good in interviews he does risk to be seen as fitting into the stereotype of sleazy politician
this wine cave narrative was complete bs and peak hyporisy it was a normal fundraiser at an event location that happened to be at a winery instead of a fancy hotel the same kind of fundraiser every other candidate was doing including warren and sanders when running for senate it was n't for billionaires either just donors who had maxed out at 2 800 including doctors or school principals he did an outstanding job at turning around the trajectory of a low income industrial city that had been declining for decades and had 12 % unemployment when he took over despite having to deal with lack of funds and a republican state government just a curious why do you think a city of 100 000 25 % black 45 % non white is a non diverse small town
14 000 people total voted in the first election pete buttigieg won and 11 000 total voted in the second he ’s not equipped to deal with the scale of a us election south fucking bend has 56 % white males and 10 % identify as two races including white it ’s not like he ran a city like atlanta or something what is his claim to fame in time as mayor he served in afghanistan during 1 8th of it so he was n’t even really making the decisions for almost 15 % of his term and then you have the whole eric logan debacle in which that 25 % black population you mentioned almost unanimously called him out for being a racist i mean his polling with any demographics outside of caucasians was utterly abysmal so what ’s his defining campaign feature that he ’s gay that is n’t going to be a reason for the layperson to vote for him and will undecidedly turn many voters away then let ’s look at his morals he colluded with biden to drop out before super tuesday while warren colluded to stay in after losing her home state so biden could get the nomination in return for a cabinet position so he has absolutely no morals or ethics just whatever he needs to do to advance his career and that ’s not even going into the wine cave debacle which was absolutely much worse than the media made it out to be pete is a walking gaffe like i honestly fail to see a single redeeming quality he has and he encompasses the smug neoliberalism that got us here in the first place he was never a serious candidate
allentown pa shannon salter checked the results of an online poll that she gave each year to her high school civics students one of the questions asked whether they would support lowering the voting age to 16 “ everyone said no ” salter told her students in late april “ that has never happened before so i am dying to dig into why ” salter a 53 year old white woman stood at the front of the classroom her students black and hispanic teenagers drawn from allentown ’s working class neighborhoods were arrayed around her all were seniors most were weighing whether they will become first time voters in the fall when the presidential election could come down to their state pennsylvania one student complained that social media had polluted his peers ’ minds with misinformation and fried their attention spans “ a 16 year old nowadays that ’s not old enough ” he said “ there ’s no maturity or knowledge there ” another who had spent much of the coronavirus pandemic living with his mother in an abandoned building talked about the social and emotional damage that the restrictions had inflicted “ as kids we ’ve become way more social distanced ” he said some of his classmates were so isolated that they barely spoke to anyone he added surely they were n’t qualified to choose the next president read more here
a civics teacher what school teaches civics way back in the late 70s i had a great high school civics teacher and we never knew his personal political opinions because he could debate both sides of the issues when giving examples
yes democracy can be taught the principles are clear
between active shooter drills watching classmates get killed watching mom and dad with money struggles and now christians have raised almost a billion dollars to demonize lgbtq students in our public schools while at the same time denouncing the teachings of diversity equity inclusion of their savior why does our government allow school shootings what does the new slavery curriculum have to do with project 2025 this is not a mistake and very calculated for a future of dystopia and unlimited profits and power for the evilest people on the planet the kids know the answers they see the truth so why do we keep accepting the waaapublicans wo n't let us excuse
one student complained that social media had polluted his peers ’ minds with misinformation and fried their attention spans “ a 16 year old nowadays that ’s not old enough ” he said “ there ’s no maturity or knowledge there ” the fact that they can understand and admit this shows they 're more mature and knowledgeable than some people 10 20 30 years older than them i 've always been of the mindset that at the very least juniors and seniors should be able to legally vote in local elections such as school board races in order to understand and see how participation in even the smallest of elections effect them
biden needs to be replaced by a viable dem
my parents both taught history for decades which includes civic education they held mock elections debated laws studied the constitution and case law even organized protests my mom retired last year while i do think we need to revitalize and emphasize civic education the broader problem is that our political system no longer represents the people if it ever did and young people are more and more aware of this even from a young age so that by the time they 're 18 they 're already apathetic they see the government failing to protect them by their inaction on gun violence they see the government failing when it comes to the environment inequality healthcare these are all issues that have clear solutions with widespread support yet nothing changes so why should they bother with voting when it does n't seem to matter that 's the prevailing attitude among young people today
this is delicious have a great summer steve
bannon my hordes of warriors will prevent anyone from forcing me into a jail cell lol
so laws do apply to steve bannon i bet he is shocked to find this out
no you ca n't have a second uniform to wear over the first one
bannon imagined wrongly the protection the supreme court is giving trump also applies to him but bannon and all the rest of the maga will find out that in a world of dictators only the dictator is protected and none of his stooges are bannon joins the hordes of useful idiots like those in jail for the january 6th insurrection who trump had promised to pardon who donald trump uses to his own profit and then drops when they stop being useful to the wannabe dictator the gop only protects trump help him at your own perils
i wonder if bannon is going to attempt to dry out this weekend or just power through it in custody next week
bet he ’s suffering major whiplash right now
enjoy the 4th in prison
he s probably shocked that the sc did nt have his back
the guy they have on tape admitting to adding “ as much filth as possible “ to the smear camp involving the precious laptop they care so much about
and so the alcohol withdrawal will begin
put him in a cell with roberto
what can you buy with conspiracy theories in prison
could n’t happen to a more disgusting guy oh wait there ’s a long list of shyte heals i can think of what would be on your list
fuck steve bannon i mean that literally
they should have done it on july 4th
“ and we really mean it this time young man ”
i hope it ’s on tv
ramen sales at the prison commissary gon na boom as stevieb tries to curry favor with his new roomies
trash human who could have used his intellect to better the world
will he get out before the election i hope not i would love to go thru a whole election cycle without having to see or hear anything about him other than stories about him from jail
do n’t drop the soap fuckface
i would have been working on that for a minute just in case but here ’s to hoping he has n’t lmao
you did n’t spell gym jordan right
look at how long it took to hold bannon to account wait that long before you complain about any dems suffering no consequences these processes take time but hunter biden also appeared before congress so there 's that
bannon is no conservative he 's a fascist drop the soap
your info is out of date after resisting over video he did comply and appeared as summoned but the real problem is that right wing media only report the one part and not the other because they do n't want to scare away their bubble world readers
right and when did bannon defy his subpoena was it before december contempt of congress is one of the slowest moving crimes mostly because once you do come in you 're no longer in contempt of congress dissimilar to contempt of court so you get a ton of chances before it becomes criminal bannon could have appeared before congress anytime before his criminal hearing which took from october 2021 to july 2022 the math shows it is months longer than the time since december of last year and that does n't even matter because hunter biden did appear before congress so he is no longer in contempt so there is no longer a crime to charge him with there bannon is the only one getting charged because bannon is the only one who committed crimes members of the house excluded
how does this nobody ’s nothing burger for a 4 month sentence get to the supreme court it ’s a ridiculous abuse that it was able to escalate
i wonder how many trump supporters are even aware of the border wall scam how many believe donald trump built new sections of wall
he 's only doing 4 months he acts like he 's gotten decades
i read the build the wall charges were ny state charges
i hope steve b meets some really nice inmates in prison
could n’t happen to a nicer pos
well at least the supreme court seems to have standards when it comes to this guy what next trump trying to bail him out
no more gin and tonics for you rummy
he ’s going to be a busy man
i wo n't be surprised if he leaves the country
biden had a good chance to bring it up when the border discussion started but we know how that went
it sounds like he ’s an alcoholic so 4 months forced to be clean is a long time he ’s not sure the prison wine can stop the withdrawal
he kinda look like it too
yeah and when he does it ’s probably gon na distract the gop since now one of the former ringleaders is gone
yeah my parents are undecideds still they wo n’t vote for trump but they are n’t sure if they wanna vote for biden and this is the impression i got from them they said biden did terrible last night but they also said trump just lied and rambled basically they ’re exactly where they were before the debate started still no change in opinion whatsoever
this tracks with my friends and family not interested in trump at all but they 're less interested in biden now and just more depressed for the future
once again there should be a neither option among the multiple choice for who won the debate question
all people talked about at work today was how terrible a candidate biden is
things have a strange way of working out the moment people realized how terrible biden was they were stuck with the reality that trump could win after a few days people could come in terms with biden 's handicap just like mega did with trump the fear of losing the election may make more people to come and vote it 's like you support and be more tolerant once you come to know how weak the person is compared to when you thought they are better off so opposite effect of why hillary lost or why brexit won in uk
it ’s time to normalize that a two person debate has never been a binary choice of who wins or who loses a debate because we are the audience so the debate boils down to what we think of it so it ’s always been possible for an outcome of a debate is the audience does n’t feel like either party won a debate be the outcome unsure if both parties swayed anyone based upon their arguments or instill a feeling of confidence in their presentation if the audience is n’t swayed then that debate was all for not biden “ lost ” because at the end of the day the audience lost confidence he could fulfill the job he had proof to back up his claims and record but it would come out as a jumbled mess trump “ lost ” because he did n’t actually provide nothing of value he dodged every question asked of him he fumbled as often as biden did he really only shined to project and lie like he ’s done before at rallies
the country lost the debate i ’m a biden supporter but we need to recognize his performance was not just due to having a cold i think he has been a good president and will be looked upon fondly in time but we ca n’t have a candidate that can not convince undecided and independent voters to trust his judgment after a performance like that trump was terrible and the fact that biden could n’t even point that out and he is all we are talking about is the problem time for self reflection democrats this is a wake up call
biden was never good at debates but we are picking a president we want somebody who can get things done that also have a good sense of what is right and wrong oh right and that is not a crook
us really requires more voting parties like that they can only decide between 2 candidates is sooo bad we in sweden get to decide between like 20ish politic parties and over 32 candidates the more the better
you can not win a debate when you do n’t answer the debate questions and lie every single answer
are you sure he did n’t win trump might of lied through his teeth but it ’s not as though the average american is going to be aware of what was lied about because no one fact checked him
that 's not how competitions work
anyone saying that trump did n’t win is lying to themselves he destroyed biden he even did it while not being too aggressive he actually showed some restraint i ’m shocked he actually could with all the amo biden gave him did he lie repeatedly of course did he have gafes yup was he more charismatic coherent and just generally way more confident in delivering his message you betcha it was an absolute shellacking this is coming from a lifelong liberal that would would n’t vote for trump if you put a gun to my head biden needs to bow out and let someone coherent beat trump before the country is destroyed even worse than it already is oh wait i meant world
accurate it is hard to win when all your lies got shot down by biden after all at least when he was n't tongue tied no policy no questions answered just his pre rehearsed lies like normal like his rallies
i 'll bet to the average american who may or may not vote trump came off extremely well he was quick witted he was sharp he was funny
so much copium trump absolutely won
this sounds like copium my dude lost so i will just say the other guy did n’t win to make myself feel better
unfortunately he 'll win in november based on how things are going
damn hopefully interest rates and home prices do n’t go down
did the usa lose knowing they do not have a reasonable option for president why does the usa need to have such a powerful position in control
probably less turnout than last time i think i ’m going for trump though unfortunately just because i do n’t agree with how the dnc operates
they have a choice between democracy and facism and they are undecided what the hell
trump is an obvious wannabe autocrat last term was chaotic and he had some people in the cabinet that could stand up against him and got fired for that this time around he and his team of handlers is much better prepared it 's sad to see that many voters still do n't understand what is at stake trump is not a normal candidate he will erode the democracy further on the path to autocracy see hungary early stages or russia later stages how it will be in the longer term
vote democrat or never be able to vote again do n’t get me wrong biden is an old fuck but trump is a fking facist the choice is your
this outcome is still very bad the consensus seems to be that biden did not win over any swing voters with his performance but neither did trump here is problem the enthusiasm gap is real and it just got worse it ’s been well reported that swing voters are considering 3rd party or leaving the presidential ballot blank
100 % lichtman is the only person i saw with one and it got 41 %
not his supporters that need to be convinced tho it ’s the undecided and new voters who may have been pretty young during trump part 1 biden is failing to do that
they need to add a red fact check lights to the podiums whenever the candidate states an inaccuracy the light would flash it would be more entertaining and might reduce the lying if instead it was an electric shock device attached to their genitals
absolutely right people bringing up the transcript like it matters the slightest bit i do n’t even know where to begin with them
you can not win a debate when you do n’t answer any questions and you lie in every single response
how bout you actually respond with something to refute what i said instead of downvoting fucking delusional cowards
yup there ’s a reason bidens betting odds went from a 150 to a 300 in 2 hours
he did n’t answer a single question
nope he lied every single time he opened his mouth we have some fools in this country though they eat up his lies
ca n’t win a debate when every answer is a lie and you did n’t actually answer the question
lol but you like fascism
then you ’re the problem enjoy never voting again enjoy christian fascism i hope you ’re not a woman if so you ’re completely screwed research project 2025
if you vote for trump you are a f idiot who hates america
not everyone is paying as close attention to politics these are the people we need to vote and biden is failing at getting them he did his job in 2020 but now the sirens are ringing too much at stake
people think he ’s just a figurehead so it does n’t matter others believe he ’s a dictator and want that this is why they love the poorly educated
if the democrats really believe that ’s the case maybe they should n’t run a guy that could n’t hang in a middle school debate club
i just read something how a group of undecided voters have now decided to vote for biden
and remember biden practiced for a week and wanted to have this debate it was supposed to be the sotu all over so this was biden well prepared and ready not saying it was n’t a fluke but should his supporters take that chance there is absolutely no world in which trump should be ahead in the polls and yet here we are
yes lying in every single answer does n’t matter at all wow god help us
you seem angry just the lies about after birth abortions alone should disqualify trump in the eyes of every rational voter with an iq above 80 black jobs wtf was that again you can not win a debate with lies you can not win a debate when you do n’t answer the debate questions
betting odds in july do n’t mean shit
it legitimately does not matter people are dumbasses we 're easily manipulated and almost act contrary to our stated priorities winning a debate is sounding like you won the debate and trump absolutely dominated it
i get that that 's what people are trying to say but that does n't match reality re read the transcript if you have to he did n't answer clearly every single question but not candidate ever does even biden failed to clearly answer every question given to him here 's the which ones did n't he answer
wrong actually a debate is won when the other party ca n’t find a way to dispute and prove you are wrong it ’s not about who is right or wrong do you know the rules of debate
it ’s not even close attention if you can not deciver someone that litterey tells you every crime he committed i do n’t know what to tell you
this is what people need to hear biden did what we needed him to do in 2020 simply assuming the same circumstances from 2020 are present in 2024 is dangerous
i disagree with the tone but 100 % agree with your statement this is a major issue for democrats
i am not a fan of biden but i know what facism does
this is why people like me are scared this is supposedly biden at his best even if he simply had a bad night and things improve it was such a bad performance that we have to wonder what the hell is going on if you ’re not able to convince people that you ’re the better option when trump is your opponent you ’re in about as bad a spot you can be
you think people did n’t notice he did n’t answer literally any of the questions
no one cares about the transcript
you ’re allowed to not answer the debate question in a debate that s new to me moderator “ humans should not eat animals ” go trump immigration is killing millions of americans
just to make sure because it ’s been a long time since i was on a hs debate team i looked it up one of the key rules of debate facts presented in a debate must be accurate i honestly ca n’t comprehend why i ’m even having to have this conversation with you
you ’re right but that ’s the state of the world we are in i dunno why but that ’s what we are up against
did biden serious question in all of his incoherent ramblings did he even attempt to stay on topic he could n’t string a sentence together let alone articulately state a viewpoint that answered a question the moment of the night was trump saying “ i have no idea what he said and i do n’t think he does either ”
but did biden point out the false lies who is taking part in the debate the fact checkers you no it ’s biden job to do that and he failed
yes he answered every question asked “ moment of the night ” ok trumper trump just yelled mexicans all night he was fucking terrible
he said and then went into a long speech about why biden should be elected to a second term funny how that did n’t come across in the headline
bernie is honest to a fault he does n't spin it or mince words he always says what he thinks and feels in a better alternative universe he would 've been a fantastic president
i can hear this in his voice
lol that ’s putting it nicely
lmao bernie always keeps it real
bernie cooking with this one
sanders wanted to run this year but did n't for biden 's sake
he needs to spend a weekend at bernie 's to hear the hard truth
based on that answer alone he ’s got my vote
when was biden ’s last debate he ’s old but just out of form same thing happened to obama against romney trump has been working on his insult and lies material in front of an audience since he was booted out of office trump said nothing but lies he is just a better showman there is something about getting up and finding your groove and trump has that edge whomever prepped biden did him a disservice by trying to get him to remember stats he needed to focus on big ideas whatever playbook they had for biden went out the window with this format
bernie would have been 10x a president biden was and he would have faced even more internal resistance to change but he would have tried biden barely did that but fuck the gop time for an old school convention
i have to agree with sanders here as i normally do it 's also good to have someone tell it like it is as others in this thread have been saying
next time try “ he needs to step aside ”
not helpful bernie you should know better stop being salty you lost
he should take a page from bernie and just give the same stump speech over and over again for 20 years without actually doing anything about anything he talks about s
it makes you wonder who 's been running our country for the last four years
the commie is doing his best for the socialist
the fact remains that bernie would have obliterated trump in that debate
remember when hillary lost and everyone blamed the bernie bros welcome to trailer for the sequel
i think it 's better this way bernie is a real one sanders might do a lot of thinking about ideas but he acknowledges reality it 's refreshing he bridges the gap between common knowledge and wisdom this statement invites people to think critically and realize that you do n't have to be superman to be president but you can also do better than a convicted con man
it 's a good strategy instead of denying saying yep he did a bad job relaying his record so here 's his record you gain trust this is why bernie 's honesty is effective
that 's not a fault at all that 's one of the best things about him and he 's been one of the most successful and influential senators of the last 50 years i agree he woulda been a good president do n't agree that he is honest to a fault on the contrary i wish more politicians were as honest as him
it should 've been him in 2016
in an alternate universe bernie destroyed trump last night
in my head it ’s the larry david version which is basically the same thing
do you mean the part where bernie think biden should keep running and can win i think he put that nicely as well
time to replace him with someone competent
we should have had him in 2016
he ’s also older than both biden and trump so should n’t run
biden seriously looked like a corpse
how would bernie running make the situation any better he ’s 82 years old which is older than both biden and trump and he ’s also had his fair share of recent health problems i get we all like his politics but the reality is he ’s also too old
i love bernie but i think we should all learn a lesson after last night about nominating geriatrics to the highest office
you ’re really going with “ biden was rusty ” lol democrats deserve to lose in november they are gaslighting themselves which is hilariously sad
i 'm a hardcore bernie supporter and would have preferred him to biden and still think he 'd demolish trump in an election but as far as an actual presidency goes honestly with a few notable exceptions like the handling of gaza i think a bernie presidency would n't really have been that much substantively different in terms of actual results than biden 's assuming the same balance in the congress and senate biden has veered way left as a president from the position he ran on he 's just been stymied at every turn i 'm not really sure bernie would have had much more luck there republicans gon na republican
you think bernie could have gotten more legislation through let us know how i 'm sure manchin and sinema would like to know too also biden passed 2 pieces of legislation that were worth more than the new deal in today 's dollars i doubt bernie could have gotten any infrastructure bill through congress and even the american rescue plan likely would n't have gotten through bernie has good ideas but a terrible history of gaining support in congress for big pieces of legislation
he tried twice and failed both times he would have never beaten trump in a million years
why what was so bad about his debate performance
so you think he should lie about what he saw instead of telling the truth interesting
i think asking everyone to pretend last night did n’t happen is truly not helpful
bernie helped hillary and biden in 2016 and 2020 even after hillary and the dnc essentially stole the nomination from him he is way more helpful and less salty than i would be in his position
if you actually read the full quotes with context you 'd know he was standing up for biden and the headline just took shit out of context
so you 'd prefer he lie i do n't get your point
you “ i ’m going to close my eyes and put my fingers in my ears lalala ca n’t hear you ” totally normal approach that proves biden is a ok
you sound as cultish as the magats do you know
trump definitely took notes trump did jack shit for four years
bernie has done more for down ballot fundraising for state and local progressive candidates than just about any other democrat in the party straight up you do not get an aoc without bernie she attributes her success to organizing by the justice democrats action group who also got a bunch of other progressive youngsters elected you know who started the justice democrats two senior bernie 2016 staffers riding and harnessing the momentum from his campaign after he lost the primary you know who shows up to stump for state and local justice dems as reliably as clockwork bernie he 's the grandfather of the modern progressive movement that 's coalesced since 2016 the entire political landscape of the democratic party not to mention biden 's 2020 policy planks would look radically different if not for bernie hell even outside the justice dems half the progressive caucus are newly electedswho ran for office on the tails of his 2016 campaign because it demonstrated there was an actual fierce hunger for radicalyl progressive policies among voters
i personally love the conspiracy theorists on the right saying this and alluding to obama being the man running the country in the shadows good god that would be amazing to hear obama was a damn decent president far better than trump i honestly wish obama got a third term and he would against trump even a fourth term if he could run again i have no doubt in my mind he would wipe the floor with donnie
i think biden should step aside but this is nothing compared to what was going on during reagan 's second term if biden gets a second term of his own though all bets are off
if you think bernie sanders is a communist all of europe would be considered communist countries
yes and no you would have thought bernie obliterated trump undecideds on the other hand would have come over to trump as a result of this imaginary debate because they would have felt badly for him seeing him get obliterated we 're way out from the election none of this is going to stick but polls are indicating the debate won a bunch of people over to biden for the time being there 's actually a mechanism for this when any of us is doing public speaking the people watching us are literally rooting for us to do well and over empathizing with us when we stumble because they 've been there it 's sort of like the trick to asking someone who dislikes you mildly to do you a favor if they say yes they start to like you a ton more brains are so freaking cool this is the line biden was trying to walk and we see it so often in an over coached politician hilary for instance is so much more likable without her advisors i have some favorite marketing stories about how people lie and bad marketers believe them but it 's late so in a nutshell people lie especially in group settings like focus groups and bad marketers believe them and then make decisions based on those lies and you get hilary trying to be likable instead of being the smartest person in the room like she is and the in authenticity makes it harder for voters to connect with her
moderates in 2016 “ but we refuse to compromise no matter what we will never vote for a socialist ” these assholes fucked up both times for america then threatened progressives to stand in line
nah bernie is wrapping up his 2nd term and one of his progressive padawans destroyed trump last night
wow a week old profile who only posts in anti biden subs and stays primarily in this sub so how much do they pay you by the hour or by the comment for these astroturphing gigs
not a chance for many reasons unfortunately got ta fight for joe
true story i 'd never been to the r democrats subreddit before today and thought i 'd go see what they had to say i got permabanned for what i thought was an extremely reasonable comment i even said i 'd still be voting for biden if he remained the party 's candidate simply because i know how bad things will be if trump gets in again but i suggested that choosing a new candidate might actually energize the electorate since everyone on both sides is so pissed off at the state of the world no explanation given just a permanent ban from the subreddit no joke i lasted longer in r conservative before they banned me we 're sleepwalking into another four years of trump hell if the party faithful democrats do n't get their shit together
buttigieg needs a bit more time to marinate in federal positions but the dude is just so sharp articulate and skilled at cutting through bullshit that i can totally see him being someone who ’s a major positive for the party moving forward not this election most certainly he ’s only been transportation secretary for 3 5 years and his major flaw was inexperience but goddamn it ’s night and day listening to him speak compared to biden trump most other “ heavyweights ” in national politics i was n’t his biggest fan when he ran for president but listening to him nowadays you can see his growth as he ’s stepped into a larger role in government it ’s quite refreshing to see someone with actual energy and who clearly knows how to bunker down and hit the books to improve when necessary
who hillary gavin is the only hope and he is too scared of trump the only democrat with the courage to face trump is biden sad
it 's not about the age it 's about cognitive faculties
plus bernie lost to biden in the 2020 primary
he can finish a sentence without freezing and mumbling or talking about toilets
what did you think about the speech biden gave at his nc rally today
read the transcripts of his answers out loud to yourself report back i ’m a diehard dem but some of you are so rooted in your tribalism that you ca n’t see the political reality until it smacks you in the face come november
did biden have a bad night yes is biden an amazing public speaker no does supporting a media narrative that biden should drop out because of last night makes sense to me no i do n't see supporting a media narrative beneficial to the reelection of biden i am not republican or democratic so not sure which cult i am then lol
that 's not true in the slightest i do n't care how intense your hatred of trump is saying that he did n't do anything is utterly fucking absurd and if you want to get into a debate about it i hope you bring ammunition
so he helped elect a progressive in one of the most progressive districts in the country that ’s your defense lol if it was n’t for the democratic party infrastructure bs would n’t have access to any of those donors try comparing him to jon ossoff or john kelly you know the actual democrats hell he did n’t even out raise elizabeth warren in 2020
just throw him in jail to rot
the dems will one day wisen up to the fact that moderates benefit when the vote is close and so they help keep the vote close by forcing middling candidates to the fore the moderates have destroyed the party it 's why progressives have been looking for a convenient exit for the past decade
oh right 2016 was eight years ago
if trump would n’t already sit in jail that is
“ everyone who disagrees with me is a bot ” i ’m allowed an opinion and i can post it wherever the fuck i want
nope replace him we will lose otherwise
no way i 'm clicking on that because then reddit will be like because you showed interest in a similar community
he 's firmly a neo liberal right of center democrat when he ran in the primaries he can out against multiple progressive policies
when it looked for a few weeks like he might pull off a win in 2020 the number of ridiculous accusations that rained down on him was unbelievable it reached its zenith when a nyt reporter that pete was responsible for a 15 year price fixing scheme that started when he was in high school and also for the war in iraq it was disturbing because it 's the only time i 've ever seen respectable people on the left implement bannon 's strategy of flooding the zone with shit
bernie is even older than biden biden was born in 1942 bernie was born in 1941 when those two were born and they are still alive there were people who had met queen victoria during their lives
it still pisses me off that we could have had bernie and we got biden jon stewart would be a great choice right now
gavin whitmer pete biden does n’t give off “ brave ” or “ courageous ” vibes at all
he ’d laugh in your face for even suggesting it jon ’s whole ethos modus operandi is that he ’s not a politician or actual authority it ’s one of the many reasons he ’s so fucking awesome he ’s just earnest and incredibly self aware he ’d be the first to tell you he has absolutely none of the skills needed to be an effective politician he ’s the exasperated and worried dad who can point out the absurdity of it all but that ’s not at all what you need to be president the whole reason he ’s so influential is because he serves as a foil to the people who are actually supposed to be leading us it would n’t work if he was one of them that being said dude knows how to give a speech like a motherfucker i highly recommend everyone go watch him lambasting congress for stringing along 9 11 first responders every time i see his name come up he ’s a fuckin legend
i think that would be an excellent idea one good thing about nominating a non politician is that he does n’t have a voting record for a fractured left to fight over
it ’s not just cognitive function it ’s overall health which declines as we age bernie had a heart attack four years ago what if he has another one while in office at a critical moment if last night proved anything it ’s that we should n’t want 80 something year olds to run for president
that was a very different biden and you know that
it was still a 50 50 race when covid came in and shut down the campaigns and practically anointed biden
he also had a heart attack 4 years ago and has admitted to having gout high cholesterol and issues with his colon his health and age would be just as much of a liability as biden ’s or trumps because of his age and anyone saying otherwise is delusional
we never been bernie debate at 82 or against trump biden looked fine prior to and now after the debate he was completely out of it in the debate setting
whether you like it or not he is the democratic nominee and you have no choice but to vote for him in november people need to stop bad mouthing him its helping elect trump
i generally do not engage in political discussions on reddit but today i 've seen more democrats with their head in the sand than ever before people saying trump lied all night does n't matter saying biden actually answered the questions does n't matter etc some of the people on here are acting just like trump supporters they try to gaslight people into not believing what they saw last night
the hypocrisy here is nauseating and embarrassing
he helped catalyze the entire coalescence of the progressive wing of the democratic party that has taken place since 2016 and do n't trivialize aoc beating a two decade incumbent with the full support of the party and all its corporate fundraising apparati on grassroots funding and no political background that ai n't nothin to sniff at she ran a historic campaign
biden is n't the convicted felon that 's the other guy
they do n't have to look moderates will take right wing money to destroy the scourge that is progressives
and yet you only have one opinion and post it only in one place curious
no we wo n’t we ’re four months away that ’s a lot of time trump is about to be sentenced and no one is going to care that much about a couple lost trains of thought and some stumbling of words
you can turn that function off
so was biden for the longest time and somehow he ’s been the champion of many progressive policies during his administration like i said i definitely think buttigieg needs more time in government before he ’s ready but let ’s not act like people ca n’t have their views evolve over time we ’d of course need to hear him explain his stances to determine that regardless of whether or not he runs for president though my point was mainly that he ’s most likely going to be an incredibly valuable asset for the democratic party in the coming years this is coming from someone who voted for bernie in the primaries twice so i ’m not just some centrist boob btw
buttigieg is left of center of the entire democratic party biden was squarely in the center of the democratic party which made him more liberal than 75 % of all elected people in congress that is evident by biden 's voting record and pete 's public statements compared to the rest of the dems
i still do n't get why the wine cave was such a big deal
there were people alive in 1941 who used to be slaves
when those two were born and they are still alive there were people who had met queen victoria during their lives when tony hawk was born there were people who had met queen victoria
one still has his cognitive faculties intact it 's not about the age it 's about whose intelligence is n't on a steep decline
bernie has a way sharper mind comparable to any democrat way younger than him and he 's a real populist not a fake one like trump
the next president will likely be a millennial gen x will get screw'd again
jon stewart has never wanted to run for political office ya’ll got ta stop with these fantasies
i am not defending biden he should step aside gavin wo n't run because he is afraid of trump pete could n't beat a lot of other democrats and what has he done with transportation what has he done to impress anyone over the last 3 years his stock has gone down not up whitmer i wish i knew more and that is why she ca n't win either there are far more people who have no idea who she is than recognize the name that is why clinton would be a better candidate who again has no chance
at the moment we need to put up someone americans actually want over someone no americans wants and is voting for just to keep a dictator out
not as bad as project 2025 is about to fuck us all
bernie fucked over bernie america was never going to elect a socialist and he leaned into that label so hard he sealed his own fate
conspiracy bullshit really is n't helpful right now
well bernie failed in 2016 failed in 2020 bernie is 82 now
anointed biden what are you going on about it completely stymied all democratic get out the vote efforts which were almost entirely based on small person to person group to group ground game and local efforts always has been that way the gop has always had a direct mail and ad get out the vote efforts because they routinely have far more money and dark money to fund those types of efforts covid was far more a negative for the biden campaign than the trump campaign trump 's fumbling of the response was what doomed trump but it absolutely in now way anointed biden in way at all at least get your basic facts straight
you just described the health of half of americans
“ do n’t tell the truth ” is an interesting approach to take but not the one i ’m going to choose what ’s helping elect trump more than anything is the fact that we have a candidate who is seemingly incapable of exploiting his weaknesses also he ’s actually not the democratic nominee he ’s the presumptive nominee if we are serious about winning we have to start calling on him to step aside
wow classic dysfunctional family dynamics dad 's drinking problem is never the issue it 's the people being honest about it who are the ones causing trouble
i 'd argue that trump 's lies do matter but the fact that 's he 's a lying sack of shit does nothing to improve biden 's debate performance if anything the awfulness of trump should be an argument for putting up a really strong candidate instead of someone we have to make excuses for the really you 're voting for the administration not the president arguments make me cringe
lost so much respect for the left today are we christofacists no but we got some serious shit to work out
to be fair i 'm of the right i was just cracking a joke about how insane people are in this thread i would n't take my comments to heart i 'm only here to stir the pot and laugh at this
how so how does bernie throwing shade at biden help the deomocrats please explain without using crayons
taking the moral high ground against a traitor and felon running for president is n't helpful we need to win and guarantee he ca n't stop being a naive idealistic child
if trump gets elected biden is going to fucking jail
right biden 's age wo n't play a role in people 's minds and honestly he 's just getting younger at this point anyway
replace him or we lose
kinda why people want him to run tbh if you want that much power you have to be a little sociopathic lol
we all said we ’d vote for a dixie cup full of shit before trump all of those are better than the dixie cup
we should all vote to keep the dictator out
if americans actually wanted bernie he would have won he did n't
this is true and untrue his policies are n't even that left leaning he definitely leaned way too hard on that unamerican label to his own detriment
it was never a conspiracy it was plain as day in 2016
thank you i feel like the cognitive dissonance in this thread is wild i also agree with bernie politically but people are taking it so personally to say he should n’t run due to his age by all means suggest a younger candidate but to suggest an 82 year old who will be 83 by november i do n’t know how you complain about biden and trump ’s ages and then say bernie should run in the same sentence insanity
covid benefitted biden much more than other campaigns because it allowed biden to hide the lack of enthusiastic crowds he would have received in a more conventional campaign knowing what we know now about outdoors gatherings there was no science behind barring outdoors gatherings during covd fortunately vladimir putin ended covid because when the russia ukraine war started covid was gone from the news
but are half of those americans also 82
i can see your maga hat
i agree 100 % when i said does n't matter i just meant for those who still deciding or open to change in their vote i do n't think a lot of those people exist even if they 're just 5 % of the vote that 's millions of people more concentrated in swing states and i think they are going to decide the election i ca n't get inside the minds of people in that camp but if i had to speculate mental acuity was an important issue to them i think a lot of people came out of last debate thinking that trump is a jerk and liar like you said it 's just that biden had to show he still had it and he failed
it 's not really the left it 's establishment democrats as someone on the left i 'll still vote for biden if he 's the nominee but this is shaping up to be another i told you so moment for the democratic establishment they 've already written off a lot of youth vote now they 're telling us we should n't believe our own eyes and ears i have no idea what they 're thinking but they are n't thinking long term at all
no your comment was fine the hypocrisy is yelling “ lie lie lie ” at republicans and then thinking it ’s okay and even encourage lies if it helps democrats crazy
it does n’t obviously that does n’t mean he should lie about it if you think politicians lying to the people is good then i do n’t know what to tell you that ’s a nice facist trait you support though
you ’re calling everyone naive but looks to me like you ’re projecting
keep him and we win
it 's in the main settings i forget probably under feed
okay but if he keeps saying he does n’t want to run why focus on him it ’s a waste of everyone ’s time focus on actual potential candidates like whitmer
better than a cup of sh t 2024
it was deeply rigged my man dncs are filled with elite rich people trying not to pay taxes
after all the dust settled the only substantial thing that occurred was that donna brazile warned hillary clinton 's campaign that she would be asked about lead poisoning at a debate being held in flint if you think that changed the outcome of the election we 're not going to agree
reddit i do n't want that old white dude i want this old white dude the rest of america um i 'm kind of over all the old white dudes actually in another thread they 're saying biden 's posture being hunched is indicative of dementia it is not and then you see a photo like this one and well i guess the nicest thing i can say is this is why we do n't armchair diagnose people based on what we read on the internet for the record i really like bernie he would not have won a national contest in 2016 or in 2020 and i 'm damn sure he knows that but i like him and i 'm glad we get to have him in the senate that said i was surprised he decided to run again when it 's probably time he enjoy his retirement and mentor new politicians because i think he could do an exponential amount of good that way
going a bit too mask off there lmao
no but the subject was looking for a non geriatric e g under 82 replacement
sorry if i ’m being argumentative but this has bugged me as i engaged today this idea of “ left ” being somehow inherently different than “ democrats ” sure ideology is a spectrum but democrats definitely champion more left leaning policies not to sound like an old man but back in my day left meant people left of center now we have leftists liberals etc idk what my point is here but we really have separated ourselves into tribes have n’t we
well i 'm sorry you 're just finding this out the left likes to run by the marxist playbook and a big part of that is intentionally lying to get votes why do you think so many politicians on the left scream about how 50 % of the country is kkk nazi members who are currently organizing an army to start civil war and kill trans people or something marxism says if you say this about your enemy enough eventually it will become true was n't really that long ago that the prevailing political narrative was just like right left we 're different but we try to get along lets shake hands that quickly transitioned to the other side literally wants us dead
no i 'm telling you what you do n't want to hear and you are deflecting
she 's lucky she deleted all those emails and she deleted all those whistle blowers
i 'll have to check it out thanks
yeah it was rigged by his voters not showing up
for fucks sake no it was n't
if you think not including the super delegate counts in the results before the first ballot was cast we ’re not going to agree but hillary lost to trump anyway so we definitely learned she was a shit candidate with no ifs ands or buts maybe the worst nominee to ever run in this country ’s history glad the democratic party forced that down all our throats
okay even so half of americans have not had a heart attack less than 1 million have a heart attack every year so i seriously doubt half of americans under the age of 82 have high cholesterol gout and have had a heart attack in the last 5 years unless you have a stat showing this and again the fact is the older you get the more serious these conditions are
on an american scale alone you might be right but it 's very silly to frame things like that hypothetically we have 2 candidates one wants to exterminate minorities and one wants to enslave the minorities is the enslaver suddenly ' left ' to you just because the other guy is further right obviously that s an extremely hyperbolic example i pray we never have to actually think about that outside of a hypothetical but the point is narrowing your window then just comparing 2 options gets you weird and inaccurate in the bigger picture labels most republicans vary between being right and very far right in a more objective sense internationally in most other countries someone like aoc and bernie would n't even be in the same party as joe manchin kristen sinema or many of the other more centrist moderate dems ex dems now in quite a few countries someone like manchin or sinema would be in the right wing party biden in a different centrist party and aoc or bernie in a more left party but here in the us the democrats are just a giant tent party caucus
i understand what you 're saying and i agree that it gets annoying and self destructive when we splinter ourselves into a bunch of smaller groups and reduce our overall power but i was banned from r democrats today for merely sharing my opinion about the debate in this case it 's definitely democrats rather than the left who are downplaying biden 's debate performance and i think it 's valid to make the distinction here i 'd never visited that sub and i really was n't expecting it to be some sort of purity test so that was disappointing to say the least democrats are n't doing themselves any favors if they choose to ignore reality the way conservatives do
i ’ll tell you what you do n’t want to hear biden was not terribly articulate to say the least
no problem i ca n't find it now but i swear it 's in there
dws literally argued in court that they were allowed to rig the primary and the courts agreed that ’s why she was forced to resign i guess people just pretend democrats do n’t rig elections because that would make them look like a cult
if you think not including the super delegate counts in the results before the first ballot was cast well put
interesting how casual comments get such heated responses
we get it you just got into college and you think you understand the world the world is n't black and white lying about this particular issue is not totalitarian relax bro it 'll be alright if bernie does n't throw a little shade at biden it wo n't cause ww3 holy cow you dramatic children are hilarious
i would argue your comment was casual but also exaggerated
trump ’s chief of staff was the one who confirmed this
man bashing the fallen heroes of our military is not a good look trumpy boy
listen really carefully at 5 17 31 i think trump actually shits himself edit it 's between when trump says it 's too much money and it 's tremendous
i thought the line where he said my son ’s not a a sucker you ’re a sucker landed well
oddly calling guys who signed up for the military saps losers was part of michael coleone 's journey in the godfather a mafia movie strange parallel
should have called him a convicted felon
well that 's tremendously useful to our nation 's precarious situation
come on joe do you honestly think you deserve another chance dnc puppet masters failed you and us please exit gracefully
can i get a timestamp watched most of it but i could n't bare to watch more when it started becoming a tangent of unrelated bs
its hearsay and the swing voters we have to woo to win do n't exclusively sources news narrative from democratic lean preferred media outlets what is not a ' good look ' is biden spending more time ' base watering ' ie repeating talking points that are big hits with the base but undecided do n't care about instead of focusing on selling himself and delivering a clear strong message to the undecided this cnn format tamed trump by not giving him an audience he could rely on to have his back and cutting off his mic so could n't interrupt biden just flubbed
i thought he may have turned red but you ca n't tell if you start as orange
oof 2 year account and only comments on politics in the last day found the plant
you can find it yourself
what is not a ' good look ' is biden spending more time ' base watering ' ie repeating talking points that are big hits with the base but undecided do n't care about instead of focusing on selling himself and delivering a clear strong message to the undecided you talked to all of them already you 're faster than santa delivering presents to every house in a matter of hours
he ’s said things just like that a million times before and a general confirmed it it happened and it ’s not surprising at all
his chief of staff confirmed he said it directly also look around we are n't in a court good luck pretending this did n't happen
yep he said something like the only criminal here is the one i 'm staring at and trump was just like
ah there it is okay will do
everything i 've read up on it is hearsay but it is fucked that there 's a rumor like that and if it is true then that would probably be an eye opener for alot of his supporters people that were around em for that trip say they did n't hear him use those words while others say he did
as an active member of my state 's democratic party i have talked to those coordinating our state survey which will be sent to the dnc on tuesday and what type of responses they are getting so far of course states vary but undecided voters in my state are crucial to expanding the party 's power
no trump has n't said things like that million times kelly confirmed his being one of the atlantic 's anonymous sources for a political gossip hit piece in sept 2020 meanwhile bolton and pompeo who do n't like trump and would politically benefit in their factional space to confirm kelly 's gossip denied kelly 's claims and continue to stand behind trump on the matter to this day
and yet he waited until sept 2020 to tell this alleged tale and as an anonymous leaker ahead of the election of a man who fired him in 2018 meanwhile john bolton mike pompeo and former wh aide zach fuentes backed trump i am sorry but as a moderate that just does n't pass as having happened especially since i keep tabs on ' all sides ' like so many other moderates but i totally understand the yummy scrumptious confirmation bias within the safety confines of the base like at his nc rally what is not appropriate is biden using the talking point as if its confirmed fact and during a debate that really should have been about outreach appeal to the undecided voters vs ' base watering ' because the base is already committed to joe or potential replacement
it 's confirmed to be true no one cares what you think you know it 's been reported on before a general and trump 's own chief of staff independently confirmed it
and yet here you are vehemently defending donald trump comment after comment
if you have n’t noticed then you ’re not paying attention these comments are all over the place even if you only count the things he ’s said about john mccain it ’s disgraceful
imagine believing donald trump over john kelly donald trump claimed last night that people are performing “ after birth abortions ” and told literally a lie a minute
“ as a moderate that just does n’t pass a having happened ” lolol wow this is a whole new level or righteous centrism keep carrying water for fascists
so john kelly independently confirmed it when exactly better yet do n't facts will remain facts no let people decide
dude bolton and pompeo do n't like trump if the comment happened as kelly claims it would benefit bolton and pompeo to back kelly but they do n't instead the back trump on this story simple logic when looking at gossip
lol bro you want facts check out the true to false ratio between biden and trumps statements people do n’t decide facts you should at least be intuitive enough to question why
“ we do n’t want it to come out in some book or some memoir in a couple of years or a decade we ’d need to know now ” says the man who sat on trump ’s mishandling of covid until after the election because of course book sales were more important than letting the public know how trump purposely mishandled the pandemic
bob woodward made a major contribution to our understanding of the world that was 50 years ago
possible explanations for the debacle the president actually did have a rhinovirus and took some sort of cold medication to help the symptoms irony get it which had the not entirely unexpected side effect of sending him off to drowsy time an older gentleman to be sure the president was up waaaay past his bedtime the debate started at 9pm had had a late perhaps too heavy supper before the debate and was forced to stand there at attention for an hour and a half instead relaxing into his cozy chair with a postprandial glass of scotch and a good cigar the president actually is getting progressively more unfocused and forgetful and did n't have his aides close at hand to cover for him this time the president is playing the politically shrewdist long game on record to lure his opponent into a devastating complacency for the next bout in september if they both make it that long
ok i totally get it but someone else might not know what 's the irony here you guys should explain it i have to go look at something else right now
exactly he ’s been on that pedestal ever since and been considered a paragon of neutral journalism when he ’s clearly not for far too long
your fourth point reminds me of this phil hartman snl sketch where he played mastermind reagan
i wish it was the latter but we all know it is n’t true he bombed but i guess people will vote for a guy that “ won ” the debate by lying constantly for 90 minutes and a lousy track record as president over a guy that fumbled some of his answers but has told the truth and has been a pretty good president all things considered
occam razor would say 1 and 2 anything else would have you assume that aids or people close to biden are propping him up in the background have n't we all have nights like biden albeit we do n't look as old since biden is 81
one might say woodward is getting senile
at least he ’ll be forced to shower
funny how quickly the supreme court ruled on this nonsense when they ’ve refused for years to even look at my case concerning my first amendment right to use my penis as a campaign sign
in another year or two he may finally be imprisoned us justice at snail pace
them 's your aggrieved he man posse bro get in the cage wiffum see what you can rally
how will he survive the withdrawals
he looks like he smells like gorgonzola cheese and vinegar
what for two weeks lol
no hell no we just voted in majority to va house and senate trump will not win virginia any other opinion is someone not looking at reality
virginia has 13 ec votes still too early check back in late sept to see if there is any simmer
nah play boy nova hates trump
no it ’s not astro turf by the 1 % and their media drones
it 's not but it makes for great headlines next week fl and tx will be back in play the election will come down to the same 5 states as 2020
i ’m out in the country of va where it seemed to be a lot of trump voters but recently a lot of the people ’s stance on him has changed and are switching to either independent or biden which was surprising to see where i live
i hope you ’re right there ’s a lot of maga in va though we really need a huge turnout for the elections
thier jobs are on the line with this one
nova has a lot of trump supporters too prince william country and loudon it all depends on voter enthusiasm that ’s how we got youngkin people stayed home
nah the influx of hispanics in all these states is rapidly changing the electoral map and unfortunately its making many safe blue places start to lean towards republican
huh this makes no sense 71 % of hispanics identify as democrats
influx of illegals are they allowed to vote now
no the second and third generation hispanic voters that are coming of age to vote or becoming more active voters
yes everyone who immigrates to the united states from a hispanic country does so illegally how dumb can you get
biden just said i know i 'm not a young man to state the obvious he says i do n't walk as easy as i used to i do n't speak as easy as i used to i do n't debate as well as i used to but i know what i do know i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong i know how to do this job he says i know what millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up i would not be running again if i did not believe with all my heart and soul i can do this job he adds i mean when biden slurs stammers and get 's words mixed up he corrects himself or at least tries where it appears it my opinion he does in fact know what he is trying to say when trump confuses nancy pelosi with nikki haley three times in the same sentence and then clarifies by saying nikki hayley again that 's something different if only biden did n't have that old man demeanour
at this point there 's probably not much else that can be done but i ca n't help but get a sinking feeling back in ' 16 i remember someone saying that the democrats had chosen possibly the only candidate who could lose to donald trump the gop had spent over two decades working on getting people to hate her and it worked now i wonder if we have n't again picked about the only candidate who could lose to donald trump i 'm older myself and can see how a guy over estimates his capacities and still feels like he did when he was younger but then sometimes it 's just not there objectively and you have to know when to step aside i think we 're at a the candidate has no clothes stage sadly
of course they will stand behind him but biden does n't inspire the ' on the fence ' voters that is most troubling
even if you want to make excuses for his performance last night what happens if when he does just as bad in the next debate and that is in september when it will be too late to switch candidates set aside what you think personally about his abilities and just ask yourself if he inspires enough confidence for undecided voters it 's not even about whether or not he can be president it 's about whether or not he can win
yes i would vote for a moldy piece of bread over trump i would vote for biden ’s dead body if they let me of course i ’m a disabled veteran that depends on the government to live so i ’m just advocating for my own life here but i do n’t think i would survive a trump revenge tour
it 's too risky for any dem to openly disavow him since total unity is needed around any candidate to beat trump the party has to speak publicly with a united message every step of the way anybody who breaks ranks would immediately be asked about who they 're picking instead of biden and then you 're causing a major fracture at least in the article dems did acknowledge the real concerns from the debate jeffries even seemed to put it on biden to prove himself again house democratic leader hakeem jeffries answered with a flat “ no ” when asked friday if biden should step aside but the new york lawmaker added that he ’s eager to see how biden would address his performance at his friday rally “ i ’m looking forward to hearing from president biden ” he said “ and until he articulates a way forward in terms of his vision for america at this moment i ’m going to reserve comment about anything relative to where we are at this moment other than to say i stand behind the ticket ” that 's basically what you can hope for at this point dems ca n't publicly break from biden but they can suggest they 're watching the president closely and expect better that 's a subtle enough way to say there 's some concern
why i love casually they are throwing freedom away
if we want to say it about one party then we need to say it about the other this is about country first not the ambitions or desires of one man joe has a great heart and has done great things for the country but the tools are simply not there it is time to put somebody forward that can do the job
fucking why i am liberal left leaning but at this point i do n't even want to call myself a democrat i feel fucking betrayed and angry how has the people surrounding him not seen or done anything about this trump said that the killing of rvw was a good thing did n't blink when joe said that he would be trying to place an all out abortion ban nodded and smiled when called a rapist and biden could n't capitalize on any of it if he 's this bad now how bad is he going to be in 5 years i will never vote for donald trump but i can see why there are a lot of people that wo n't make the time of day to show up for biden at the polls why ca n't my girl big gretch have a chance i feel like she has done well for michigan she 's smart quick witted and from an important swing state
awesome i ’ve seen this before though with rgb and that turned out fantastic s
ruth bader biden his hubris is going to destroy the county he still has time to get out and endorse someone younger and more vibrant
there you have it folks the precise moment the election was lost this right here
its pretty clear these people do n't give a damn about the country and are so self serving and tone deaf that they 'll ride this horse into the abyss you can not allow people like this to hold power we need a complete overhaul of the democratic party establishment people who can actually read the room and would rather do the hard thing for the benefit of the people instead of the easy thing that maintains the status quo
here 's my big issue we are on a knife 's edge of a possible christo fascist take over of the entire executive branch of the federal government with project 2025 trump can not be trusted to do the job when he is a current felon has more pending chargers that are much more serious and owes hundreds of millions of dollars biden did n't even need to be good all he had to do was not look like woke up from a coma an hour before the debate all he had to do was talk in complete sentences even if the needle did n't move for him just at least be competent yet what happened was exactly that he looked rough sounded rougher could n't complete a coherent thought several times let trump lie over and over and rarely hit back at him trump was by no means the winner of that debate lying and avoid questions left and right but he at least sounded better than biden which to what ever swing voters are left might just be enough to put trump over the edge we 'll fucking see what happens we are still 4 months from the election trump still needs to be sentenced for his 1st trial we might get lucky and get another trial in before november biden may pull it together if there is a second debate an october surprise is always possible but god damn do n't ever let him do that again
so it ’s actually over done deal goddamn
of course they are gross get us a new candidate i ride with the man but within 1 5seconds we knew we were fucked this is not the winning goose
my 2 cents the optics of this debate are terrible however there 's over 4 months left to go and people 's vague impressions of politicians can easily change in that time biden did respond to questions during the debate making points that seemed solid to me see the transcript as biden showed soon afterwards he can still speak coherently one could argue this is due to having a teleprompter now but it does disprove claims he ca n't speak coherently now
i teach 9 12th grade in nyc suburbs and the amount of white teen boys that love trump is concerning no shot that biden wins this replace him
it ’s a gamble they must have real confidence in the swing state independent voters
biden held a fundraiser after last night and sounded energized and great i think it was just the nerves of the moment hopefully he can rally for this second debate and apologize for being sick during the first one or something idk
he 's still a better choice i 'm not sure how anyone could be undecided on who too choose i mean i get that they are but man but look at at all the shit the other guy did and even with biden showing his age he 's still better
then they ’re fucking morons but if there is a chance for a change on the ticket it will only come after the backroom stuff has a chance to build momentum
msm and r politics need to stop panicking over a mediocre debate
you got this joe do n’t let the haters bring you down
more democrats move into the ' death march til we lose ' camp
he 's using the entire country as collateral to bet on himself
yep just hand it to trump on a platter they still got to debate in september where i fear for a repeat congrats democrats your pulling a 2016 all over again
“ i ’ll vote for a 5 day old ham sandwich before i ’d vote for trump ” but yeah that was scary
it 's time we unite around our candidate as much as trump 's cult of personality and those right wingers do for trump this is no time for ageism a form of bigotry that has no place in today 's society and is something trump would preach
is someone pretending that trump had a good debate the entire thing was depressing
the only thing that matters is to vote for nottrump
joe looks good here that was a set up last night a maggot has bought cnn the whole thing was an exercise in smear and disingenuous trump looked like kim kardashian and they washed out joe like how much can you turn up saturation on trump motherfucker looked like a florida orange with blight god damn the republican party and may those who they have deceived learn the error of their ways come back brothers and sisters you are praising a dangerous maniac
unless he is in front of a teleprompter he completely melts down
“ poor ” putting a mannequin up there would have been better absolute dumpster fire
one must imagine t h e a v e r a g e a m e r i c a n sisyphus happy is joever for america
that 's all the same things i said before last night but now that does n't matter i work with a lot of justifiably trump hating 20 somethings and all they could talk about this morning was how bad biden looked
the biggest problem i have with this whole debacle is that it demonstrates that either biden has no one telling him the unvarnished truth or he simply does n’t listen to them the biden team challenged trump to this debate set the rules and timing and still went in and disastrously reinforced his biggest most glaring weakness age his campaign stepped on a rake and it makes me question his strategic decision making and whether or not he can set his ego aside for the sake of the country at the end of the i will vote for biden but if trump puts us on a path to hungarian style authoritarianism i will feel compelled to lay the blame on biden ’s ego
did you watch the whole debate there were several times where he absolutely did not know what he was trying to say he was struggling to maintain his train of thought for 1 2 minutes to answer a question not every time but way too many times
yeah i 'm sure biden can do the job does n't matter he ca n't win the election he needs to go
this is why i 'm still fully in support of biden and ready to vote for him despite being furious with the dnc for putting us in this position trump did not address any concerns over his policies or criticize and refute any of biden 's policies he just lied i 'm not even a political expert and i knew enough stats and economics to outright refute the literal majority of trump 's talking points so trump did nothing to address anything lied continuously and only cemented in my mind what a shit and devastatingly damaging president he 'd be while biden came across as way too old for this job and clearly a cabinet policy vote over a vote for him given those clear results i 'm still going for biden but fuck the ghouls in the dnc creating this shit situation it honestly feels like an escalation from how bad their corruption came out during the bernie clinton primaries
perpetually looks like he is sending back soup at a deli
i will try to start posting this from his rally in nc he sounded terrible in the debate bumbling and his voice is too soft sounds pretty good here biden did nt go out on the debate stage and commit any crimes he did nt rape anyone i 'm not backing down and it does nt change my mind the felon on the left lied constantly and the old guy on the right looked old
there 's a whole lot more that can be done beyond accepting defeat that 's what putting joe biden on the ticket is accepting defeat
nah hildawg did everything she could to make the american people hate her i mean who in gods green earth personally knows over 50 people who have allegedly committed sewer slide
now i wonder if we have n't again picked about the only candidate who could lose to donald trump they all lost to donald trump except for joe biden wth are you talking about
they ’ll blame progressives who are already voting for not showing up to vote
can you name one candidate that dropped out because of one bad debate
more reason to push the fact that the right to choose social security and other human rights are on the ballot lots of states have measures and closely contested local races to help drive people to the polls just need to get that message out
what 's troubling is being on the fence in the 1st place what will it take gee
you saw the poll that undecideds are trending biden after the debate right
maybe instead of going for the top down morale builder we should try rallying people around local candidates and getting them to vote up ballot instead of starting at the top and hoping the school boards get some sane people for once
i will try to start posting this from his rally in nc this is also biden he sounded terrible in the debate bumbling and his voice is too soft sounds pretty good here biden did nt go out on the debate stage and commit any crimes he did nt rape anyone i 'm not backing down and it does nt change my mind the felon on the left lied constantly and the old guy on the right looked old
yeah all he has done is deliver on most of promises and lead the country through extremely difficult and trying times one bad debate and anyone that supports him is literally marching the country to death camps because they are self serving terrible people get a grip
if it makes you feel any better the 3rd debate is hosted by fox news
there 's no way trump ends up doing the second debate he can only lose ground by doing so i fear it 'll take a miracle for things to turn around in even 5 months
worked out well in2016 wait no no it did n’t
ah yes inflation charts that exclude food and energy costs lol lmao
that 's the scary part dumb people with no conception of actual policy or economics are going to go by energy wittiness speed etc when those things are so much less relevant than the actual cabinet picks and policies surrounding a president biden is clearly the better choice in my mind and quite frankly did better in the debate if you deducted points for blatant falsehoods and lies but most people do n't think that way because most people are stupid i 'd imagine the majority of americans who are undecided or conservative did n't even blink at trump 's absurd claims like democrat states secretly execute babies because they love abortion so much they extended it into post birth and i feel so stupid just writing that out
it ’s because people who do n’t support trump and other maga people are not blind to reality biden is an old man and his motor functions are struggling is he a liability to the country not really does it suck to have to choose between a guy decent man that should long be retired or a bad faith and selfish clown also yes
the damage is done the ny times editorial board is calling for the biden campaign to step aside for the good of the country ffs our european allies are hyperventilating over how they will deal with russia under a second trump presidency ezra klein put it succinctly paraphrasing dems are going to have to decide if they actually want to win this thing or not because right now it feels like they 're staying on a derailing train simply because its less uncomfortable than getting off the train
are they voting for a dictator because of last night for real
i think i understand your point but what would him listening to unvarnished truth look like he s the man in the single best position to beat trump trump is unacceptable the person who can beat trump must give his all to beat him right
the pod save america guys made the point that doing the job as president is indeed different than campaigning as a candidate biden may manage the duties of the white house well and delegate responsibility well but the campaign trail needs more presentation and well done theater to build a rapport with voters especially those who are n't political junkies i think he can win the election but not unless he and his people find a way to turn this around
4 months left until the election is that really enough time for any other democrat to successfully campaign against trump he wo n't debate them would n't a late change of candidate after the first presidential debate has been held be very easy pickings for the trump campaign to cite democrats in disarray we are getting trump vs biden 2 0 in november all the democrats can hope for at this point is that people turn up in november out of fear of a trump return
replacing biden and losing the incumbent advantage is accepting defeat
if you 're talking about the gop primaries sure but the only person trump ever beat in an open election is hillary clinton and technically he did n't even beat her he won the electoral college not the popular vote
if that does n’t work add in young voters and 3rd party supporters they ’ll hunker down for 4 years and hope 2028 gives them brighter skies nominate another establishment lose again repeat in 4 years or maybe it ’ll take 3 losses to learn i thought 2016 would ’ve woke them up
all those progressives in the midwest and the south
this is n't about one bad debate this is about a persistent all encompassing concern among all swaths of the electorate regarding whether biden is too old to do the job his disastrous performance threw gasoline onto that fire and i ca n't think of any path forward for him
it was a bad debate that confirmed that joe biden is in deep mental decline
i hope biden wins but realize people are n't that thoughtful and logical there is an emotional component and i 'm not sure joe is appealing to that aspect it will be interesting how the young vote those concerned about the palastinians should be motivated to vote for biden as things will certainly be worse for the palastinians under trump it will be an interesting test to see how well they can think something through
the right to choose is n’t on the ballot joe said that in 2020 can people choose now he had congress for 2 years if the answer is no and nothing has changed you have your answer
i did n't i pray it is true
i 'm going to vote for him no matter what but kinda disingenuous to compare reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter to sparring communicating on the fly the debate was never going to change either of our minds but we have to start thinking about how important optics are to more apolitical voters and last night was a trainwreck in that department every convo that i 've had with that kind of voter moderate persuadable non maga about last night reeks of 2016 like apathy the trump amnesia combined with a total lack of enthusiasm outside niche echo chambers has me feeling the same deja vu and dread i did in nov eight years ago edit typo
you 're right this is far far worse
according to politifact he 's kept 28 % of his promises he has been president during difficult and trying times leadership has been questionable in terms of success of leadership the only people who need to get a grip are the people grasping onto myths fabrications and revisionist facts in an attempt to keep the charade up even though everyone who knows even a little bit was telling biden not to run almost 9 months ago when biden loses you 'll blame anyone and everyone instead of taking a hard look in the mirror
100 % despite trump lying incessantly and biden having better substance biden was so bad from a pure debate standpoint he did n't capitalize on trump 's many many missteps or hold his feet to the fire when he lied it was such a bad performance
i 'll still vote for him too and in fairness as bad as it was it could have been a lot worse this is that i 've seen but it comes at the end of a great answer to a question
the danger is they go rfk jr or just do n't vote at all
this is where i disagree current polling shows down ballot candidates in swing states and districts performing significantly better than biden by a wide margin a generic democratic also polls significantly better than biden additionally the gop has spent thousands of congressional man hours investigating and attacking him which all have been wasted if he stepped aside if biden had been selfless enough to bow out of race last year and allow the primary process play out this we would likely be rallying around a much younger more articulate leader with far less political baggage who would ’ve run circles around trump in a debate if we win in 2024 it wo n’t be because of biden it will be in spite of him as it stands we could gain seats in house and senate and still lose the presidency which would still allow trump to implement much of the project 2025 agenda in particular firing the subject matter experts who populate our executive agencies and replacing them with wholly unqualified sycophants
anyone who will still vote for biden today will vote for literally anyone else from the party anyone who is a gifted speaker and can go campaign like crazy until the election and get in front of every camera they can find has a way better chance than biden who will continue to be hidden away as much as possible and is almost entirely unable to effectively argue why he should be president again
but then they need to develop and enact a plan to win those people back and they just have n’t had the sauce so far it ’s crazy how little biden has been able to capitalize on the fact that trump was fucking indicted if biden does n’t drop he needs to fire some people
would n't a late change of candidate after the first presidential debate has been held be very easy pickings for the trump campaign to cite democrats in disarray oh please trump 's a fucking felon who tried to overturn the election who cares about disarray anymore biden 's campaign is done it 's over he ca n't possibly win most biden voters were just anti trump voters anyway any choice will do better than biden at this stage
i am begging biden stans to stop trying to bet the country 's future on the failing ability to string together sentences from the oldest presidential candidate ever
i think in the absence of biden a halfway decent candidate who produces any enthusiasm will have better odds than he does
whitmer gives us michigan michelle obama no real experience but plenty of name recognition and little negatives associated with her raskin motherfucker goes hard on trump 's crimes i do n't know the best answer fact is if biden runs dems lose the anti trump vote will carry over to whoever assumes the torch anyone voting biden now will vote for any dem we need someone to grab that extra few percent
biden has been trailing in the polls the whole year has the lowest approval rating of any president at this point in their term and nate silver gave him a 60 % chance to lose to trump that was all before the debate we lose nothing by switching candidates at this point
there is no incumbent advantage at this point stop the nonsense
losing the incumbent advantage his approval rating as president is 37 % it was over 50 % going into inauguration and for a year afterward and then tanked and has never recovered he does n't have an incumbent advantage he has an incumbent disadvantage for people having spent years feeling like their lives are worse off than they were before
i do n't buy that trump is a highly beatable candidate just about anybody who does n't have dementia can beat him
i ’m not sure that ’s the case all the indications we have say that trump loses to anyone with a pulse so putting up the only candidate with unclear pulse status could be the only situation where trump wins
honestly i think both are true damned if you do damned if you do n’t the incumbency advantage is vital but this might also be the one race possible where the side that replaces their old white man first may likely be the side that wins
yes gop primaries are elections and he cleared the field with ease both times you 're looking at it wrong if you think there is an only candidate who could lose to donald trump he 's beaten everybody except joe biden
they still blame 3rd party voters for 2016 even though more people voted conservative candidates but trump lost the popular by 3 million they do n't care about the truth or winning they just want to feel right
he is the commander in chief also and has access and decision making for nuclear options i do n’t want to sound rude but i do n’t think he ’s up to task now it ’s time to move over and retire
there was definitely a double standard biden just had to do ok and talk up what he 's already done trump could lie and make up bonkers shit with zero penalty against him from his base so long as he appeared somewhat maybe kind of sort of in control of his tendency to act like a child
well his nc speech today was great as well sotu as well as his presidency especially considering the razor thin majority and them losing the house
right because no one ever loses their train of thought freezes stutters uses the wrong word or loses their voice unless they ’re in “ deep mental decline ” just fucking stop with the manipulative bullshit
we had roe those first 2 years and we really did n’t have congress i ’m not talking about him presidential i ’m talking about individual states having literal abortion laws or candidates heavily contesting over abortion rights in local politics those things drives voters to the polls
fair point about the teleprompter my point is that he 's not always talking like that seriously i think he needed some hydration what is something that people can do to help those persuadable voters if anything
nonsense biden is not going to die and the vp is from the party rgb had cancer multiple times
28 % kept 9 % compromise 27 % in the works 31 % stalled 3 % broken i think 97 % partially fully or in process and 3 % failed is good but what do i know i 'm not a concern troll the only revisionist facts are acting like biden was a drooling zombie i wo n't say anything when biden proves people wrong like he did to the same concern trolls in 2020 because the concern trolls will magicly disappear into the wind
perhaps i mean biden is n't far behind trump in mi wi and pa all well within the margin of error across most polling four months away from the election so plenty of time for them to move in his favour granted as things currently stand they could be more likely to move further in trumps favour
michelle obama hates politics people need to stop suggesting she do it
agreed we are there he did his job in 2020 and his policies have put us back on track after covid we need a young strong candidate who can make the most out of the next 6 months and be the last line of defense agaisnt facism not the old man we saw last night democrats would look so much better by not doubling down and nominating a mentally unfit president like the republicans are any other candidate barring harris would wipe the floor with trump enthusiasm would skyrocket since well it 's all but dead now it was on life support before this but fuck me it feels utterly hopeless right now
nate silver has zero system for predicting elections
there 100 % is anyone believing otherwise is not being truthful americans have short memories and it ’s june and based on the hysterics here the memory is shorter this cycle across the board
and has access and decision making for nuclear options and you 're willing to give that to donald trump again
how many undecided voters do you think watched that speech today
with all respect nobody cares about his speech today there 's zero chance that speech breaks through the wall of noise his horrible performance has created
he had two teleprompters today in nc
that does n’t break the narrative that he has just enough marbles left to read a teleprompter
it ’s not manipulative bullshit ofc people lose their train of thought but what happened last night is not acceptable he is just not fit mentally for the presidency he was unable to form coherent sentences at times you are entitled to your opinion but the dems will not win in november if they continue with joe biden
he did have congress though if biden ca n’t keep two senators in his own party in line he ’s not fit to make decisions for 325 million people secondly him being president has n’t kept states from banning abortion that ’s my point he ’s put up zero fight and has done nothing to change the current of abortion regression it ’s not on the ballot
bold of you to assume biden 's vp has any relevance when he 's on track to lose against trump in november
do you want to address the terrible polls and his terrible approval rating or do you think you do n't have to because one dumb twitter guy got namedropped in addition to them
how did that incumbent advantage work out for bush sr or for trump in 2020 but more to the point we are in uncharted territory there 's never been a threat like trump and there 's never been a candidate who presents as poorly as biden does this year
i see no incumbent advantage being demonstrated in any polls or any election forecasts and joe 's horrific performance last night will do nothing but make him lose even more ground in the polls
at this point whatever “ incumbent advantage ” biden has is severely outweighed by the “ appearing like he should be in a retirement home ” disadvantage data polling biden vs any other democrat politician against trump as well as down the ballot candidates also bears this out
the incumbent advantage is roughly 2 % one of my best friends has a chapter in his dissertation estimating this in every race across every state at every level for the past 70 years that 2 % was instantly obliterated last night
this is an unprecedented situation and those keys are pure copium and literally the only positive indicator biden has going for him at this point
absolutely not trump is such a danger to our democracy that we must support a candidate who can actually defeat him after what i saw last night i do not think biden is that candidate
nobody is undecided it ’s just a matter of whether they will vote or not
the point is he ’s still got it he just had a bad night there ’s 4 months left of campaigning a convention and another debate to make it up
undecided voters in a swing state and gotv enthusiasm care about his speech today which is more important than a national debate that never decides anything
so that s how the vast majority of his and any other candidates campaign would look from here on out doing that well and showing energy and going to different battleground states will appease many people trump even on teleprompter will be a disaster in the next few months
it shows energy he has a solid record for those that like him his supporters can write it off as one bad night the more great speeches he gives with a teleprompter like everyone other candidate would use
exact same words as 2020 primary and general concern trolls were wrong then and they are wrong now
sinema i can agree on with you but manchin is from west virginia that state is soo social right
he won before and he ’s going to win again
and keeps a full presidential schedule without a problem
nate silvers system is the equivalent of going to a casino hitting 21 in blackjack one time and then thinking you 're nostradamus
biden was attacked for being just as senile and he won up until a week ago fox news was still manipulating photos and videos to keep the dementia farce up
polling that ’s become progressively worse since 2016 or where papers and pollsters are deliberately misrepresenting the polls and undermining their own accuracy because it gets clicks those polls
at this point whatever “ incumbent advantage ” biden has is severely outweighed by the “ appearing like he should be in a retirement home ” same attacks worked in 2020 right
that 2 % was instantly obliterated last night sure we 'll be on to the next disaster in two weeks it 's june and it 's patently obvious folks ca n't remember the last two weeks let alone the last few years of attacks on biden
and what of 2016 everyone keeps making excuses about how this person would win or that person would lose but no one else has a reliable system for elections so in the end it does n't matter what they think
and you think they are going to pull some winning candidate out of a hat and prepare a campaign barely a few months before the election or are you proposing somebody
not at all true but even if we go with that argument biden last night certainly did n't give them a reason to vote
or more likely 4 months of campaigning a convention and another debate for him to produce another dozen embarrassing moments he was n't a great campaigner at his best and he 's far from his best now i was saying all this same crap right up until last night now i bow to the inevitable if he runs we 'll lose i hear a lot of liberals taking a second look at rfk jr for god 's sake
this sounds like cope debates have had measurable impacts on polling numbers before and candidates can use that momentum i mean think of literally the first televised one with jfk and nixon
no it does n’t everyone knows when he has a team of speech writers give him words to say he can say them it ’s does n’t change the narrative that when it ’s just joe biden speaking he ’s a husk of his former self
i sincerely hope you are right but i 'm not so sure i 'll be voting for him pretty much no matter what of course that said i think the right move is to swap him i do n't really care who with tbh kamala pete gavin warren whoever it takes
anyone who thinks that based on last nights performance is lying to themselves
biden was attacked for being just as senile and he won yes because there was n't evidence now there is front page of the nyt website today has 5 editorials mostly from liberal writers all saying he should step aside if you ca n't keep paul krugman you are n't going to keep the swing state undecided voters
look man i wanna believe as much as you do but i want to win more than i want to believe joe failed us last night everybody with eyes can see it i 'm angry and we need to move on to somebody who can effectively vie with trump
actually the pollsters nailed the 2022 midterms the media bought into the red wave narrative but that really was n't the numbers were saying granted you 'd actually have to look at the numbers to know that which involves reading and comprehending and living in objective reality
i ’m not even sure what point you ’re trying to make biden ’s age did him no favors in the 2020 race which should have been a slam dunk after trumps disastrous covid response which he just narrowly won and it certainly is n’t doing him any favors in this one he ’s just arrived at 81 years old after spending the last 4 in one of the most stressful and mentally taxing jobs on earth the difference is not subtle it ’s not even an “ attack ” against him it ’s just reality
i 'm concerned that if we stick with biden no matter what we 'll end up with a candidate who fails to get out the vote in swing states where it 's needed the most last night america saw a man who looks like he 's too old to do the job we need someone who is n't
he did n’t trump gave them reasons to vote against him
you did n’t watch his speech he ’s fine
jfk did not win that debate in fact nixon was roundly lauded for his performance there the “ jfk won by vibes ” was a story concocted years later after his assassination
doing campaign stops and giving prepared speeches does n’t show energy it does n’t show quick thinking on your feet and being articulate he quite frankly did n’t have that in 2020 and that ’s prob low on a lot for a lot of people ’s priorities for being president trump has trouble even with teleprompters but giving speeches and campaign stops at least shows and the ability to do the job for those that want a reason to vote for him
the schedule is published every day
same nyt that ’s been attacking biden with questionable polls with siena misrepresenting the data or just flat out lying yeah i ’m good anytime biden did anything good there ’d be a similar number of articles on how this is actually bad for biden
biden did and can again the idiocy of trying to swap in whitmer or newsom or mayor pete is breathtakingly idiotic
no they did n’t nyt does n’t get a say in polling after their debacle with siena and other very recent credibility issues
my bet is that he will step aside at a convenient time after the election he had a bad debate but he 's by far still the best option to win this election and there is no time for anyone to even start a campaign right now and no debates
trump sounded great since no one called him on all his lies the moderators did n't and biden did n't
you did n't get the point a teleprompter speech is n't going to erase the image he left people with last night and the voters who will decide this are n't going to see that speech anyway do you really think we should roll the dice that his next debate wo n't be embarrassing too because by then it will be to late
nyt is not the same as their opinion writers who have been solidly pro biden sorry but if you do n't see last night as a colossal failure you 're being as delusional as maga and i 'm not saying it means he ca n't be a good president the presidency is n't about being able to make split second decisions and having an encyclopedic command of facts it 's about sound judgments and strategies and he seems to still have those qualities but i am saying that he 's not going to win the votes he needs to win people who solidly backed him now have concerns including me and every co worker and friend i 've talked to today so how the hell we going to win the undecideds and if you think the next 4 months are n't going to be just a parade of more embarrassing clips and performances you have n't been paying attention
k hope you 're right but there is n't a shred of evidence to give me confidence you are lots of copium
the hill is an opinion piece that did n't do any analysis message box news tell me more this pretty much confirms you just hunt for headlines you like from any source without reading an iota of it the prospect article is n't even about the midterms the fortune article is the only one here even worth considering and it basically cherry picked a few bad polls out of an ocean of good accurate ones read more from actual experts and less forums fringe blogs
he did n't just have a bad debate he demonstrated that when confronted with a dangerous enemy of america he loses track of the message and brings up the enemy 's talking points unprompted i think we 're all feeling like he 's going to step aside after the election which means a biden harris ticket ultimately becomes just a harris ticket and if that 's the thought people have going into november this is n't really a biden vs trump race it 's harris vs trump i do n't think we win that one
he reminded everyone of his lies even his supporters know he is lying everyone wanted roe v wade overturned that reminds many why they want to vote against trump same w his jan 6 comments heck even just lying about golf championships reminds everyone about lying and there ’s also the fact he did n’t answer most questions people notice that stuff too trump did terrible but biden did worse because he came off as looking older and less coherent in the way he spoke i get that i ’m not sure what would have happened if biden did a good job nobody would be saying trump should drop out maybe dems would feel over confident and now the concern of losing may motivate them who knows long way to go long way it will be close
far from the biggest consequence from this ruling but i ca n't help but think about all the law school students who just finished their administrative law class and now a big chunk of what they learned is completely obsolete in all seriousness this is one of the most consequential and far reaching rulings in a while it overturns 40 years of precedence and refining of chevron and replaces the subject matter expertise of regulatory agencies with the scattershot system of politicized circuit courts cases that chevron would have solved relatively quickly will take much longer now with every judge putting their own spin on things given how much right wing judges love nationwide stays a few wackos in the fifth circuit could gut important regulations pending a supreme court smackdown assuming the court does n't lurch even further to the right it will be time consuming for the courts and potentially dangerous for us
this is the real story if there ’s a smidge of potential for oil under yr house the oil companies will drill day and night to get at it as happened in the dfw burbs at least nothing can stop them as the supreme court will say “ free enterprise ” local politicians will be bought as the supremes also legalized bribery of local officials those who bought homes on wheels may have the last laugh
so what they 're saying is subject matter experts are overrated and science should be based in political ideology
ca n’t congress just pass a bill giving federal agencies the power to make their own regulations would that fix this
its why they ruled on gifts earlier some soctus judges are partying this weekend for free
from cbs news politics reporter melissa quinn in a blockbuster decision friday the supreme court overruled a 40 year old decision that directed federal courts to defer to agencies ' interpretation of unclear laws enacted by congress the landmark ruling from the court which divided 6 3 along ideological lines curtails the regulatory power of federal agencies and is expected to restrict the government 's ability to impose regulations on areas like the environment health care and the workplace the decision marks a major victory for the conservative legal movement which has long called for dismantling the framework that arose out of the 1984 ruling in a case known as chevron v national resources defense council the justices did just that with their ruling in a pair of cases involving a 2020 federal regulation that required owners of vessels in the atlantic herring fishery to pay for monitors while they 're at sea here is why the decision in those two cases is so significant
this is the court republicans gave us
our supreme court is corrupt plain and simple so is our government we need a reset or revolt
almost as significant as citizens united
we ca n’t have a supreme court changing the laws every time one side or the other gains an edge
expand and pack most of their agenda depends on the sc overturning precedent
stuff like this is why i do n’t understand the people who are still supporting biden as the nominee after last night even if he stays in and manages to scrape by and save the presidency from the rapist felon it is not enough nothing is going to change with this supreme court if we actually want meaningful change we need someone who is going to energize the base and give independents an alternative choice that will affect down ballot races enough that we can make legislative and judicial changes maga obstruction and fascist creep is going to keep handicapping progress with joe at the top
no the legislature is the body to make laws in federal work i ’m with the doi you need a law to provide instruction to do something or tell someone to not do something the reason they said the courts will get slammed is now any interpretation we make on what an entity can or can not do can be challenged in a court your new construction at your house is probably not worth challenging the regulations that uranium mine you want to put in that utah wilderness is going to find a sympathetic judge and become an open pit mine
oh right they had to wait till after making crazy judgements to get paid tips tips before service is bad
yes god forbid we no longer have an activist court and one that actually rules according to the constitution
what power does the president have over the supreme court at best he can nominate new members which must happen
keep in mind the president has no control over the supreme court who have judges given lifetime appointments this current supreme court was put in place by trump who pushed through 3 justices and tipped the scales to the republicans who aim to dismantle our government mitch mcconnell famously blocked obama from putting a new supreme court justice on the court saying it was “ just before am election and would be inappropriate ” then the republicans allowed trump to put a justice on the court just before the election regardless of what they said to obama so basically they just manipulate the system to their advantage to continue dismantling the system even if you do n’t like biden i do n’t love him i would never support trump or any republican they only plan to keep pushing through abuses to us citizens because they are bought by major corporations and billionaires and put their needs before citizens because of trump they overturned roe vs wade allow the supreme court to take money gifts of gratitude from the people they help in court being biased weakened the ability for the federal government to govern the states that will be causing irreparable harm to the environment
thinking anyone else has the potential to win is delusional at this point until joe is no longer able to run he is our best bet to preventing things from getting even worse i do nt want him as president i wish we had a much younger more fiery president willing to do what it takes to stop this countries internal collapse by the corrupt scotus but we do nt have one on the ballet and jumping horses 4 months away from the election wo nt help anyone right now
it ’s an express rejection of democracy they ’re claiming that judges can veto the people ’s policy choices without having to explain why those choices are illegal or unconstitutional they just have to justify that a different choice preferred by the judge would also be legal
yeah but would n’t congress passing a law that says agencies can set their own regulations fix that i guess i ’m confused unless each individual regulation has to be a law
tips before service is a bribe tips after service is a gift
alito and thomas wo n't last forever if trump wins they can retire and be replaced like what happened with kennedy
the executive is the enforcement arm of the government if the supreme court say banned abortion federally then the executive branch can choose to not enforce that it keeps the supreme court in their place of limiting power instead of exerting it
missing my point this is more than just about the presidency the house and the senate do have the power to bring change 9 supreme court justices is not a constitutional requirement not going to get more than that with a meager majority and yes i know this is n’t a favorable environment for the senate but we are n’t doing ourselves any favors for down ballot races with a ticket that provides no enthusiasm for the top worst case scenario he loses and we get alito and thomas seats secured for conservatives for another generation and the risk of 7 2 should anything else happen
also missed my point see response above
it 's not a people 's policy choice when unelected officials are making laws this makes that power stay with our representatives which is why it is one of the most pro democracy moves in a long time
by giving them blanket authority you give them essentially the law needed to regulate congress can not give an agency or anyone else the ability to make their own laws
it does not limit the power of agencies to make regulation even slightly it does not return any power to our representatives congress always had the power to define executive rule making authority over any given subject it passes a law on if congress does n’t like how regulators are doing things it can revise the law to clarify that point this ruling just gives courts the final say over questions that are purely policy choices rather than keeping courts limited to their proper role of determining whether something is legal it is declaring the supremacy of the judicial branch over the executive branch on questions which are supposed to be left to the political process people pick the president if the president ’s agents pass regulations which people dislike they can pressure the administration to fire those regulators and change the rules or elect a new president if that does n’t work but if judges with lifetime appointments are the ones ultimately deciding policies there is no democratic recourse
thank you for clarifying what a mess this will be
if you 're right that is a problem that is not what i read from the original case however the judicial branch is about limiting power rather than deciding policy though that is why they are separated from enforcement if they started seizing power and creating policy say banning abortion they still have no control of enforcement that is why it is important they stay separate and the importance of the difference between limiting power and exerting power
6 3 but not the way you 'd expect
the court is siding with the people who tried to overthrow our democracy
the conservative wing of the gop seem to have no real problems with the fact that some of trump 's followers tried to overthrow the government they are an arm of the christo fascist theocracy trump will preside over when he wins the election deregulation of all laws protecting the environment will be repealed one by one trump will most likely not stand trial as leonard leo 's federalist society judge cannon will slow walk until it 's finally dismissed biden 's legacy will be presiding over the attempted extirpation of the palestinians and his inability to accept that he should have never run for a second term now america faces the real possibility of many democrats being tied to biden and losing their elections too
democrats might have to do the same thing in january 2025 to defend the republic if trump wins
i think it 's been well established that the court does n't give a singular fuck about democracy
kb jackson is an arm of christo fascist theocracy
how i know you 're full of it is because biden 's legacy for you is entirely based on a foreign nation you mentioned nothing about domestic policy or health care or schools his only legacy will be one nation in the world when people say biden 's only legacy will be palestinian death i assume they have a non american agenda
would n't be the same thing
of course why would they they are n't elected and do n't have term limits
she 's not a conservative you can look it up yourself
i think that is literally their point
85 million is pocket change for the housing hoarding hedge funds buying up all the housing
biden 's speech today was coherent and he sounded great what the fuck happened last night
anyone else tired of baby steps when rent is around 2 000
i do n’t care if he mumbles on stage when he has a cold i want four more years of this please
today vice president kamala harris and hud acting secretary adrianne todman announced that the biden harris administration is awarding 85 million in grant funding for the pathways to removing obstacles to housing pro housing program pro housing aims to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation and lower housing costs pro housing provides grant funding to communities actively taking steps and demonstrating progress in addressing needless local housing barriers to housing production winners of the pro housing competition will update state and local housing plans revise land use policies streamline the permitting process for housing construction and take other actions to create more housing forward communities grants will also be used to preserve existing affordable housing units provide development subsidies to create new affordable units and increase access to homeownership “ president biden and i believe that every american deserves affordable housing so they have a roof over their head and a place to call home that is why we have a plan to build millions of new units of affordable housing in communities all across our nation which will bring down the cost of housing for renters and help more americans buy a home ” said vice president harris “ today i am proud to announce that we are taking a critical step forward by investing 85 million to help more than 20 communities throughout our country remove barriers to building more affordable housing ” common barriers to housing identified in the pro housing applications include the high cost of land and development lack of available units underutilized vacant land and property aging housing stock inadequate infrastructure displacement pressures risks of extreme weather or environment hazards and outdated land use policies and permitting policies and processes the demand was substantial hud received considerable interest in the first round of pro housing funding applications were submitted from more than 175 communities representing a wide variety of demographics geographies and population sizes across 47 states and territories successful applicants demonstrated a commitment to eliminating barriers to housing and progress toward creating more housing forward communities the winners of pro housing are actively deploying strategies to boost housing supply reform local regulations incentivize development prevent displacement and encourage community driven solutions given the broad interest and urgent need to address housing supply applicants will be provided technical assistance to address housing costs later this year hud will release an additional 100 million in funding available for round two of the competition the president also included an additional 100 million for this program in his fy 25 budget list of recipients for this round is included in the press release here is the fact sheet the following is an abridged list of bullet points more on each in the press release this announcement fulfills a commitment made in the administration ’s housing supply action plan and builds on sweeping actions to reduce barriers boost housing supply and lower costs including leveraging discretionary grant programs to encourage state and local action to build more housing updated guidance for converting commercial property to housing provided low cost capital for housing finalized the low income housing tax credit lihtc “ income averaging ” rule streamlined and modernized the home program invested in making our nation ’s affordable housing more energy efficient and resilient published a 235 million funding opportunity to support manufactured housing communities increasing loan limits for title i manufactured housing made historic investments in homebuilding and community development in indian country expanded access to financing for homes with accessory dwelling units adus
but no let 's go with the felon
that 's a good move hopefully sky high rent falls across the nation
how about not spending billions on developing mars before fixing our planet like anyone hear of levittown long island look it up and let these billionaires off the backs of workers get land in areas where ’s there ’s lots and build and develop communities for the people that ca n’t afford over inflated housing prices yep talking to you musk father of the year help earthlings now not worry about your legacy in the future and start by amazon paying its workers right instead of lauren sanchez being in the news in ridiculous priced outfits and trips yeah keep rubbing it your workers faces wht you can afford and they ca n’t and see wht happens
they 'll start the increase by vacating the white house
it ’s absolutely terrifying that she would be president if he died during his term
d or did introduce the in december of last year a bill intended to tackle the issue of hedge fund owned homes but it still needs more support
a combination of being overprepped with too many talking points and having a cold
bad drug cocktail mix maybe trump 's mixologist put in too much uppers biden did n't get enough
while trump vacates his bowels
that may or may not be a possibility by november but the biden harris admin can continue to push policy until jan 20th may as well put that time to some use
not half as terrifying as trump becoming president again
it 's a step in the right direction so we have to keep the senate and take back the house
yeah they should have focused on the vibe not on cramming him full facts
we should ’ve called a timeout or halftime so he could do a couple biden bumps
indeed the presidential election usually gets the most attention but yes we must n't forget the senate and house elections nor state city and other local elections that take place each year as well
you really think she ’s qualified to be president have you listened to her the fact that you are asking me this question is also terrifying putin would have her for breakfast
i 'm asking you to provide an example do you have any or not
btw what has she done as vp if you can ever find her
i ’m not gon na make a list she ’s not qualified just by the way she articulate herself much like her boss and i m not a trumper this is by far the worst choice i ever seen
here 's the link to the post you 're on i think you missed what 's in front of you
in the amount of time you spent deflecting one would hope you could have articulated at least one point against her
i think we all need to cool down and remember that biden has put together an incredible team that is making all of this happen if something happens to him and she steps up that team still exists he is not doing this alone and neither would she
so no examples or evidence okay
i would argue that wearing a mask is a constitutional right if you are expected to create your own personal privacy when in a public setting how else would you do that but wear a mask i ’m pretty sure it ’s already illegal to conceal your face when committing a crime in california anyway all this is for is so big brother can identify protesters edit spelling error
the guardian 's article on the la and ny mayor 's researching banning masks at protests text as%20covid%20cases%20rise%20across synagogue%20that%20made%20intern
pro scientologist mayor against real science should be the headline
sounds like what would be some expected republican legislation circa 2014 rioting looting if any almost always happens at the end of the protests when its dark it 's so intense during those times you could n't get to a would be masker to safely easily detain them anyway a true criminal in the act will cover their face regardless of the law have we learned nothing from some of our useless gun laws many citizens that are still covid conscious in 2024 are also those who refuse to be complicit in the us suport of israel this is nothing more than a way to ensure ease of identification of peaceful protesters and keep covid conscious citizens from protesting a truly sickening right wing esque agenda
ok rioters still should n't be allowed to conceal their identities
yep during the covid anti mask meltdown i was reminding everyone i could that it was less than a few years after everyone was freaking out about facial recognition technology in public places conservative conspiracy theorists and mainstream republicans gutted every citizen 's right to privacy from facial recognition tech because they got so emotionally scrambled and it was a huge thing they used to worry about now being bare faced in public is something they are trying to mandate by law smh
add detail to your comment
cloth mask reduce infection for the user by 50 % and protects others by 60 % surgical mask reduce infection for the user by 70 % and others by 80 % n 95 mask reduce infection for the user by 85 % and other by 90 %
all coverings help direct or deflect if not stop it from penetrating how much depends on the material and layers even cotton catches big droplets and slows down anything expelled through causing it to drop to the ground faster exposure then depends on how close you are the direction of the cough sneeze etc your own body ’s defenses and many other factors
of course n95 or higher is better but any covering is better than none and this is coming from someone who masks up with n99s
makes no sense covid is still here because idiot people do n't care about community selfish idiots
i ’m guessing they ’re saying that the way the headline is written is like it ’s a mask ban because the mayor is suggesting covid is n’t real that ’s not the case the mask ban was for protests so police can id and to intimidate protestors
it 's not like the issue has n't been debated and studied all over the world for the past 5 or so years
also it ’s already illegal to wear a mask when committing or intending to commit a crime in california
so is a shot of tear gas to facial skin
kinda worse imo instead of being mostly anti intellectually driven it ’s explicitly malicious against leftist protesters
thanks tomato tomahto as far as mask bans are concerned
i would flip that and say most are not covering with a malicious intent
i agree it ’s more malicious it is just like when phx pd tried to make any blm protestors into a gang and they were trying to arrest and charge with gang enhancement for people who were there but not blocking roadways etc that stuff actually saw ammon bundy defend the black lives matter protesters as he saw some parallels to his issue with the bureau of land management and government overreach
you mean the people who respect science and medicine s
covid pandemic has been over no it has n't and 99 9 % of people have stopped wearing masks which ensures it 'll keep going they are n't wearing them to the store or out in daily life well i do i do n't want to contribute to another wave of covid 19 or bird flu or any other epidemic i 'm also allergic to some pollens tobacco smoke perfume and antifreeze fumes so i need to carry masks anyway but they do put it on top go riot commit crime and protest i ca n't do much with my disabilities but if you 're protesting it can protect you from retaliation and i do n't think people should be barred from protest due to cs cn oc etc allergies or asthma where people may need to carry masks to safely protest
it 's awful to see how far the left has fallen continuously sliding a little further to the right with each new conflict witnessing dems now as covid deniers and turning a blind eye or even supporting genocide via complacency and ignorance is insane
what a stupid full of shit bat shit opinion i was going to argue but why bother
people are still getting sick people are still suffering people are still dying that 's not debatable now you could argue that it 's no longer a pandemic because it 's endemic that is debatable but that does n't mean that masking is n't necessary at least for some people it just means it will still be necessary at least for some people for the forseeable future and it means it a good thing for the rest of us to make it safer for everyone and to fight the stigma against people who need to mask
seems like you just made your whole argument with your first sentence alone it 's weak
if masks were being used as you describe them then i would agree with you but masks are n't being used as you describe and they are being used to hide identities to constantly cause chaos in america no thanks
' constant chaos in america ' knee deep in shit on this post the sky is always falling these days
could n’t happen to a more deserving guy
just go to jail already
a how to make toilet wine q what is the top search in steve bannons browser history
at least he 'll be forced to bathe every once in a while good luck layering five prison jumpsuits though
where 's your god now steve open wide
watch him try and run away to mexico and be thwarted by the border lol
finally a crumb of good news i ’m starving
i suspect he has not prepared himself getting clean of non prescription medication drug withdraw sucks in prison i predict at least a few lonely nights for steve crying quietly in the dark with just his demons to keep him company
these folks sure do enjoy throwing you a carrot occasionally between beatings with the stick
at least he gets to beat one off knowing that the administrative state has been gutted before he goes to jail
hope this really happens on monday
why was n't he in custody did he post some kind of bond to be out until it was time to report to prison do n't if trump is elected he will pardon bannon and all the other trump related convicts
never fear trump will save him
well at least they got this one right
will he flee to russia
will this dude just fucking suck start a shotgun already geez
the next search was “ prison pocket ”
straining some shit out will make toilet wine i predict he will do a lot of that soon
there 's no bottom for a republican court
this is it guys we lost the fight against climate change we 're fucked
good job on the sierra club for condemning the ussc decision to overturn the precedent set in the chevron case
they made their bed they are a neo liberal tourism company cosplaying as an environmental organization we ’ve been screwed since bernie lost the primary in 2016 they should have been ringing alarm bells when hillary “ won ” the primary instead they enthusiastically endorsed her hillary was on the board of walmart for 12 years she does not care about climate change she helped create it the sierra club lost all credibility years ago source
is there any hope any at all please god please let there be hope
sounds like the sierra club could n't come up with enough enticing graft to swing the votes
not true at all congress can not enact legislation to insulate itself from the courts so if enough people care countrywide change is possible this type of attitude wo n’t fix anything though
or just craft legislation that does n’t have ambiguity
relying on common decency and respect for your fellow man and the planet y’ all live on is not a winning tactic against republicans or republican bought judges
exactly we do n't need the executive branch unelected law enforcement interpreting law with no oversight it took decades to get this far people started their careers and retired all under chevron we elect leaders for a reason they can make laws and if they ca n't well then too bad elect new leaders let the steamroller of democracy roll over their careers
i 'm sure republican state representatives will totally let that happen s
or they did they left those details up the the agency like things normally were done but this court decided nah be more specific knowing full well nothing will be done and everything now has to go through court
for 40 years legislation has been written to take advantage of chevron we would need to rewrite 40 years worth of laws with highly detailed regulations and apportionments these detailed regulations are written by congress who as we all know has no fucking clue about their own jobs let alone having any expertise in any other area other than politics
i 'm still voting for biden but whitmer would be a great consensus candidate if he decided to bow out
i mean yeah she ’s not gon na be like “ he fucking sucks shoulda been me up there ” if they do replace him it will be over weeks and everything with his replacement will have to be worked out behind closed doors
she has to play the game if she wants a shot in 2028
tout yourself as the person who can save the country time to jump in as the alternative please
i said elsewhere and will say here not having biden as the nominee would have been great four years ago or two years ago or even one year ago but swapping him out after that debate would be a goddamn disaster yeah he was absolutely horrible at the beginning and mediocre at best later on but there are two narratives here for him staying or leaving staying our guy is old but knows his stuff and one debate performance does n't indicate a failure to lead leaving our guy is old and can not continue to lead because of that debate performance and here are the competing narratives from the gop staying their guy is a corpse he 's old and does n't know what he 's doing he 's destroyed america thing is this narrative is something they 've run on for 6 years it failed them the last time it failed them at the sotu it is a narrative that does not manage to punctuate into demographics they need to sway when compared to their own candidate now this is leaving trump was so powerful and commanding that he caused sleepy joe to quit before the election even began he has defeated the democrats ' most lauded politician and the sitting president to boot with nothing more than a few hours and telling it like it is look how the democrats flee in despair that 's a new narrative that 's a strong narrative about a historical black swan event that has never occurred in the nation 's history biden quits because he flubbed a debate and the national party abandoned him absolute landslide for trump does n't matter who gets put up there the powerful strongman connotations alone sweep demographics who now view trump as the guy who is so good that he wins elections with a smirk this may well be a death march but it may also be a footnote and a circle the wagons moment and biden has another debate and other opportunities to show it was a flub while trump has a felony sentencing hearing coming up switch biden out now and the only news story for five months will be about how strongman trump can defeat any foe and has taken down both clinton and biden and will easily defeat anyone else and make us strong on the world stage and yaddayaddatotalnonsensebutconvincingnonsensetodisaffectedmoderates i 'd rather accept the present reality of joe old lol which has long ago run out of steam and even with a second wind wo n't go on for long versus trump is power democrats quake in fear which would be a novel and convincing narrative to a lot of people
i hate so much that we ’ve gotten to the point where everyone has to pretend what they saw last night is perfectly normal
pete buttigieg in 2028 if you can find a more articulate educated service oriented individuatl with an impressive military record that speaks 8 languages and gets almost instant respect sitting at any table dinner or news let me know
i do n't think public comments like this are indicative of anything this is just toeing the party line while other discussions are happening in private people like whitmer and newsom will publicly support biden until unless he drops out the ones who call for biden to decline the nomination are not going to be the ones replacing him if when he does
gretchen whitmer and newsom both stand by biden because they know how the game works you do n't switch out biden this late in the game he is still the best chance of beating trump they get it and they will keep fighting for that until the end also it 's biden 's decision anything but supporting him would look terrible for anyone who wants to run for something in the future
president biden had a bad debate but his opponent was far worse in both terms of fitness and quality it 's still an easy choice on who to vote for an older statesman or a cunning and conniving candidate who 's been convicted of 34 felonies and has wide range of scandals and immoral actions
he answered all the questions and stood for 90 whole minutes what else do you people want
good on gretch one bad debate gets a meh from me would have been great if biden were better at improvising over cnn screwing up the mic cut off and fact checking but hey it is what it is
i may be an optimistic but biden is fine its just a bad debate night the overreaction will not last more than a week or two but i would sub in gretchen or pete as vp
that says a lot about her and anyone who thinks she should replace him if she thought he did well her standards are n't high enough to be a nominee
yes circle your wagons around the person playing with matches and gasoline and then either act shocked when he catches fire or say “ i knew that would happen ” despite not doing anything about it some governors and senators or former living presidents need to have the courage to tell biden he ’s hurting more than helping
why are they gaslighting us
spit balling here nobody is excited about harris what if whitmer is vp
read that as debate mucous ’ seemed fitting
these people keep crapping in our mouths and telling us it ’s pumpkin pie this nation is embarrassing for these two being the best it can offer america lost last night
there is n't really a consensus candidate here because the main dem possibility really well known through most of the country is kamala and she 's less popular than biden i 'm from new jersey i remember when bob torricelli had to ' depart ' from the senate race and they exhumed frank lautenberg to be a senator until he died they do n't have a frank lautenberg for this race
this is me as well i would like biden to step aside but i vote for him over trump any day of the week
she is my governor and she is amazing but we would be naive to think that she would n't be vilified within the week and made out to be a weak candidate by the media with the same people complaining about biden complaining about her
100 % i know a vote for biden is a vote for stability and a functioning executive branch even if stability looks like kamala takes over sometime in 2025 i prefer presidents who are part of a strong team vs one man dictators or superheroes i would have loved a dem primary that pushed whitmer to a national stage i fear if she swaps in late that trump will hit her hard for her covid response a tad draconian but she would be better than newsom he ’s too california and therefore easily painted as out of touch to the average union worker in the rust belt
i 'm from michigan and i love big gretch i 'd be absolutely pumped if she 'd step in for biden or eventually run in 4 years she 's great
i 've been hoping for whitmer 2028 i 'd be thrilled to vote for her this year as well i 'm still happy to vote for biden he 's done a far better job than i ever dreamed he would
what about newsom or buttigieg
it would still be a significant risk to change candidates this late especially without a primary but they could vastly improve the democratic ticket by just biting the bullet dropping kamala harris and replacing her with whitmer or newsom in most cases vps do n’t really move the needle but this is very obviously the exception and regardless of the reasoning harris is just deeply unpopular they have n’t held the convention yet which around when the vp usually gets announced so the timing would still be typical the biggest problem would just be getting harris to walk away gracefully
there are 18 weeks left until election day if biden is going to be replaced it better be soon
well if she did it would be an absolute lie it ’s just sad how disengaged most the population is objectively biden has achieved more legislation and implemented more national directives than any president in the last 30 years
plus loyalty now means party support if or if we 're being honest when they run in 2028
she should have he did suck he was an absolute embarrassment to democrats
no one 's going to publicly jump in as the alternative not unless and until biden announces he 's changed his mind about running and by the time that happens a lot of maneuvering will have happened behind the scenes and he 'll be making an endorsement as part of his announcement
that 's not how you do the branding you have biden have a sudden unforeseen health issue that remains undisclosed this allows him to be a king maker and announce that whitmer is replacing him with harris still as vp everyone wins but trump who is fucked
if the republicans were smart they would be using all this to say the alternatives to biden are terrified to verse trump in november the alternatives know that if they lose to trump that their political career is over so they are ducking trump in hopes biden wins or trump terms out of the oval office
i do nt think its perfectly normal its just they still rather have this administration with an old man at front who will still push through democratic policies and also still have the chance to vote for someone else in 2028 verus voting for a guy who speaks confidently but has said things like he will be a dictator and that s he owed a third term
nothing about the last 8 years of politics has been “ normal ” the first debate in 2020 was equally a shit show just for different reasons and it was more agreed that biden won that clusterfuck but nothing about it was good or sane
i ’m sure whitmer ’s answer is simply to not cause more panic and play nice in case biden does step down but yeah to everyone yelling “ i’m still voting for biden ” he lost the election last night replacing him costs us nothing at this point
they 're also both potential replacements and getting on biden 's bad side would n't help in that case either
he is absolutely not the best chance after that anyone but kamala and warren would be the best chance at this point biden trump win in a landslide and it ’s terrifying
biden is not the best chance of beating trump after last night
who is voting for biden that would n't be voting for gretch or gavin the only reason to vote for biden is to not vote for trump the only reason why they would n't replace him with whitmer or newsom is if they 're already considering this race lost and do n't want to ruin their chances in 28
to do those two things good
he said words whether they were answers to questions is up for debate
if only he had practiced blinking he would ’ve won
it ’s not just one bad debate but i guess flavoraid is tasty and free so
it ’s not cnn ’s fault that biden was a fucking major disaster if he ca n’t handle an hour and a half he ca n’t handle 4 years the entire debate was predicated on his rules and trump made him seem like a chump big l for joe
maybe he just needs 4 years to rest then come out strong in 2028
tbh i think there are 2 reasons first one thing is delivering as a president and another one is campaigning biden is definitely too old for campaigning but he has proven his ability to deliver the economy is slowly improving whitmer knows this and does n't give the debate too much importance and second if she were to run as an alternative it would n't be wise to openly criticize the incumbent that 's why no one 's saying a word
the article says she did n’t mention the debate just that she was praising what biden has done as president it ’s definitely damage control but for the most part all left leaning media and politicians that have talked about the debate agree it was a horrible performance
i know of a governor sitting in california who has been groomed for his opportunity since birth
they 're gon na do that anyway though
i fear if she swaps in late trump will hit her hard for her covid response a tad draconian i 'm not sure if i agree in a time of crisis the states look to the federal government for leadership advice and help on how to respond instead of helping trump did n't do that he singled her out so much so that trump inspired terrorists plotted to kidnap and murder her or in a pandemic that killed over 1 m people in the us he did n't bother to lead but he sure as heck took the time to divide us as a country
and this is what we should all be saying he has been an excellent president considering what he inherited and what he has been up against he is excellent at the job we are electing him to do
yeah i kinda wish we 'd all had that discussion a year ago instead of having a break glass in case of emergency scenario
in every poll i 've seen newsom is less popular than harris and that 's before being targeted by the gop with full blown oppo research including whatever his ex has on him
i think if they 're going to make that big of a change at this stage do it for the whole ticket not just vp biden could do a televised address and graciously announce that he 's going to let some younger but impressively experienced and proven leaders lead the charge going forward with his full support and introduce them right there hopefully one is named whitmer and for the other there are at least half a dozen democrats that could do it well
yeah more like week singular if they want it to happen
there ’s no time whitmer ca n’t possibly get enough national name recognition by then
the convention is 52 days away and the plan is to officially nominate biden before then time is very very short
the upside of getting 4 5 democratic candidates to give speeches discuss and debate nearly weekly for the next 18 weeks is that it would suck nearly all the air out of the room for the republicans it might ignite a huge amount of interest and focus from loads of folks because it 's so novel the media would be a bit giddy at 18 weeks of punditry and commentary and reportage as a bunch of democrats fight each other for the chance to be the presidential candidate it would end up making the convention a must see tv show because no one would have any idea what would happen in fact why not run this like the apprentice or the voice or agt get obama clinton and a mystery guest each week to review the speeches and discuss what they like and do n't like about the policy proposals and comment on style and delivery
you can tell by all the deflection from surrogates today that they are digging their heels in and ignoring what we all saw someone like whitmer needs to come out immediately and say he 's a good man but neither of these candidates are fit for office and they are going to provide an alternative option for the country
i just do n't think he will step down and the people around him will prop him up like a feinstein someone else jumping in and getting the support of the party might push him out though
he 'd have to come out and say the health issue occurred before the debate or else it would n't be believable but sure hell i suspect he did have a sudden and unforseen health issue in the weeks before the debate
to everyone yelling “ i’m still voting for biden ” fucking thank you it does n’t matter if the people who were going to vote for biden already are still voting for him he did n’t change swing voters ’ minds last night and that ’s literally all that matters so tired of people acting like since they ’re voting for him no matter what that things are still okay for biden ’s chances they ’re not
maybe gretchen whitmer could win with a colored man as vp if they can raise a lot of funds to get their names out in every blue and purple state people do n't vote for people they do n't know and gretchen is not known enough i think electing anyone that people do n't know will be too expensive they would have to spend like 12 hours a day in the public eye with ads running not only in the swing states but all blue states the upside is that michigan would be safe with gretchen maybe
i think you forget who the voters are sure everyone here on this reddit who would vote biden would vote for anyone on the ticket but there is a large amount of americans that are clueless and they would n't cast a vote on a name they never even heard of and newsom and gretch are both on that list right now but sure maybe there is time to get their names out there but also maybe not
in general biden was answering the question put before him before using his remaining time to try to fact check and respond to trump that was a mistake he should have stayed on topic to appear more focused and trusted the media to fact check trump afterwards
trump lied about all the numbers and biden could n’t remember them
i think you 're getting mixed up with trump who actively avoided answering any questions
to be fair i had the exact same expression on my face every time trump spoke
ha the flavor aid consumption is coming from the pearl clutchers this morning buddy besides i voted for biden and harris meaning if biden has to step down i ’m fine with president harris stepping up
i do n't know if this was true for everyone i watched live on cnn but nearly a full minute of biden 's closing remarks could not be heard i do n't know if the mic was off but when the audio finally kicked in nobody stopped him and asked him to start again they just let him go trump got his full time with mic on
heck yes he wo n't even be 90
if the democrats had given us anyone to vote for who was even within 10 years of the average age of a us citizen then this election would be a landslide victory for them but here we are telling ourselves “ there ’s no way that trump could win ” as we see it unfolding before our very eyes

jerry brown 's pretty old to be running for president though
he has a 38 % approval rating the only people who think he ’s been a great president on are this sub because it ’s simply not true
the polling will make the decision
she 's great but some of my neighbors legit want her lynched and killed our rednecks are bonkers
that ’s frankly not true all she has to do is step in and be not senile not a convicted felon not in her 80 ’s and a lot of undecided middle america will vote for her there ’s a sizable portion of trump supporters only backing him because they see biden as senile and a front trump ’s cult is the most outspoken but 50 % of the country is n’t all maga jan 6thers a lot simply just do nt believe a felon they ’ve already survived 4 years of is worse than a nursing home patient who has 4 more years to go
other countries run entire elections in a fraction of that time
in fact why not run this like the apprentice or the voice or agt the gop have been doing that since 2015 problem is they think agt is america 's got treason
yes but if whitmer does that she wo n't be the pick because that 's how the dnc operates
the surrogates are trying to calm the frenzy while the leadership decides what to do no dem with any political sense is going to call for biden to drop out until the leadership has decided how to replace him the problem with a he 's a good man but line is that it immediately brings up a lot of unwelcome questions like when did you realize biden was unfit for office and why did n't you do anything about it before now and if you 've only just realized he 's unfit how could you have not noticed before now the only way this works politically is if biden himself decides he 's had enough yeah people could go to him in private much as nixon was approached about resigning but public calls from dem politicians to drop out i do n't see that happening
no someone else publicly jumping in would get the undying enmity of the party
he did n’t change swing voters ’ minds last night he did he lost some of them
there really are no such things as swing voters at this point people know who they are going to vote for no debate or appearance is changing many people ’s minds 5 months is an eternity in politics by next week no one will be talking about this debate they would have moved on to something else it ’s pretty much dependent on who shows up or stays home to vote
this the people who are voting blue no matter who well it 's going to be a different who it 's the people who 'd be discouraged by the current choices that we need to get
with a colored man dude that 's not the preferred nomenclature
totally right nearly every biden response included a response to something trump had just said biden repeated the words the idea in nearly every answer he also talks really fast sometimes and important substance potential soundbites gets passed over too quickly i love joe but i think his debate coaches and communications team failed him
nah i 'd like biden to clarify what beating medicare means did he mean destroying the conversation around m4a
pretty much every dem that wants biden out knows that harris is a non starter they picked harris to make it harder to drop biden if they picked whitmer she might already be president by now as for flavoraid only one side is openly arguing for voting for a doomed candidate as the question of this campaign is n't will biden lose but how much will he lose by
if we had a competent president in 2020 we could have curbed inflation trump only cared about the short term which left us in a horrible position that had permanent consequences
it ’s really not compared to the rest of the world a lot of the economic problems is greed and failure to pay employees tell me why in my red state someone with two masters degrees and almost a phd i ’m getting paid less than 50k at my job yet when i move next year to a blue state my salary will almost triple for the same job
the economy is shit everywhere yes and the housing market is critical worldwide something must be done there and neither trump nor biden have a clear cut plan but the inflation is going down and the cost of living is improving from the last 2 years that 's why i said that the trend is getting better
during the height of covid we could n't even get toilet paper wonder whose fault that was
governor jerry brown has been president since 1984 according to jello biafra
whitmer newsom newsom at the top of the ticket would cost the midwest swing states
part of the problem is the media breathlessly following every move trump makes again instead of talking about biden 's accomplishments all of the major news channels are just trump trump trump from morning ' til night
i mean they probably want that of biden too
ballot access and fundraising she would have to start from scratch and all the ads already booked would have to be cancelled and the donations refunded
well i 'm saying she needs to do it to put pressure on him to drop out of the race and then there can be a brokered convention
that ’s flat out wrong there are enough swing voters to well swing the election
there are republicans who want a substitute for trump but became concerned after last night i do n’t think everyone is as concrete on their vote as media would like us to believe
then what is i meant not black only but any color i 'm not a native english speaker
a non starter but she is the vice president if the president is incapable of doing the do the next person in line does it that s kind of the rule maybe i ’m wrong but i think that ’s what happens and if no harris would speaker johnson have to hold it down til the democrats figured it out how long would that take and also just me being the cynical butthole here so if the democrat leadership has n’t been getting it right with biden up until now why would they get it right all of a sudden and pick whoever you want to pick i think biden did a bad debate performance and he ’s definitely not the best president but i think he ’s doing all right it ’s a debate that nobody won gretchen whitmer is correct and also being diplomatic here not only with biden but with us the general public also kind of “ steady on ” messaging

do we have proof of that or are we just going by whim i was expecting the debate to be bad but not that bad this was worse than nixon vs kennedy in my honest opinion look we have fascism to fight against we need to be trying more
the internet changed the game yes she ’d be way behind the 8 ball with advertising and everything but within a week everyone will have heard of her and watched a few videos and read a few articles from their favorite outlets telling them how to feel about her all people need to know is she ’s under 60 not senile not a socialist and most importantly not trump and that ’ll swing all the democrats and plenty of moderates biden would ’ve lost solely due being perceived as cognitively unfit to lead this election is different people are n’t voting for candidates rn their voting against what they perceive as worse form their bubbles dems see trump as a wannabe racist dictator anti christ with a project 2025 game plan to ruin america reps biden as a senile embodiment of everything they hate about the establishment and career politicians perpetuating a witch hunt against them and their messiah like leader moderates are having to pick again between a giant douche with a vendetta god complex and the policy equivalent of the anarchist cookbook and a turd sandwich that just plain is unappetizing got a small chance of straight up killing us and that everyone ’s gaslighting us into trying to believe is a soggy sloppy joe if someone walked by and said that some normal person around the corner running a food truck we ’d never heard of is selling a half asses blt we ’d jump at the opportunity and shout the good news to the world
ah i see i replied with a bit of a joke a reference to the big lebowski but colored people is generally not used anymore in north america where the names we use seem to change every generation or so people of color is ok now while colored people is not does it make any sense i do n't know but my reply was meant in jest not attacking you at all
donald trump is the correct answer
totally so if we want to replace biden of the names being mentioned whitmer should be at the top of the ticket of the limited polls that exist she does far better than newsom in swing states
oh i see when i think about it i think i kinda knew that colored people is not totally okay i just did n't know what to use instead maybe gretchen whitmer could win with a man of color as vp if they can raise a lot of funds to get their names out in every blue and purple state is this more correct xd

congress does n't even write the bills scotus just handed legislative responsibility to corporate lobbyists
unless we get a super majority for more than a month no real regulations will be passed to actually help us with current republicans
this was the crown jewel of the 2016 election we are watching an activist court powered by right wing dark money ripping up the post new deal version of america one step at a time this decision will be the basis for a torrent of lawsuits challenging everything from the department of education to the epa and as long as republicans control 41 senate seats they can stop laws from being enacted that re establish these departments authority even if dems get supermajorities the courts can just deem something unconstitutional on whatever legal basis they need to concoct what an absolute embarrassment for our country that john roberts has led this court on a power trip “ but her fucking emails ” edit senate seat math
since this scotus decision threw precedent out the window then it should be pretty easy for a future scotus to reverse this and re establish the previous standard
and they ’ll still blame the president for congress ’ impotence
how apropos that right before independence day we officially became an oligarchy
a trump 47 would just ignore the court and order the executive agencies do what he wanted and the courts would let him
every future president if trump gets re elected they will find a way to give them everything they want
sadly a corrupt do nothing congress the type of people in the putinjrtrump republican cult since wwii has not done anything except destroy offer no solutions the reasons for our illegitimate maga supreme court
so what happened to the talk of expanding the court or rotating out justices after a period of time
congress will do two things jack and shit and jack left town
this is good more responsibility needs to lie with democratically elected officials than unelected and nameless bureaucrats
wow congress actually has to write statute in a way that people can understand what a disaster
the united states government is literally like 5 corporations in a trench coat
that ’s the plan always has been
not what he wants what the koch cabal wants
they just threw out his bump stock order with the atf using chevron as justification
well all of it will have to be challenged in court and the courts will let it be implemented while it ’s decided and so it ’ll just happen
expanding the number of justices on the court is a theoretical possibility but the constitution makes it clear that supreme court justices serve lifetime appointments the only way to change that would be through a constitutional amendment
it ’s wishcasting wo n’t happen and is a bad idea the way people get hung up on these things as panaceas for the democrats ’ repeated political malpractice is immensely frustrating absent hrc ’s terrible 2016 campaign and rbg ’s hubris the world would be different the solution is n’t structural it ’s political do better
thanks for a rational take the executive branch was never supposed to unilaterally make policy through agencies that ’s congress ’ job and they ’ve been ass at it
those elected officials have the ability to rescind whatever authority they originally granted as easily as they gave it the whole point of making the authority broad in the first place was specially to not have to continuously waste time relegislating every minor change
the problem with that is that the ' democratically elected officials ' may have no idea what they 're doing so they 're gon na have to consult the ' unelected and nameless bureaucrats ' anyway if they want to be effective at their job however as is often the case with republicans they have no desire to be effective at their job and they control a great deal of state legislatures
yes i 'm a judge my name is uh vincent vincent justiceman i have to go do a court
that 's a good way to put it
the full court can rule on the small number of cases for which the scotus has original jurisdiction congress can expand the court with a regular cycle of appointments say every 2 years and define the appellate jurisdiction as cases to settled by the 9 most recently appointed justices
right but no one said that the appointment has to be active they ’re appointed but services only required on a rotating basis every few years as we roll through the 40 some odd justices each term
good they should consult with the bureaucrats before making decisions that would be a sign of a properly functioning democratic republic forcing important decisions to go through congress helps promote visibility and better ensures that actions being taken are in line with the will of the people
it should n’t be especially if you claim to be on the side of protecting democracy like many on this sub do
you clearly do n't understand how corruption works it will not be ' taken in line with the will of the people ' it will be taken in line with big corporations who 's desires usually arn't in line with the will of the people honestly i have more faith in faceless bureaucrats than i do in elected officials which says something about this country honestly
they know they just do n’t care for some reason they are just happy to own the libs
implying that congress is corrupt which i agree with but not bureaucratic officials at the same time is quite a take look into the backgrounds of some of these high ranking officials and you might quickly start to lose faith with congress at least there ’s a mechanism to hold them accountable voting them out of office our whole government is littered with corruption at i have a semblance of influence over the people that are elected
the bureaucrats have much more strict ethics rules than congress firing them for being lazy is difficult firing civil servants for corruption is actually very easy an “ appearance of impropriety ” is sufficient for disciplinary action the ig does n’t have to prove corrupt action just that it looks corrupt and that violates the terms of employment this is also why the former guy fired so many inspectors general they keep catching his corrupt buddies
they should have been changed with sedition and been done with
this ruling will either backfire or be used to protect future insurrectionist
it ’s a good decision tbh i do n’t think people lives should be ruined for protesting the government
jan 6th went way past a protest
it is nowhere near an insurrection though
what about the blm riots the hypocrisy is kind of crazy when one captured the intent of protest to be directed towards the government and the other killed more people and destroyed small businesses mostly owned by minorities and immigrants
it was definitely attempted insurrection if it was n't insurrection it is only because they did not succeed
when did black lives matter storm govt buildings is it the false equivalency that ’s crazy for you there are better civil rights related riots to pick from not very interesting trolling
the difference is that j6 was an insurrection because it was a directed attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power mike pence was a target because he was going to certify the results of the election i ’m not debating if the blm protests were good or not but definitely not comparable to what happened on january 6th because of intent
25 people died from the riots and over 2 billion dollars worth of property damage property owned by small business owners only terminally online people ca n’t see the hypocrisy here
yes those are riots ones that where targeting the absolute shit show that is police accountability in america asking broadly for change not trageting any one preaon or system of government january 6th however was a politically motivated attack on on the seat of our government with the express goal of overturning our democratic elections for the goal of installing a person into power that did not win the popular vote or an electoral college victory that is the difference one was a run of the mill protest that got out of hand turning into a riot the other was a impromptu attack on or democratically elected republic that is why january 6th is a insurrection and not just a riot
my package has been stuck in a loop in virginia for a month and they want me to pay 30 for a package intercept i called every local post office in the area and no one has ever answered the phone i went in person and they told me i had to sign up for package intercept online i contacted usps support and could never talk to a real person the system is really bad
i ’ve heard dejoy has more power than scotus
well at least a tiny bit of good news out of the court today
lol it feels good knowing that i do n't have to go to prison in three days while bannon does what a loser
lock him up but give him a bath first
well even a broken clock is right twice a day
i feel like i 'm in the wash cycle with these ups and downs of the supreme court
if there was actual justice that piece of shit would get sodomized in jail low life piece of shit
yup with the debate anger at supreme court decisions and the u s losing to panama at the copa america been a rough 24 hours for the united states i assume most people do n't care about u s soccer but that upset me personally and was a failing for the nation
get an inch and lose a mile type of win but i 'm desperate and will take it who has the champagne
yes a tiny bit no expectations now not much hope either
just a general delousing decent chance there wo n’t be anything left afterwards
removing his protective layer of slime may seriously disrupt his body ’s internal functions
i care about the usmnt and while a part of me is frustrated when they drop a game like that another part of me keeps hoping that maybe soccer house will get off their pompous asses and finally get serious about the men 's game but i 'm sure the folks in soccer house still think they shit marble
i have a bottle of prosecco that i ’ve been saving for a special occasion it ’s looking like this is as special as it ’s going to get when will you be over
i bet he ’s most worried about not being able to drink alcohol while he ’s locked up
haha if we do n't advance i think he will be fired
was going to say 5 30 but it 's been a rough week and i 'll dip out a little early let 's say 4 45
he ’ll lose weight and will have to buy smaller button downs to layer on top of each other nothing to be done about the gin blossom skin cancer complexion though
he will never be fired us soccer answers to nobody and us soccer media are pathetic
what about the four pens why does anyone carry four pens clipped to their shirt inquiring minds want to know
not unlike some other american institutions i can think of
i 've had a crunch wrap more supreme than this court
based on recent rulings i have very low expectations here
ah yes the blatantly corrupt scandal ridden judges he appointed will determine if he did anything wrong our political system is fundamentally broken at this point and there 's zero hope
i ’m gon na venture out here and say they ’re gon na come up with some convoluted restricted immunity blah blah blah the only remedy is to expand the supreme court to 13 it has been done before it can be done again
all americans of good conscience must hit the streets monday if trump is granted immunity
considering the rulings that have come out over the past 7 days at this point i pretty much expect them to say he has full immunity and can not be prosecuted for any crimes committed while in office 6 to 3
i 'll believe that when it happens
at least bannon has to report to prison
if these guys keep going the way they have been then we wo n’t have need for a scotus i “ think ” they believe they will be like dr crane in the dark knight rises they can give us death or exile us over a frozen river seems on point these days lol
one would expect them to delay more but with how today went maybe they just go ” yes this man can have unfettered power with no consequences ”
what will dems do if the court agrees with immunity
surely they ’ll say he has immunity if he ’s doing official presidential duties and no immunity for anything else including crimes committed in pursuit of winning an election
so biden would be able to order the conservative justices be assassinated and not be held accountable for it
if the supreme court rules in trump 's favor biden will be armed at the next debate
nail him for treason and espionage then
great who ’s excited to see true democracy slip away into oblivion come monday
we know where this is going we have to stop lying to ourselves about this
i predict 6 3 presidents can do whatever the fuck they want but only if they are orange
if the supreme court can find a way to rule so that it only benefits trump it will
the same people complaining about the supreme court are also the voters who will elect a president who has stated repeatedly he has no intentions of fixing the problem congratulations you made your bed
now that trump ’s 2nd term is basically a done deal our corrupt conservative scotus will show fealty by granting immunity to their orange god king
if the supreme court is truly supreme where 's the guac ground beef and sour cream weird al
the supreme court fucked us all if we were smart we should stop listening to the supreme court fuckheads
it cost more than their integrity too
the supreme court is clearly corrupt how long before they overturn gay marriage and interracial marriage it can happen they will also ban conspetives very soon i feel this country is going to shit beacuse of a blantly courrupt court
no no they 're determining if it 's possible for him to do anything wrong
it ’s going to take years of organizing and consistent democratic control to reset the court and enact legislation to restore balance to our democracy all it takes is one republican president and the current aging justices will likely resign to b replaced by ones that will decide our rights for the rest of our lives fuck this system and fuck th dnc for allowing this rbg should ’ve resigned obama ’s appointees should n’t have been stalled be the dnc needs to buckle the fuck up and stop treating the gop like they are acting with any semblance of good faith
if you think about it seriously what is the problem with expanding the supreme court everyone says “ well if you do that then the other party will just add twice as many people when it ’s their turn ” that ’s fine because then we just turned around and do it ourselves and round and round we go there ’s nothing wrong with having a humongous supreme court because it just evens the opinions out even better instead of vesting the power into just nine unelected people
agreed something like from this point forward but not retroactively presidents wo n't have immunity
packing the court is only really a solution as a bargaining move to force real reform otherwise you 've just created the situation where anytime a party holds the presidency and senate they just expand it far enough to give themselves a majority
biden will call his goon squad on monday if the sc says presidents have full immunity
what about the ones after office and before hosting a riot to take out political rivals while president cool then let ’s make it an executive order to make it super official and go through the paperwork
and the current president can take “ extreme action ” to free up some supreme court seats same for anyone else who stands in the way no consequences so why not
if you hand me full immunity in a seat of power and there were only a handful of people threatening democracy for the other 370 million ish then i ’d say it would be my duty to use the full might and force of my position to handle it by any means necessary i mean assuming i swore an oath and allegiance to a constitution and not a billionaire or a political party
think they just said it 's not obstructing as long as you do n't touch any documents or something lol jan 6th insurrectionists
my man it ’s a shame what madonna did to him
and then biden is king
anyone who thought that obergfell was safe should no longer feel that way undoing decades of progress
it 's gon na end up being the same thing either way lol
i m not sure that ’s a bad thing we can dilute its power that way it becomes less political if the court grows eventually justices wo n’t feel the need to stay on the court until they ’re genriatric we have 9 people making these enormous decisions and deciding what rights we 370 million people have it ’s asinine blow up the court make it less political
it needs to be tied to the number of appellate courts when it was set to nine it was one judge to oversee each appellate court they 've since increased to thirteen so some justices have to oversee multiple if they wanted to increase it past that then that would involve creating more courts something that is too much of a headache just to increase sc seats
not presidents that president that being said they 'll throw this back to the lower courts to argue about official actions all about delaying
no matter what some people think the supreme court justices are not complete idiots they would be well aware that grant any all presidents immunity would effectively end any semblance of republican control given that biden is currently in office if trump is granted immunity it will most certainly be a limited immunity of some sort and likely a one time thing that only applies to him specifically one thing i could see them doing is throwing it back to the lower courts on a stupid technicality to drag things out even longer considering that granting him immunity is not really practical if they want to help trump delaying things even further is somethin well within their capabilities
except we all know they 'll somehow only grant trump immunity or exclude biden from it
ny does n't have to abide by the ruling during trump 's sentencing so there is at least that they can easily claim the crime happened before he was president so no immunity attached and the law had nothing to do with presidential authority plus who in the federal government is going to send someone to ny to break him out of prison should he be put there
you kidding he ’s even cooler as a zombie
i feel if obergfell gets overturned it 's gon na piss everyone off and be a fatal blow to republicans it would increase turn out and give democrates more ammo against republicans because it will force republicans to choose lgbt rights or not
oh it 's much much much much worse if they decide a president ca n't break the law like we 're all going to camps and nothing you can do to prevent it bad like reichstag fire bad like global disaster bad if they were just being asked if donald trump was at fault there 'd still be a world where the next more competent fascist could be held back if they accept any version of the immunity claim then they just rubber stamped the world 's most highly armed democracy into an autocratic joke
i 'm not sure you really understood what i said imagine the democrats expand it to 13 but then the republicans in the future get the house and senate so they expand it to 17 to get the majority back then eventually when democrats have the house and senate they just immediately expand it to 20 or 21 or 25 or whatever is necessary to have a comfortable majority but then the next time the republicans are in power etc etc etc a precedent where whichever party is in power can just expand and pack the court at will makes the court completely and totally political because it 's a guarantee that every single time the presidency senate change party they can expand and pack the court so it will rubber stamp whatever they want it would be a ridiculously situation packing the court makes it so dramatically more political the only use sensible use for packing the court would be as part of some bargaining threat or temporary move as part of actual dramatic reform to find a more sensible way of running the court
they will rule on it after the election if biden wins the president will not have immunity if trump point he will have immunity
more like immunity would have to be determined on a case by case basis why that ca n't then be done during the pre trial part of the case where the defense would make their case why the president could do what they did under their official capacity as president is unclear but it 'll be up to congress or a corny court to decide not those pesky state or local courts or low level federal judges who may not know any better
they do n’t care they ’ll do it anyways
no that ’s exactly what i thought you meant and it ’s exactly what i want continuously expanding the court eventually leads ti that strategy ceasing to work effectively every seat you add dilutes the power of all the others make the court 200 seats i do n’t care that ’s kinda my point we can get judges rotating more judges who may be closer to the electorate that way so we do n’t have thomas ’ and rbgs staying on for ever the more judges there are the less each one leaving becomes problematic sure a party could expand the court every term but eventually it becomes a losing proposition because the number of seats you ’d have to add would get bigger and bigger and dilute each seat more and more the more a seat is diluted the more likely judges are to leave which opens up seats for the current administration i ’m not saying it ’s perfect but i think a bigger court is far better than what we have now the court should ’ve grown with the country ’s population we should correct that
maybe there should be 25 and 9 or 13 hear a case picked at random they rotate so no one ever knows who will hear a case and the 25 as a group decide if someone should be recused just spitballing here anyone else
agreed i think the court should be expanding by 1 justice for every day during a presidency if biden wins there would be no way for the nazi party to pack the court more than that during their reign at this point the court should either be dissolved or filled so much the nazis do n't hold a majority
that would require an amendment but yea i ’d be cool with that i think slowly expanding the court to 25 is reasonable probably not achievable but reasonable we could even space them out so it ’s one or two new justices per year or two that way every side has an opportunity to wi elections and get someone on it ’s less of a stacking that way we need legitimate courts it ’s a critics component of a function democracy we ’re beginning to lose that it makes me very very worried for my kids futures
big win for the lobbyists there ’s literally no way of stopping them now from buying our government
“ we know less than diddlysquat about the real world but we feel like we know everything so just leave the important medical climate and environmental decisions to us ” the supreme idiot six
the court knows that the us is too divided to elect a united congress that can actually pass meaningful regulations they should n't have to anyway because they do n't have the expertise but who cares when one party is ran by literal cartoon villains
conservative majority rules yet again for the rightwing agenda cuz of course they did
this is the most consequential and insane decision this court has ever done or will ever do and they 've done some real whoppers
the unelected conservative supermajority strikes again insane that we have vested such power in such a corrupt group of ideological warriors fuck the gop
just wait until something goes to trial and the jury sides with the little guy and big business get a worse decision than what an administrative judge would have ruled
i m thinking of train derailings surprime mortgage crash unregulated ai etc
a reminder why we must vote democratic in november despite what we saw last night
wow that 's honestly really sad to hear i was already less than thrilled due to that clusterfuck of a debate but this one really hurts yet another way conservatives are steam rolling their decisions through whether people like it or not this is going to have extremely far reaching effects across pretty much everything
we are watching the dismantling of our democracy in real time and that ’s not an exaggeration
i ’d like for acb to explain what she meant by “ super precedent ” because she and others do n’t seem to care much for it these days
as an outsider i do n't get this i keep hearing about how the regulatory agencies are captured by the industries they want to regulate and are worthless if you 're a conservative why would you want to mess that up keep getting your interpretation of the law rubberstamped by weak regulators rather than taking your chances in the courts where there 's a decent chance you 'll run into an independent judge i keep thinking about the sec in particular and how much the capital markets have invested in the sec 's rulemaking why would you want to upset that or is this just about the epa
how do we even come back from this
a republic for corporate rule bravo america bravo
eradicating conservative power is essential to the future of humanity
how low does the supreme court have to go before biden grows a fucking pair and expands the court
good now agencies like the atf can no longer switch up their determination on how they interpret statute definitions from one administration to another the days are gone of something being fine and legal one day to being deemed illegal simply because their administration has changed and circumventing congress for their laws
can you elaborate cus i had this hunch too
they bought it decades ago bro
“ we ca n’t rely on federal judges to decide these things because they ’re unelected ” say unelected bureaucrats
this ruling leaves less room for a potential trump administration to use their own interpretation of the regulations is that a bad thing
i mean that 's what they are paid to do so
or will ever do is basically asking for them to grant absolute presidential immunity on monday
probably the biggest since plessy v ferguson and that 's one of the worst decisions in the court 's history
and then it gets kicked up to this supreme court and they overturn it because they 're corrupt as fuck
that ’s an interesting silver lining i had n’t considered probably too niche to be helpful but get a few huge jury decided judgements and it at least keeps this ridiculous ruling in the conversation for years until wiser heads prevail
it puts everything to a jury trial which will overwhelm the courts on top of that the rightwingers on the court just legalized corporate bribery yesterday local agencies will likely be compromised those communities supporting the polluters will take it on the chin same with consumers of highly processed foods and goods tbh though pollution and warming are interstate and even global problems the american lifespan has been shortening recently and that will probably hasten
when boeing is ahead of the curve
voting wo n't get us out of this decision that s how fucked we are
if you look at the russian model of oligarchy and extreme corruption it makes sense the fewer bodies that can exercise power the more power can centralize the easier it is to pull strings that also allows a fuckton of foreign influences in to the operation of the us through corporate middleman entities and fewer government bodies to worm their way into to get that regulatory capture they 're after the fundamental aim is more dramatic and extreme wealth extraction with fewer restrictions to fewer people who are prooooobably not actually gon na be based in the usa except for owning a shitton of things and extracting a shitton of wealth from it
this has zilch to do with guts and everything to do with political reality president biden ca n’t “ expand the court ” without enough votes in congress to pass the necessary legislation those votes are simply not there with a republican controlled u s house sharply divided senate in which there are n’t even close to 60 votes needed to break an inevitable gop filibuster so many comments attacking the president for not performing an impossible task single handedly canceling student loan debt unilaterally “ codifying ” roe v wade and or forcing recalcitrant pseudo democrats like manchin and sinema to vote for build back better indicate stupefying ignorance of how our political system actually functions a disingenuous cheap shot intended to mislead readers or an asinine mixture of both
yep enjoy having toxic waste in your water because the epa can no longer do its job
it goes way beyond single issues this ruling will strip away protections for clean air and water it will strip away safety standards for workers regulations keeping companies and banks from screwing you will be reverted it 's going to get rough out there there 's so much more going on in this world than atf 's brace rule bullshit besides the government will find ways to keep the atf going even trump was take the guns due process later
dude i love guns and i hate having to jump through hoops for nfa items like sbrs and suppressors but to act as if this is going to be good for the country is so incredibly short sighted this is going to fuck things over in so so many ways mostly for the environment also do you really think this is going to change things for the atf they 'll still come and shoot your dog
yeah it also means that there will no longer be a requirement for the fda to exist since it can not accurately determine proper means to test drugs that is n’t outlined by congress or the faa can no longer function because congress has not regulated the air space can no longer prevent drones from flying into airports because they can not regulate airspace i ca n’t wait s
circumventing congress for their laws chevron never removed any power from congress they always had the ability codified laws that reinforced or overturned agency rules
basically congress now has to write specific laws for any kind of regulation our current legislative branch is at a historical gridlock with almost nothing getting passed lobbyists and corporations can easily bribe lawmakers to pass laws that will allow them to maximize profit without any restrictions made by experts in the specific field and if nothing gets passed there ’s nothing from stopping the corporations regardless any type of federal agency is now fucked
“ just trust us ” sayeth the six who failed high school chemistry
congress determined what power the bureaucrats should have
bureaucrats you mean scientists subject matter experts public health practitioners policy advisors i e people extremely knowledgeable of their professional niches you know the people that keep you breathing clean air drinking clean water eating safe food and driving a safe car on a safe road to your safe work building where you exist in blissful ignorance of how well you ’re cared for
when they do n’t know the difference between laughing gas and pollution yes it ’s a bad idea to leave the “ interpretation ” up to the supreme idiot six
if we had an impartial and independent judiciary that would be true we do not we have a supreme court that intentionally decided to hear a case that former u s presidents are immune from prosecution in defiance of literally a quarter of a millennia of precedent just to delay the prosecution of a man who was accused of stealing national security documents and lying about having them to assist his re election the judiciary is just as partisan as congress what trump wants the supreme court is going to give him when he is re elected the rules restrain the enemies of conservativism they do not restrain conservativism itself
i mean some are quintessentially embodiments of the devil
same i vote but it does n't even matter when half the country is certifiably insane and wants to see everything burn to ashes
sure whatever just another whopper today they dropped a nuke on the entire regulatory apparatus of the government
lol i did actually mean just the roberts court but yeah its an all timer
maybe not but if we let another gop president appoint the next couple of justices these decisions are all we will get
i do n't disagree with any of that i guess it just felt to me like they 'd already achieved those goals with the existing model that feels like the model for seizing a country that 's not already playing byyour rules when the regulator is already giving you everything you want why fuck with it
that 's not what 's going to happen relax
also anything new is the wild west i assume oh the specific law had this exact chemical composition but this one has water too guess its good
if you ca n't get your legislative body to enact the laws you want then you 're just fucked you can not try to balance a three legged stool on two legs and blame the two legs when it falls over
pretty much and sadly we stuck with them
and when nine people are given the authority to pull this shit
same reason every service manufacturer and app developer gets shittier even if they 've monopolized the market and have total domination got ta boost the profits why settle for lots when you can kill some people and have even more
it actually is exactly what this ruling allows and based on your example exactly what you want to happen
why not it 's cheaper and there is no regulating body to prevent it corporations can and will do whatever they can to make more profit
that ’s exactly what ’s going to happen
that 's not what 's going to happen relax lmao it literally has happened before
yup find out chemical food additive x causes hella cancer in five years if congress got around to banning it just tweak the additive a bit and the ban can go fuck itself and people can continue getting cancer freedom
the supreme court decides if a law passed by congress is constitutional they win
for those that pay attention to stuff like this feel like farmers markets and locally sourced grocers are gon na see a boom in customers i ’m seriously concerned to eat anything processed now the simply juice company got sued for having forever chemicals in their juices last year guess they get to put those back now god now i ’m thinking of growing my own grain for flour scotus is making me become crunchy but the water
chevron never affected constitutional law there was no chevron constitutional deference
irrelevant to my point the supreme court has authority over the laws congress passes even if you get the law you want 9 people in dresses can decide by fiat that it does not go into effect
so then you 're not debating chevron you 're just airing general grievances about scotus and constitutional law those are valid but not relevant to chevron
gutting chevron changes the system from trusting the subject matter experts of a given administration elected by the people every four years implementing laws passed by congress to the courts now decisions are going to be made by nine unelected non policy experts without an understanding of the nuances required to operate in a complex modern world chevron replaces scientists and experts with deep specific field experience with 9 unelected justices with no skin in the game and lifetime appointments and zero accountability as long as 33 % of the senate is held by a political party that finds them useful so yeah this is bad we will now have supreme court justices claiming for themself the decision making power about how much lead in public drinking water is allowed and not actual medical researchers and scientists who actually know something about the subject matter and if congress says it should be 1ppm but the court rules in favor of a plaintiff who says it should be 100ppm on whatever constitutes originialist legal theory is useful that day congress loses this is an exponential power grab by the judicial branch
so you think rbg was wrong in the chevron case
that thing we said we would do we did n't so it 's really your fault fuck cnn
so the new owner of cnn who ’s happen to be a trump supporter says this that makes sense because we know who ’s he rooting for and against
cnn is so full of shit i ca n't believe it i ca n't believe how they framed the abortion question against biden focusing strictly on late term abortions biden was a disaster but you ca n't convince me that cnn does n't want trump
i wo n't talk specifically about how it went last night but let me speak generally the format of allowing 2 minutes to answer with up to 3 back and forths is just not enough time to fact check and get your point across let 's say every 30 seconds someone tells a lie that means that 4 lies could be told in that two minutes you then only have 60 seconds to try to rebut maybe two if you 're lucky i 'm not saying the format was the reason biden lost the debate but if cnn was not going to fact check they should have allowed much more time for discussion
it would make sense if the other candidate was n't lying with every word biden seemly tried to fact check trump and answer the question before getting lost in his own thoughts because there was just too much bullshit with wade through for someone old as dirt edit people were asking why biden looked shook when trump was speaking did ya'll not hear the shit he was saying anyone would have been confused at the pure crap he said much less an 80 year old
this is such horse crap they would just cut them off if they tried cnn is a failure
cnn is illustrating how a “ debate”where the moderators reject the basic responsibility of fact checking in real time and refuse to challenge blatantly false statements is not a debate it ’s a chaos where lies are given equal footing with the truth
if they fact checked trump they would never get past the first question
fact checking donald trump is a lost cause it ’s an absolutely impossible task
text the%20gish%20gallop%20 % 2f%cb%88%c9%a1 or%20strength%20of%20those%20arguments during a gish gallop a debater confronts an opponent with a rapid series of specious arguments half truths misrepresentations and outright lies in a short space of time which makes it impossible for the opponent to refute all of them within the format of a formal debate each point raised by the gish galloper takes considerably more time to refute or fact check than it did to state in the first place which is known online as brandolini 's law the technique wastes an opponent 's time and may cast doubt on the opponent 's debating ability for an audience unfamiliar with the technique especially if no independent fact checking is involved or if the audience has limited knowledge of the topics
cnn we provide support for lies and it 's your fault if you trust us for real facts
then there is no point in them hosting a debate
high school debates follow this basic rule fuck cnn
when trump is saying that a doctor has the lawful right to murder a baby after the birth in some states the cnn moderator needs to fucking grow a pair of balls and call that shit out for the disgusting lie that it is it was extremely disappointing to see that one slide
cnn could have just posted fact checks as graphics after all it 's not nice when any public figure lies to you they all deserve accountability to the truth
then it just leads to both candidates calling each other liars moderators need to call out obvious lies
just about every media resource is playing right into trump ’s hand it ’s ridiculous
that gives an advantage to the one lying it leaves the other one to answer the questions and clean up the liar 's mess no one can effectively do that in the time allotted
any question trump did n’t want to answer he just started spewing a bunch of nonsense garbage and attacking anything then the “ moderators ” said “ thank you ” and just moved on any real journalist with a spine would have kept pressing for an answer to the actual question cnn is a joke
so you really can just replace moderators with a teleprompter and two shock collars
what happened to journalistic integrity
why do we even need moderators then if a candidate is nt going to even answer questions and lie constantly with any pushback it ’s not a debate just maga greatest hits in prime time
i think we need to elect a formal debate commission that operates under a standardized procedure including criteria for eligibility to debate one being convicted felons are ineligible i ’m done with cable news setting up debates
what is the point of having moderators if you 're not going to keep the debate on topic or fact check anything you might as well just have an audience asking questions
it ’s not our job to do our job
uh what the fuck no it 's not otherwise we would n't have got obama 's please proceed moment followed up by fact checkers correcting romney
people are blaming cnn but they 're missing the fact that trump absolutely would not attend any debates where the moderators pushed back on him or where fact checking would be done in real time how do we know because trump outright said he would not attend the bipartisan presidential debate commission scheduled debates the only format trump would agree to was one where he could spew his bullshit and lies unchecked and unchallenged
failed “ news ” network such a shocking response
to be fair a nothing stopped biden from challenging trump ’s falsehoods he repeats the same ones every time so biden should have had rebuttals prepped and b they did go through fact checking after the debate to be honest i think it would have been far more distracting and worse to have what the moderators checking every little fact that ’s not their job their job is to ask questions and keep the debate moving along
one of the most frustrating things i ’ve watched in a long time
cnn is in the business of selling an election
yeah it ’s only our entire democracy at stake project 2025 will devastate america
cnn sucks ass it ’s owned by a crazy right wing nut total bullshit that they let that moron trump stand up there and fucking lie his ass off trump is the worst president to ever hold office in america felon criminal racist rapist why is it even possible for felon to run for president
i have watched cnn since it was created never again fuck cnn i do n’t want the candidates for the highest office in the world to be allowed to lie and not be called out
so in other words no fact checking
fuck trump and fuck cnn
in normal circumstances i 'd agree that 's sort of the point of a debate present arguments and defend them the problem here is trump does n't do that he just makes up easily disproven bullshit and doubles down on it time after time it 's not even a debate he has no real policy and even if he did he 's completely incapable of defending them because he does n't know the first fucking thing about any of it
cnn is try repairing its image
this is why the media sucks it 's literally their job to cut through the bullshit and and tell people when the politicians are lying otherwise we just have he said they said choose your own adventure based on vibes
hope cnn gets cancelled they let americans down last night
i was a cnn watcher middle america no longer has a news choice this was a load of donkey shot trump spun a load the entire debate and did n’t answer questions americans needed to hear
ah yes barf out 50 % of your content as lies for 2 minutes and then give that person 1 minute to fact check in real time do n't worry cnn other news outlets are fact checking for you just not in real time cable network news indeed
if fact checking was in the contract they should sue
how do the defend allowing one candidate to ignore the posed question over and over to rant about migrants on every answer breaking the debate rules to answer the posed questions and topic is that not their job to enforce the rules
they did n't want to make orange jesus look bad on live air it 's on purpose
i know you ’re reading this cnn you can fuck right off with that sentiment
except everyone knew that trump was just going to be a firehose of shit i was flabbergasted when he started talking about full term babies being delivered and then murdered and no one raised a single objection
well cnn has certainly disqualified itself from doing this again
i would have liked a live fact checker but i would have settled for a 30 minute end of the show fact check run the debate have the people talking at the end and then do a summary section with the facts checked but no they had it on their website that no one is going to look at
no it actually is n’t especially if you also started a rule where the mics get turned off plus fact checking should ’ve never been a negotiated thing it should be the norm for every debate until the end of time
bullshit with two minutes to answer do you watch your time fact checking a liar or try to answer the question cnn said they would fact but bailed giving trump a win they like the clicks
it was a horrible debate i am not an american yet i feel sorry for the americans while aggressive criticism will definetly exist in politics it was nothing but insults and verbal attacks biden seemed like a walking corpse and did n't manage to debate properly trump kept avoiding the questions and mentioning immigration all the time even though most issues did n't have anything to do with it just terrible my condolences to the americans
let ’s be honest here if you think cnn should have fact checked the debate live then what would you say when inevitably one side or both sides scream about bias true facts are facts but i ca n’t imagine trump ’s supporters and trump himself being ok with cnn saying he was lying no the job of cnn was to host the debate and provide the moderators which they did and the moderators were quite fair giving both candidates opportunities to address questions more than once reminding them of the time they had left allowing some extra 1 minute responses etc it was up to the candidates to address each other ’s falsehoods not cnn
i mean they 're not wrong this is the most unbiased debate moderation i 've ever seen biden tried his hand at debunking but did n't have the wherewithal to pull it off
honestly agree with cnn on this debates would be pretty tedious if the moderator butted in every sentence with a well actually comment we 'd never get anywhere and it turns the moderator into a debater it 's supposed to be about the candidates and their abilities not arguments with the moderator people should be checking facts themselves anyway
i agree with cnn here it ’s up to biden to fact check every lie trump would fact check biden on everything but biden did n’t do that nearly as much as he should have not on the moderators this debate did its job it showed the country and the world the state of both candidates and they both have very serious yet very different issues going on one lies a lot and the other one is very old decaying
what i ca n’t understand is why biden was n’t better prepared to rebut trumps lies with facts data quotes studies policy court cases etc it ’s not as if there was no prediction what lies he would tell about a certain topic he has been parroting the same ones for 3 years and refuting them is easy with one or two talking points trumps lies are predictable as he spouts them in every interview speech rally fundraiser etc this should have been a slam dunk for biden
fact checking lol biden needs a gibberish translator he can barely communicate
they ask questions and the candidates debate that ’s what it should be you guys are blaming cnn for biden being a shitty candidate who ca n’t debate
cnn is shit but they 're not wrong on this one it 's the debaters job to provide pushback for each other and unfortunately that plays in donald 's favor cause he can tell more lies in his response time than you can clean up in your rebuttal time
i agree it was biden ’s job i have zero issues complaining about cnn 364 days of the year but it ’s biden ’s job to fact check trump and he did n’t
nobody came to defend joe from trump and he could not defend himself we can do better please joe call it a day before you go on to lose to the most ridiculous candidate ever the sooner joe passes the baton the better chance we have
biden should use stronger words than malarkey anybody who understands malarkey is at least 75 years old
i 'm sorry but they are n't wrong i get their angle is money driven but someone spewing easily disprovable lies is what 's k own in the debate world as free fucking lunch absolutely sad that biden could n't handle the literal softball that is donald trump tossed his way anyone else would be kicking this shit goblin into oblivion
they 're absolutely right if biden did n't act like a fucking mummy up there this woulda been a layup
well trump never lied he used hyperbole in certain situations as he always does please feel free to show me where he lied i will wait
hosts a debate featuring trump the world ’s most prolific pathological liar and decides not to fact check i do n’t think that was a coincidence i concur fuck cnn
what a fucking cop out by cnn i ’m really starting to h8 them
plus it does n't make any sense to have a trump opponent do it it takes more time to refute a lie than it does to tell one it is a mathematical impossibility to refute them all if the other candidate is up there rolling off lie after lie the whole time it would monopolize biden 's entire speaking time and he could never speak for himself
maybe biden should have done that instead of talking about his golf
yeah blame cnn for showing us who biden really is everyone is tired of the bullshit lies replace him with someone competent
imagine fact checking biden ’s lies
exactly ever since he took over cnn has become fox lite
i 'm sure they do just for the money they would make if he gets another term
and in this case 4 lies in 2 minutes was the minimum he was spewing
exactly plus biden ca n't open up google in the middle of the debate and fact check it
do n't forget about the bullshit asymmetry principle bullshitting is easy but refuting bullshit is hard
plus the opponent can introduce new lies in each back and forth
yes because it was intentional cnn is owned by a right wing billionaire whom asll billionaires would benefit from a trump presidency our country is a corporatocracy the wealthiest own the politicians and this is how they do it
not true watch the debate in colorado that ’s how a debate is supposed to be moderated and fact checked
yeah go after even a majority of trump 's lies and he 'd have had no time to articulate anything of his own instead we 'd have headlines like biden fails to articulate his platform mention achievements spends whole debate attacking trump
this is called “ the gish gallop ” google it we witnessed a “ master class ” by the orange idiot on how to steamroll a debate format
i do n’t think the moderator has to do that as someone who watches a lot of debates it is usually up to the debaters to call each other out on lies and poor arguments moderators are more for keeping the answers on topic and making sure the agreed upon format is being followed now there can be fact checking but maybe we need some sort of ai integration that is impartial and both candidates are fact checked equally and given chances to correct honest mistakes and be called out on deliberate lies
ok just hear me out look at the moderator performance of chris wallace in 2020 the mofo from frickin fauxnews and compare him with that ai chatbot with a timer jake tapper from cnn chris from fauxnews did a far better job at keeping trump ’s more outrageous lies in check in the old format where he had even less of an incentive to do so cnn did this after agreeing to the term of live fact checking
it would just be a little message box at the bottom of the screen and cnn knew each question ahead of time so they could have had fact checkers on the question ready with info before the question was even asked so it would n't be that delayed
i ’m glad there ’s a name for this verbal shit storm this describes exactly what i saw in the debate from trump it was painfully frustrating
every report about the debate should start with this paragraph
total and complete setup by cnn to sustain the horserace that gets them the dough they ’re shameless lack all integrity and a atrociously greedy network
it ’s not cnn ’s job to fact check trump it ’s biden ’s job to make it clear to the voters that this was a lie if your whole problem with the debate is that cnn did n’t help biden attack trump and give him a free win then you ’ve said more about biden than trump
you mean like saying there are doctors killing viable babies after they are born my mother has said that same thing to me until i said that has never happened she just looked at me after i said it out loud and then she agreed with me
lol when was that a thing
cnn had a cold would be better
different moderators or even a different network everyone does things differently
yeah cnn is the one who looks bad after last night not biden right
ah yes one candidate lied so much that it was literally impossible to refute every single lie so it 's the other candidates fault sounds like a healthy government to me
only if somebody is lying every sentence
so what is a moderator then
this is not as clever as you think it is
i will take someone who ca n't speak but relies on experts to help him over a habitual lying megalomaniac anyday
there is a difference between pushing back on ideas and arguments and fact checking objectively factually untrue statements
biden should n't have to explain what 's plainly fucking visible the problem with this nonsense that these news organizations just reporting what the different parties say is that we end up with a choose your own adventure based on vibes world which is literally fucking killing the species biden is old no fucking shit and yes it would be great if we had a younger version of him but despite his age he 's been objectively the best president in my 54 years of life and frankly i 'd vote for a magic 8 ball before i 'd vote for any republican much less the orange traitor
they are wrong they are the people 's arbiter biden and trump are n't there to fact check for us
claiming democrats support post birth abortion is the first example that comes to mind
fuck cnn that is all
i agree with fuck cnn but note that the debate and its rules were requested by the biden campaign it 's unprecedented for a debate to occur in june when the biden campaign requested that this debate take place and specified the rules under which it would occur they could have required the moderators to pause the debate after each lie in order to perform a fact check also i think the biden campaign could have opted out of debates entirely this year stating that it was demeaning to the office of the presidency to give a convicted felon a national tv stage alongside the sitting president
they are salivating at shit shows they want it to go down in flame
yeah this is bullshit if biden were responsible for fact checking trump he ’d eat up his response time just getting the facts straight the moderators should be fact checking
they could n’t run the risk of fact checking biden
biden lied too buddy all politicians lie
psst the fact checking was n't about biden edit imagine blocking someone for this comment what a coward lmao
have any examples trump lied constantly and at worst it seems like biden exaggerated some stats left out some context which claims that biden made are you considering lies
yup it 's a lot easier to repeat a prerehearsed lie than improvise a response to one on the spot especially as you have no idea what the lie will be from nancy pelosi causing jan 6 to all legal scholars being against roe v wade
and if he just entirely ignored trump ’s bullshit the “ media ” would just be going on about how he ’s afraid to engage
moderators are more for keeping the answers on topic well they really sucked ass at that one
i just want to comment on how shockingly bad ai is in its current form and how it has repeatedly been show to have severe biases it 's great for certain things fact checking is among its biggest weaknesses there are impartial people but you would never know it because republicans and possibly a dem or two are going to cry every time you tell them alternative facts are in fact just lies
young account jp fan yikes
you could have replaced tapper with a chess clock and an index card of suggested topics and it would have been a better debate
i like this approach let the candidate dig his own hole should they chose to but inform the viewers in real time on what is correct
the problem is most of the time trump did n't even remotely address the question asked
two things can look bad at the same time
depending on the audience i guess cnn was trying really hard to be neutral
can you point out more than 1 rebuttal that biden put out there was he so weighed down by all of the debunking he was doing trump said that they are doing post birth abortions the easiest slam dunk you could face in a debate biden 's response crickets trump will end the war in ukraine crickets there was no inflation during trump crickets edit that 's what i thought
yea let me know when they fact check and call out lies vs letting lie after lie after lie be broadcast from a guy who has made threatening remarks towards minority communities but no you got it let 's just pretend that the media is n't allowing him to broadcast things that will end up costing all of us our democracy totally different than what goebbels was known for
not really that 's part of pushing back if your opponent lies then you check it if your opponent says something inaccurate then you check it the moderator is there to ask questions keep time and ensure that the rules whatever they are are followed now i 'd be all for adding a dedicated fact checker to the panel if that 's something that could be worked out but there 's almost no way donald would agree to that
wrong several virginia lawmakers supported this and it was also brought up two weeks ago when asked
pausing the debate at every lie was never feasible they would have fact checked 60 minutes of the 90 minute runtime and left both candidates with just 15 minutes of talk time that means 75 minutes of time focusing on trump 's points and biden getting 15 minutes this is trump 's entire strategy and why hillary said not to get lost in his sauce he will throw out so many lies that you spend all your time debunking and still only get half of them then the audience assumes the other half must have been factual all the while not a single substantive point is made from the democratic platform
i think i would ’ve been cool if they broke it into sections where they had 20 min for economy environment taxes etc etc with a brief break after each where non partisan fact checkers evaluated their claims
it 's unprecedented for a debate to occur in june when the biden campaign requested that this debate take place and specified the rules under which it would occur but this is n't true he suggested not specified the rules or requested not even donald trump pretended that at the time it became news
i have to believe someone in the biden campaign saw the possibility of this disaster and wanted to get it done so as to have time to respond by which i mean replace him
trump lies with every breath nobody even comes close to the amount of lies trump tells it ’s astonishing
trump lies intentionally biden “ lies ” because of confusing rhetoric being fed to him by his team the head of the boarder patrol agency did publicly endorse biden ’s bill and biden but the union did not one of the only unions in the country to not back biden so that ’s an easy misunderstanding that he states trump saying that the agency he meant union endorsed him was the only truth he spoke of in the first 30 min i turned it off after that
biden exaggerated or lied seems like you already know but ca n’t seem to admit it
young account not a jp fan
cnn is n't on the ballot
trump said that they are doing post birth abortions the easiest slam dunk you could face in a debate biden 's response crickets trump will end the war in ukraine crickets there was no inflation during trump crickets what are you talking about biden attempted to reply to all three of those points just proof that trumps gish gallop flood the zone with shit tactic worked on people biden it ’s been a terrible thing what you ’ve done the fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported roe when it was decided supported roe and that was that ’s this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous biden number three we found ourselves in a situation where if you take a look at what trump did in ukraine he ’s this guy told ukraine told trump do whatever you want and do whatever you want and that ’s exactly what trump did to putin encouraged him do whatever you want and he went in biden there was no inflation when i became president you know why the economy was flat on its back 15 % unemployment he decimated the economy absolutely decimated the economy that ’s why there was no inflation at the time
lmao sorry i do n't live on reddit to reply within seconds nice display of patience there furthermore where was he even to begin if he spent time debunking literally every word of lies that came from trumps mouth he 'd literally have zero time for anything else
wrong this has been facht checked and found false in 2019 already the cnn fact check on the debate found more than 30 false claims by felon trump however and let us not start with the more than 30 000 lies he told while being president
don jr is that you
biden should have just said well everything that man said was a lie and continued with his own talking point instead he at times tried to refute trump point by point before losing the plot stumbling then trying to recover
should have an inset sign language interpreter emotively fact checking i bet we would all understand the gestures
or 2 minute answer 1 minute rebuttal 1 minute follow up 3 minutes to explain what trump lied about
then why have you posted multiple times to the sub in the past 2 weeks since you made the account low effort
yeah saying roe was supported is a good rebuttal to the insinuation that abortions are happening post birth this guy told ukraine told trump do whatever you want and do whatever you want and that ’s exactly what trump did to putin encouraged him do whatever you want that 's a rebuttal it 's gibberish
no my name is john
he actually did say exactly that a handful of times
why do n’t you read my posts and see how they are challenges to his sub please do n’t call me low effort when i am trying to have an honest discussion
so did trump though kind of falls flat for those that do n't pay attention
which played even worse to the audiences doing live favorability metering
this supreme court is sending our country to the stone age i fucking hate what the christo fascist gop is doing to this country
this is the most important decision of the year a total gutting of the power of government agencies
another friday ruling so we 're too distracted by the weekend to think much about it before long they 're going to take away weekends too
as a pharmaceutical manufacturing engineer i have experience complying with us food and drug law the laws passed by congress in this area can be pretty general and do require the us fda to fill in the gaps see the code of federal regulations title 21 for good manufacturing practices e g the fda issues explanatory guidance and regularly confers with the regulatory authorities of other countries and industry organizations to clarify and refine regulatory requirements the fda has the expertise medical doctors scientists engineers statisticians etc to review the science behind any drug and its manufacture and evaluate a manufacturer ’s compliance with the regulations that ensure patient safety nobody wants to deliver a contaminated vial of medicine to a sick person or animal and the fda takes this responsibility very seriously we ’ve already seen what happens when companies regulate themselves take boeing innocent lives are lost is the ussc cool with this
religious nut jobs should n’t be allowed to be judges what is worse is they ’re religious far right nut jobs
they are careening towards consequences drunk with power now constrained by legislation soon motherfuckers
at this point it would not surprise me to see them rule that trump and no other president is immune from all prosecution
i 'm glad they saved the best decisions for friday to lead us into a nice weekend
this supreme court needs to be immediately removed from power full stop legalizing the very same crimes they 're accused of committing should have been it under a functioning government they 'd be impeached and tried both in congress and criminal courts for bribery before they had a chance to change the law to protect themselves and make the big play for their corporate sponsors
i did not know that christo fascism is when regulatory agencies are granted less discretion in policy implementation
this is good for democracy you want unelected people making laws
congress already ca n't pass bills imagine what will happen if they have to draft regulations into the legislation nothing will get done
i will say they should n’t have had the atf “ reinterpret ” laws in order to push the administration ’s agenda what constitutes a “ firearm ” is one of the few things that is actually well defined they could n’t pass legislation to change that so they have the atf expand its power and redefine it same shit with the pistol brace nonsense
thank you for laying this out for people that are n't aware of chevron however there 's still one more component of this which came up numerous times in oral arguments the primary problem with chevron is that companies can be faced with different interpretations of the ambiguity every four years or whenever there 's a new potus who appoints a new head of whatever alphabet soup unelected bureaucracy regulates them i do n't think that 's fair to whatever industry and company might have to endure it essentially what the scotus has done is given congress a choice for how it moves forward leave it to judges chaos or create a better more stable solution i think it 's a good decision but i 'll admit it 's going to get worse before it gets better
i only wish gorsuch wrote the opinion considering the case history involved his mom when she was the head of the epa when everything happened that led to the chevron decision either way i 'm looking forward to reading gorsuch 's concurrence with tomorrow morning 's cup of coffee
that ’s not the design of this country tho democracy was always a lie
they did n’t legalize bribery just found that a federal statute dealing with bribery does not cover gratuities something that state and local and even federal laws can separately cover
it 's more facism and stupidity then that basically it 's saying judges can do this better then experts
it ’s just a buzzword i ’ve seen it used for anything in this subreddit
it 's almost like maybe they are n't just talking about this one issue when it comes to such a label for the supreme court that conclusion requires a thought process capable of logical reasoning however anyone denying that the sc has made past decisions that stem from racism or fuel a religious agenda are fools
take literally any objectively bad thing there is in policy these scumbags are all the same and will support that destructive idea i guess that 's where the overlap is no matter what hat the dingdongs are wearing that day
leftist do n’t call anyone they do n’t like a fascist challenge impossible
you know who i want making guidelines about food preservatives food preservative chemists with a phd in the subject md phd 's with special training in carcinogenic preservatives i want eggheads who spent a decade in school and writing research papers to pore over thousands of pages of research then cough up scientifically guided regulations for food preservatives
the chevron doctrine was not about administrative agencies making laws only congress can create federal law t was about courts deferring to experts within the agencies how to interpret when those laws were silent or vague and the experts within these agencies had decades of experience regarding these matters overturning chevron gives conservative puppet justices the ability to side with industry over the us the same people trying to make america great again just massively weakened america
i want experts informing policy i do n't want some joe shmoe elected from back woods west virginia making policy on extremely specialized fields that they know absolutely nothing about this is like asking a farmer to make policy on space flight or a man to make policy on a womans body it 's absolutely fucking moronic couple this with the anti intellectual anti education movement going on around this country being led by religious fucking nut jobs and corporate lobbiests and it 's a recipe for disaster
not at all first we got that fun debate last night then we get a bodyblow to the administrative state and the grants pass decision let 's pour up a whiskey and light a cigar
bull shit that is actually the design of this country specifically in article ii section 4 of the united states constitution which explicitly calls out bribery as an impeachable offense here is a in which it has been used of note is the 2010 case of who was impeached and ultimately convicted for bribery offenses in a case that sounds remarkably similar to justice clarence thomas 's own gratuities
or congress themselves so now our congress gets to spend all their time debating the particulars of railcar specifications and acceptable limits for safe drinking water or else let an unelected judge decide
so anyone you do n’t like is a fascist to you and you admit it
no they blindly want 1984 lmao they want enforcement agencies to be allowed to legislate lmao
so you want an authoritarian regime because the people in charge would be educated if you think this is necessary why would n't you rather have these positions require elections what you are stating is anti democracy there is already the ability to sue for provable harm the people making law should be representatives in a democracy
you hate the us and want it to ne shit hole
except there was actually evidence of corruption against porteous unlike against thomas where its just dumb people who read headlines and parrot whatever john oliver says saying he did something wrong because they do n't like him having a different legal opinion
pretty much its bonkers and designed to make any legislation not court approved to be held up for decades in court
project 2025 they lay it out
so you are telling me there is a huge group of phd specialists willing to run for election and have alternative employment lined up when they lose the election do you think there are huge numbers of phd specialists in food additives
if you actually believe that then we live in different realities dude got houses luxury trips tuition for his kid all from people driving cases to his courtroom where they get favorable rulings that frequently overturn decades old precedent but yeah that 's all above board and totally legit
there ’s no use with them they ’re either ignorant or want it or both
he has an insanely wealthy friend one who allows him to benefit from that wealth in part so that thomas can continue to do the work he does on the bench which people see as important that alone is not corruption corruption requires something to have been corrupted what is an actual case where there was a conflict and he did nt recuse can you point to a ruling where there was a conflict or even an appearance of it where his ruling deviated strongly from his normal jurisprudence i know you read articles where it implies he was corrupt but can you actually point to where it is why would you even bribe the most conservative justice on a court where you need the middles to flip to get rulings in your favor not like thomas flips to the liberal side on occasion
he has an insanely wealthy friend one who allows him to benefit from that wealth rofl said with a straight face i see that you 're a fan of the same back assward logic that the bribed justices hide behind it 's only corrupt if you get an explicit quid pro quo in the form of a contract signed in blood under a full moon otherwise it 's all good
if they let trump off the hook all americans of conscience must hit the streets
they are taking out rights and regulations bit by bit ca n't wait for them to come back for the next term and announce they taking on child labor case and then gut child labor laws and force 3 year olds to work in mines after that slavery will be back this is the trajectory the way shit is going this is not even exaggeration with the way things are going people might have laughed before roe v wade now they have also successfully gutted chevron doctrine we really going down to the bottom and bringing back archaic laws
i found myself scrolling clothing and tea coffee sites last night because it was the only place i could stop being reminded of this awful awful political landscape it 's all so unrelentingly bad every new update from the court is more shitty news being morally sound and law abiding means nothing anymore
at what point do people stop accepting this bullshit and do something about it
rat fucked us enough for this term time for some free vacations and fancy dinners
what are they gon na do next overturn brown v board of education
so no immunity decision for another three days fuck the gop fuck their apologists
well shit now is n't that terrifying and here i thought we were done after today
we 're gon na let bidens debate performance dominate the news cycle until the last day
how do we come back from the chevron ruling
seems like they are making their decision based off of the potential of trump getting reelected my guess is they will not grant him immunity because he now has a higher chance at reelection scotus slow walked this decision so his remaining trials wo n't be able to come to a verdict before the election
what are the other cases trump immunity and the article says 4 but only talks about immunity
they saved the bangers for last fuck
why are they waiting until july i thought their calendar went through june 30 are they actually working over the weekend on the wording of the opinion or is something else going on here
this court is anything but supreme
does n't anybody think that it 's time to set aside the court not just it 's rulings but the whole damned court
i can hardly wait s
in other news clarence gets a new motorhome
translation we have not yet completed tasks assigned to us by leonard leo the fucking of america will continue god bless leonard leo and corporate ceos and thank you mr leo for your now legal and very generous gratuities to the catholic 6
ring and run as we 've been expecting for months
damn at one point all nine justices said the president does n't have qualified immunity according to the article so what 's changed now to warrant another review
in my head robert 's court grants insane unlimited executive protection from prosecution biden immediately sends the conservatives to guantanamo
right before the incoming heatwave
fingers crossed it ’s the last decision these shitheads ever make
wish i could work for a week then take a few months off and still have enough money a gifts from billionaires that i would n't just die of starvation or heat stroke
i ’d say we should already be hitting the streets if there was ever a time for a general strike or a revolution it ’s right fucking now
leave the poor streets alone they have n't done anything to anyone and have a hard enough time as it is
regulations bit by bit today was more than a bit they went for the whole enchilada today undermining the vast majority of all federal regulations
up next legalizing orphan crushing machines
they are going to give trump immunity and flee to othet countries
beatings will continue until morale improves
but the children yearn for the mines
everyone should reach the parable of the sower and the parable of the talents by octavia butler worryingly and shockingly prescient about where our country could be heading
this is not even exaggeration commences in exaggerating
that sounds like a good idea i have really been trying to get my mind off this political landscape all day unsuccessfully
i just made a fantastic shot of espresso from honduran beans i roasted a week ago using a 1 to 3 ratio on a flair 58 it tasted like a chocolate covered pomegranate nestled in a creamy cloud of decadent caramel normally my coffee is fantastic but drinking the espresso while reading the news today made it taste so much better i 'm going to make another shot just for reddit mmmm tastes like freedom
the majority of people do n’t care understand the gravity of the situation it has devolved so deep into red vs blue that that is all the matters now as a expat i am glad i got out ignorance and misinformation won the day years ago and that is the status quo now america was a nifty experiment hate to see it end
time to go accept their after the fact bribes that they just made legal
they 're not quite done with the fuckening yet monday is the season finale when we find out if we have a king
probably rule the constitution as unconstitutional because they got a carnival cruise
segregation is definitely part of the history and tradition of the nation so seems possible
i strongly expect griswold v connecticut and lawrence v texas are the next targets followed by miranda v arizona and gideon v wainwright no exaggeration these are all considered worth revisiting or even wrongly decided by multiple conservative groups as well as sitting scotus justices the only thing needed is for someone to manufacture a case and it 's almost guaranteed they 'll be granted standing
that 's kind of literally what thomas said he planned to do
thomas did say it was wrongly decided
gay marriage is probably next on the chopping block then brown v board of education
yes they will say that religious freedom to have racially segregated education is a protected right exactly what the racists said in 1950s and have it state financed then they might overturn civil rights act as non discrimination laws might also be declared illegal as long as the segregator makes a fig leaf of calling their business a “ church institution ” or something preposterous
part of me wants loving v virginia to come up to watch thomas twist himself in knots
hopefully loving v virginia too edit this was a poke at thomas and his ass backwards views
pleesy v ferguson and the dread scott decision reinstate korematsu and united states v bhagat singh thind everything is vulnerable have the blue states considered session we could leave the bad shit and start anew with all the good things that we want power will be checked and balanced people will have the benefit of dignity we can call the red state folks “ illegal aliens when the try to come in from their hell scapes
with vouchers for charter schools draining public education into a death spiral they can let that one die of natural causes there ’s still plenty of other progressive policies in place that could use the axe i ’m sure the sunshine act for pharmas bribing doctors seems basically useless now so why not kill it the endangered species act has no historical precedent in the 1700s so why keep that the 14th amendment still has a few teeth in it why not take a wrecking ball to that further with the gender affirming care case they just took up that ’s a two fer cause you trounce the queers too s this is so fucking depressing to watch
happy independence day america here ’s a king
the ironic thing about chevron is it was originally put in place to defend the reagan ’s administration ’s weakening of an epa regulation by saying that judges should be generally deferring to the epa experts on possibly ambiguous readings of technical statutes that ruling overturned a lower court ruling in favor of an environmental advocacy group that had sued the epa over the policy change they made so now a conservative group of justices has overturned a decision that was previously won by conservative business advocates which means that this is opening the door for environmental groups to again sue a potential gop administration ’s epa for example when they reverse course on some older policy and a judge will have to decide if the epa is reading the law correctly basically i think this is going to down the road end up being a leopards eating gop faces type of ruling yeah it ’s a ruling that in the short term is intended to help industry plaintiffs who do n’t like progressive regulations but it ’s going to be a ruling that also lets progressives sue gop led administrations when they try to undo progressive regulations as well if scotus thinks this will makes things easier for themselves they ’re going to be disappointed
they are going to throw trump another bone by sending the case back down to the district court to decide whether attempting to overthrow the government of the united states was within trump ’s official duties as president so when chutkan takes 5 seconds to correctly decides it is not within a president ’s official duties to overthrow the government of the united states trump can appeal it and keep the delay going
moody v netchoice llc netchoice llc v paxton corner post v board of governors of the federal reserve system trump v u s
my guess it ’s because june 30th landed on a sunday this year
it ’s a bought court what did you expect integrity
oh hell he is getting a private jet and a house in maui this term
i ’ve seen calls for a general strike for over 20 years nobody wins a general strike there are no shortcuts here the solution is voting good people with sound policy into office again and again
is that like the mental handicap shredders in development or the lgbt euthanasia coaster seriously i feel like all progress made in the last 70 years is just being wiped out but they are n’t bringing back the fairness doctrine or the type of economy from that time period we ’re headed straight back to robber barons with a christo fascist twist
if the founding fathers would have wanted a ban on orphan crushing machines they would have put it in the constitution
only trump too not presidents cuz that would include biden and they ca n’t have that
nah this is a decades long plan since the 60 's look up the powell memo voters just got lost in the propaganda and the predators grabbed it all divide and rule
shrinking the size of the federal government means slavery will be back do n’t you see
of course i 'm still reading news about it in spite of everything but i will not click on any stupid commentary or shouty tv talking heads this is biden 's equivalent of the access hollywood moment except he 's merely old and not actively committing sexual assault i suspect biden horrified many supporters but trump 's gaslighting and nonstop lying only confirms the need to keep him far far away from the wh we already know this trashfire supreme court is going to forgive trump and grant him immunity for past and future crimes it will only reinforce the need for biden 's victory
these people are really low iq they ca n't help it giuliani alex jones these people are all caught in the throes of some crisis so i ca n't even be mad their customers are in even worse shape to be sending money to these emotionally unstable frauds
i 'm glad you were able to get out i 'm outside the red blue paradigm myself and i probably read too much for my own good because i 've turned into a cassandra over the years just screaming into the void and nobody would listen welp here we are the beginning of the end and some people still do n't realize it there are going to be a lot of liberals caught flat footed and unprepared it 's a damn shame but it 's not like we did n't warn them
clarence thomas will hold up a mirror and say “ i ’m white ” and then vote to overturn it
i remember when the draft decision overturning roe was leaked and loving v virginia was included in the list of cases alito thought were wrongly decided it was dropped from the final draft probably because thomas pointed out to alito that loving directly affected his life so it was cool
i half suspect that ’s what the supermajority will do there is literally no check on their power abs boring anyone can do once they rule trump immune from prosecution
it will allow them to cannon decisions while letting the status quo ride years long backlogs
yep this was always the play delay till the last second throw it back to the lower courts delay again when it inevitably gets thrown back up to them
nothing aside from the highest court tampering with an ongoing criminal trial as a means of election interference justice delayed is justice denied
there are n't any rulings pending the rulings were all made long ago they just choose to do this shit for the theatrics which is ridiculous there 's nothing stopping them from releasing this stuff as they finish it imagine if you told your boss you would hand him all of your work for the year on december 31st and to not bother you until then
i used to expect them to follow the law to follow legal precedent not anymore true they have been bought and sold to the highest bidder
they ’re not on the ballots
yeah i ’m sure john roberts is executing a plan from the 60s
it was sarcasm and a poke at thomas
i think op was being sarcastic as it would directly affect thomas
that ’s not true joe biden is a good person with sound policies he ’s just a shit public speaker
all authoritarian oligarchs are the same all over the world and yes i do think he was in school listening to the people writing that memo do you know that roger stone was part of the nixon administration do you know that a bunch of george w bushes admin were part of the nixon administration as young bucks do you actually understand how mentorship works and long term thinking cuz the f oligarchs do
honey that they have sat on the immunity ruling for as long as possible is a crime against justice justice delayed is justice denied
it 's not a conspiracy it 's how they 've chosen to do business they like the attention and the power that comes with just dropping massive bombs on the country during the last week of june before they go on vacation until october ha ha sucks to be you guys see ya in three months it is what it is and all i 'm saying is it does n't have to be like that
darling i know that the entire heritage foundation judiciary has mobilized to obstruct justice i have eyes and ears apparently they love the sale of top secret documents to foreign adversaries
within the dem circle or just being floated by talking media heads i mean she seems pretty good but i want to hear that the dem thinktank is actually discussing changing course i do n't really care what pundits think
i ’d happily and proudly vote for her in a heartbeat and i would feel enthusiastic enough to volunteer with my local party to help her campaign i know it ’s a risk to drop an incumbent this close to an election but good god the apathy is an issue my mom who supports biden ’s policies just sounds so defeated she says she wo n’t vote and i tried to convince her an uninspiring candidate is better than trump and while she agreed i could tell she was n’t swayed the people yearn for someone young inspiring and with a force of personality to counter trump ’s bile she ’s it 100 %
best argument for whitmer is that she secures us mi and probably helps a lot in pa and wi i think shapiro and pritzker are also good choices maybe some combination of 2 of those 3
i ’d vote for a soggy potato over trump but i would be far more enthusiastic to support big gretch
michigan would be a lock likely wisconsin and pennsylvania too there would likely be historic turnout from women over the possibility of a woman president mobilizing in response to roe i 've never heard bad press from either the moderate and progressive wings of the party no brainer whitmer 2024
i absolutely love gretchen whitmer “ it ’s shark week motherf r ” that still cracks me up every time
no chance whitmer is on the ticket unless kamala is replaced as well they are n't going to run a ticket with 2 women it 's all moot point though because biden is n't getting replaced i 'm pretty sure the money the biden campaign has raised ca n't just be handed over to another campaign money is a pretty essential part of a campaign
100 % let 's do it it would be amazing to watch a woman defeat trump
big gretch come save us
i ca n't view the article to see who is saying she 's being floated so i 'm inclined to think this is just gossip in the press between friends
i think its a very risky political gambit to change candidates at the convention more risky than rolling with biden that said ill vote for anyone over trump
she ’s long been my preferred candidate i do n’t blame her if she does n’t want to try her run with basically zero notice
should have been her or pete as vp then we would n't have to force biden to step up again as the last hope against the trump vile
floated by pundits and newspapers not by anyone in the democratic party leadership this is attempting to choose a candidate via editorialization
someone pointed out it was last 1876 that a party switched and won and despite my deepest wishes sexism is still a thing blue no matter who here but rural pa so maybe the most obvious and logical choice is biden or trump and given the electoral tilt any ass sitting or 3rd party is also trump as i tell the kids being a grown up is choosing between shitty choices and hot take trump is by far the shittiest the most est
this seems like such a slam dunk for the dems if played right give a couple weeks and let biden take an out on his health based on the rigors of campaign trail he wants to focus doing the job he has and allow the next generation to carry america forward etc etc whitmer is well positioned to take on trump she ’s smart she ’s strong and i ’m sure she ’s got no love for the stupidity of the man or his gang of imbeciles and crooks that worship him remember she was the target of a failed political abduction by his shit for brains followers as an ohioan i ’m voting for whoever is on the top of the dem ticket but i ’d happily vote for her instead just against trump
i will take pritzker over whitmer but at this point anyone who 's not named biden will reset the bar for the democrats unless that person agrees with the worst of biden 's current policies
obama needs to convene a smoke filled room and sort this shit out asap the odds and consequences of biden crumpling further are just too high give biden an off ramp to save face figure out a mechanism to nominate a replacement still four months till november which is plenty of time for a new candidate to establish themselves can the democratic establishment do this i highly doubt it
sounds like biden is going to dig in if he were to step down it needs to be asap the longer this drags on the harder and more unlikely it will be for dnc to put someone else up his speech today was fiery indicating that he will take a lot of persuading for him to decline the nomination it 's not going to happen quickly frankly i do n't see it happening at all this is going to be wild
pretty much the only democratic viable alternative candidate you ca n't speed date a national election which is what you 're asking anyone to do who replaces biden you 're supposed to go through a long drawn out process of campaigning debating and winning primary elections for a reason i like newsom a lot and if you give him 12 months to go through a full democratic primary then i think he likely comes out on top for a lot of reasons but throwing him in this type of situation probably backfires for his political aspirations but i think you can turn this into a swing state election and bring in someone like whitmer who has midwest appeal cache to win michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin and hope the usual strongholds do n't fall to trump
yep the fact that these choices are being floated is enough to tell me that democrats are learning from it though biden himself does n’t seem to want to step down and is trying to limit damage to himself not so sure if it had worked now that these are out in the open
she is the democrats best bet to beat trump
i doubt this and if it was true there are still more seasoned politicians that should be seen over whitmer bernie warner newsom booker etc
is it just me or should they be incredibly safe and nominate a white guy like gavin newsome just feels like against trump nominating a woman or poc could backfire
i am going to vote for a dead corpse this election if they prop it up as the candidate 28 is a different story
old decent grandpa vs a fascist convicted felon the choice is pretty simple
this is stupid clickbait zero chance they skip over the sitting vice president and nominate whitmer i 'm not saying kamala is the right choice i 'm saying they would n't nominate whitmer over her especially last second like this
harris and whitmer i ’m game
seems very unrealistic i think if the dnc jumped ship on biden they ’d play it very safe and as much as gretchen rocks i do n’t think they ’d go that way that is to say i do n’t think they ’d pick a woman
i think whitmer would be a great candidate but i do n’t know that enough independents would support her over trump in a general i think gavin newsom is probably the best bet this cycle that said if the party picks her i ’ll support her over trump
if the dnc could post up someone under the age of 60 that would be great
as much as i like her i think it 's just too late in the cycle to change the candidate the horse race has begun and there 's no stopping now i hope she runs in 2028 though
sorry but is n’t it too fucking late should n’t this have been put in motion like 3 5 years ago
i ’d vote for my dog over trump and she has some shit takes so i ’m down
we have the republican who is a criminally insane twice impeached convicted felon and a dem who is obviously suffering from cognitively impairment why not vote for a sane third alternate
i would like to see a pete gretchen ticket in 2024 i also like shapiro
the passive voice in headlines about some action taken is highly misleading it begs the question who floated her i 'm sure the answer is in the article but i 'm not going to reward clickbait everyone always has some unique preferred candidate tell me why it matters more than everyone else 's choice
there was no debacle biden is n't going anywhere stop with this nonsense
i seen at least one poll that shows literally any generic dem wins out over both trump and biden like i ’m p sure not even naming names of well known ppl just democrat but not biden and suddenly dems are looking much better it ’s only one poll that i ’ve seen but come on man this is getting ridiculous
i do n't care but anyone that is n't pure evil there and i 'll vote for them over the pure evil guy
the problem is that we all assumed we were stuck with biden in the first place do tell what happens if he were to kick over within the next couple of months kamala is even less popular than him
this is the problem there are at least 3 excellent candidates to jump on which is why it wo n’t happen they would have to step aside yesterday and support one person and it ai n’t happening
ca n't wait to vote for her in 2028
nothing is changing unless someone dies stop wasting time arguing about this
i floated her name yesterday does that count she ’s great
i 've been saying for years roy cooper is a solid pick boring but looks and talks like a president
not a chance with 4 months to go too late at best we can hope for is pick a really likable vp and expedite the media vetting process if we loose this election there may be no coming back from this our entire political system is so fucking broke its not even funny the media is just a joke status quo is not working he has a cold my foot there should be a slogan after this ” never again ” stuck between a wanna be dictator and someone who is going senile i like biden he seems to me as a good man but he is old and has problems we are not healthy as a nation when this is the “ best ” choices that our shitty two party system crams down our throat troubling times
oh so now you want to have a real primary rnc and dnc fail our democracy do n’t think that it ’s one or the other do n’t take sides both are equally incompetent and are a disgrace to our nation
my neighbors sweet couple in their 70s and still leftist hippies they sounded defeated this morning
if the democrats want the white house they will do whatever they can to make this happen as she is one of the few candidates that can reliably beat trump
in all due respect governor whitmer does n't have the national recognition needed to defeat trump i can think two potentially better candidates those being newsome of california or pritzker of illinois
seems he just said on stage in north carolina that he is still running
she would be an excellent choice probably the best given that abortion is still the big issue and a woman can make that case better then a man old or otherwise i would n't push harris off the ticket though she is n't a great choice for the top spot an all female ticket is a wildcard but the downside of pushing out harris is potentially worse all that said this is still all on biden he is the only one who can pull this trigger i think he has two to three weeks to show that last night was just a bad night and not his true self him leaving the ticket is the only real way the dems can replace him he has to make that choice if the winds do n't change soon i hope he sees the writing on the wall
i like whitmer personally the problem with this despite the chaos of swapping candidates and raised is trump would basically turn the election into a referendum about covid lockdowns and i do n't know that she 'd come out on top
this would be career suicide
americans really ca n't handle someone being bad on tv
biden is not backing down sorry he 's making that clear he 's too arrogant and selfish if someone challenges him without him willingly giving it up then democrats are entirely screwed regardless he 's going to literally gift both the presidency and congress to republicans i blame all the media outlets who covered for him his power obsessed wife that 's clearly pushing for him to run and probably making policy calls and every democrat who did n't push for any alternative
i 've never been on board with replacing biden i feel it is too late is 4 months really enough time for any democratic candidate to campaign against trump trump will surly use a change of candidate this late on as an attack vector citing democrat 's in disarray however after last night i 'm not entirely against this last minute gamble
wes moore is a better candidate than whitmer because he does n't have the covid lockdown baggage a lot of people in swing states are still upset about that
people say they will vote for the woman until they are a candidate then they are “ not a good candidate ” a few examples are clinton harris and warren whitmer would suffer the same fate
whitmer cheney liz why not most of the dems in dc are moderate republicans anyway maybe the dick would like to see real respect for the cheney family and the republican party again before he passes can you see both of them yelling at rallies these thugs have tried to kill me and democracy and they have failed we stop the koch cabal here an now there is not a doubt in my mind putin would shit a brick looking liz cheney in the eyes think about it
should have made her or newsom his running mate to comfort folks about his age a long time ago right or wrong kamala is n’t very popular and there is n’t enough time to change that image dems unnecessarily pushed all in on the debate and it ’s backfired horribly
i ’d like to see a newsome moore ticket
i feel there 's no feasible way to swap out a candidate this close to november i could see it as a possibility if we were a year or more away but sadly we are only like 5 months away
yes whitmer or harris or even someone from the squad anybody but grandpa
if they opt for another candidate because of all this then there 's valid argument that biden can not remain president a day longer
someone should tell her because she does n't seem interested given she 's backing biden
whitmer is not a good governor even signed northern michigan resident
why is n’t kamala the next prez candidate instead of gretchen
yeah brilliant idea let 's swap out our incumbent candidate with a strong record as president and vp and in the senate with a national unknown with no vetting no foreign policy credentials and only a few years into her second term as governor of some podunk state into the election and onto the national stage at the last minute what could go wrong see sarah palin
cool idea but if half the country has to ask who not the best choice and if we stick to reality a woman wo n't win sexism is huge in politics
so democrats will appoint their leader without voters just through a committee reminds me of the ccp
within the dem circle or just being floated by talking media heads neither it was just some people on reddit and twitter
15 people on twitter mentioned it totally not bots though so it must be legit news
the article says her name keeps being mentioned by pundits and news media not by anyone in democratic party leadership basically this is an attempt to select a presidential candidate via editorialization
fabricated nonsense from the media to make the race seem more dramatic
yeah it ’s total nonsense she ’s like c tier at best and everyone know gavin has more name recognition and pull for those that would never vote for a woman
there are probably only two people who could launch a nationwide campaign tomorrow and she ’s not one of them
i 'm going to vote but yeah i understand your mom 's feelings elect this 82 year old guy so things do n't get worse is really not inspiring
remind your mom she 's not just voting for biden but for everybody who biden puts in his cabinet and administration biden is old for real but he 's surrounded himself with capable experienced people who do all the work trump gets back in we 'll get the likes of stephen miller steve bannon rick perry betsy devoss and louis dejoy again or even worse
drive her to the voting booth yourself offer to buy her dinner if she 'll go with you i 've never had a problem with my parents voting for people they were n't inspired by they still feel it 's a civic duty but some people may need more coaxing
there 's still a stark difference biden has smart advisors idea people and talent under him coming up with ways to make this country better those are the day to day people really doing the work biden is just like a general manager overseeing it all trump on the other hand we know will have vile people working for him they already are vocal about the damage they will cause project 2025 and trump has no morals so he 'll sign off on all of it your mom and others that feel similar after last night aren''t voting for 1 person they 're voting for the larger group of people each candidate will put into place and be surrounded by
dude honestly idgi i know its true voters stay home but how do you care so little about your future it 's fine nobody likes kamala but it 's obviously better than trump
blows my mind that people like this are willing to let trump and his cronies finish destroying the country and our lives with project 2025 because they 're uninspired i 'm guessing she can afford that attitude because she 's postmenopausal
whitmer 2028 would be a better strategy
sorry to say this but either this is made up or your mom is a terrible person knowing what trump said last night she knows what is a stake
i think it would fire up democrats and some independents biden age is just such a damper
i agree i think she ’d be a great contrast to trump head to head and being midwest is valuable
this is what scars me trump proved you do n’t win but getting the “ swing ” voters you win by turning out the base how you just not vote when the other side is vile
i ’ve been saying for a while “ we get what we deserve ” if people like your mom ca n’t be bothered to save democracy we do n’t deserve it
the magas will be delighted to hear that they ’re going to fall in line no matter what i ’m glad your mom feels like she can afford apathy
if she wo n’t vote because this debate then she has no clue what is at stake show her the sotu address from earlier this year
i ’m voting third party over biden that debate was a national embarrassment and biden showed how he is unfit for office
i ’ve been thinking the same thing i would actually be hopeful and feel encouraged to get involved again
best argument for whitmer is that she secures us mi and probably helps a lot in pa and wi i think she 'd lock down ohio too ohio is gerrymandered to hell and back but deep down it 's still the purple state it always was
misogyny is rampant whitmer is going to lose a lot of people for that prtizker 's chicago there 's endless corruption talking points there he 's functionally newsom with how much ammo that 's going to give for the rnc to hammer home and scare moderates shapiro is seemingly more conservative than biden on israel palestine also was anti vaccine mandate honestly he 's more conservative than biden across the board people downthread are mentioning beshar and he 's the same issue more conservative than biden same with mark kelly literally everyone suggested has either a a worse shot than biden if he 's given the 5 months to actually rehab a little from this b more conservative than biden and the party platform would do a great job of pushing more left leaning folks away at an even higher rate give the man his team some time
i ’ll have to look at those i think andy beshear would do a lot to heal being from kentucky
i feel like tony evers gets overlooked a lot here is it because of his age he 's 72 he keeps winning wi feels like he 'd be a decent vp option or the ky governor beshear i kind of like people who win tough states not heavy blue ones which is another reason why whitmer is probably one of the better candidates
you entirely over estimate whitmer 's ability to secure michigan there 's a reason the convicted felon keeps holding rallies here and that 's because he has a lot of supporters that are out in the country which is like 80 % of this state
stick her on newsom ’s ticket
wait ' til the 100 billion oppo machine gets ahold of her
how did that historic turnout of women work in 2016
a whitmer newsome primary battle would have really fired up dem voters
only negative thing i can think of is that her husband tried using her name to get his boat dock opened during early pandemic when it was n’t allowed yet that s about it
globally speaking female candidates from the more liberal party ca n't win hillary lost to trump ffs i d love to see it i would n't bank on it this nation is half fascist and you have to work within that reality a female candidate ca n't win yet
i hate the kamila argument she had 4 years to get america to like her and she could n’t next
vp should be a popular democrat from a border state
so newsom whitmer or vice versa kamala has to go
kamala being axed is the cherry on top
biden is losing in new jersey according to a poll today why get humiliated by trump when you can instead make texas florida and ohio in reach for the dems
we had a reality tv star rapist president and a mixed race president two women is too far i do n't think so run it and see what happens that 's what we 've been doing for the last decade and a half
good god please stop fretting about losing and actually try to win democrats
gretchen whitmer andy beshear 2024 lets fkin go
that shit is why we got him in the first place it 's also why ginsberg did n't retire and why roe is gone instead of trying to make history how about just beating trump
i can read the article and it 's exactly that
a foiled plot by deranged trumpers to abduct her would be a great story to tell on stage when asked about the dangers of trump ’s rhetoric
as someone living in illinois i 'd hate to lose pritzker but i think it would be best for the country
who the fuck is pritzker
obama as vp for bernie pres or michelle
you 're supposed to go through a long drawn out process of campaigning debating and winning primary elections for a reason except the current population of the united states absolutely loves shiny new toys the media especially they 'll happily carry the necessary water to get america acquainted with someone new even in four short months think about the boner they had for desantis
in this case the alternative is trump so all of the rules are out it does n’t even matter how bad at policy the democratic candidate is the next 4 years if democracy survives to 2030 that ’s better than losing to trump
you gave us biden you shits
these are not choices being floated by democratic party leadership according to the article this is pundits and newspaper columnists speculating
i do n’t think anything significant will occur til next week obviously biden is n’t going to start acting like he ’s gon na drop out the next day if there is some massive shifts next week in internal polling it might trigger something more aggressive but they ’re going to stand fast unless there ’s more rigid signs which would take a bit of time to manifest
i do n't think it 's safe to nominate a ca governor i do n't think people realize how much california is criticized especially in the upper midwest you ca n't do an all ca ticket so now you 're replacing harris i just think the optics just do n't really work
newsome is probably the least safe alternative
newsom would lose horribly in nv and az
suburban and rural people do n’t like newsom or california slick talker and would likely destroy trump in a debate but he is too elitist in my opinion
he also happens to be pretty good and more well known maybe just maybe it ’s safe because he ’s good and not because of his race or gender i also do n’t agree that he is uber safe people hate ca
because unless everyone that would ’ve voted for biden votes for the alternate then fascism wins
voting third party is exactly what party of the insane convicted felon wants undecided dems voters to do the right will fall in line like always
one of them is n't supporting a felon rapist liar
to win the electoral college you do n’t need national recognition the only states you need recognition in are wisconsin michigan pennsylvania georgia north carolina nevada and arizona the other states just vote along party lines no matter whose name is on the ballot
you ’re not wrong and that ’s what really pisses me off the democratic party has had 8 years since hillary lost to put someone on a national stage and make them the future of the party even when biden won 4 years ago and it was apparent that kamala was n’t going to be that person they did nothing but bank on trump being unelectable people love to say that people get the government we deserve but we are going to get the government that was chosen by a bunch kingmakers who outsmarted other kingmakers
do you have a link to his nc rally i 'd like to watch it today to get last night out of my head
that 's what most head coaches say just before they 're fired too i think the next 3 weeks will be interesting to follow
obama should hit him with club and tell him to step down from election
i am praying that joe 's hubris does n't get the best of him and that he steps aside for the good of the nation
and actually sounding good edit i forgot we have to continue to stay pessimistic here without remotely providing positive developments carry on
i lived through her lockdown it was necessary to keep slave driving employers from forcing people into work the only head scratcher was making sales of paint and home improvement items illegal possibly because too many people were showing up at the home depot she managed it really well
that governor that maga tried to kidnap probably for being too nice to minorities
is 4 months really enough time for any democratic candidate to campaign against trump in the current media environment absolutely the networks would fall all over themselves to have a shiny new toy to dangle in front of voters
100 % he would refuse to debate anyone that replaced biden then would use the replacement process and the vacuum of information on their presidential platform to paint any replacement as a further left of biden candidate
yes 4 months is plenty of time unless it is harris then they ’ll have 4 years and 4 months to get it together
countries literally hold entire elections in a fraction of that time
i like wes moore he ’d definitely be a good pick
why you want gramps to run the show
no do not trust liz cheney ever
other countries hold entire elections in shorter time than the time between now and november they absolutely still can do it
lol yeah amazing that she has n't within 12 hours denounced the candidate of her party and announced her own candidacy she must not be interested
well of course she has to say that at this point she would n't want to be seen as a usurper if he bows out gracefully that 's her chance
yeah that 's a check mark against her any democrat that ca n't see that biden will lose the election is well a loser they need someone with the courage and common sense to see that biden is not the way
explain your thoughts please i ’ve felt she ’s done great for our great lake state so much more in tune with the people than snyder and granholm
i do n’t have a dog in this fight since i ’m from ma but someone from washington calling michigan a podunk state is funny
comparing whitmer to sarah palin is absurd whitmer is ready for the national stage
your classifying of michigan the key state to the entire election and the tenth most populated state as podunk is pretty hilarious biden had little chance to win before last night and now he has zero chance nobody is voting for what they saw last night whitmer or anyone would have a small chance to catch lightning in a bottle but even a small chance is better than no chance whitmer has midwest credentials which is where the election will be decided so its either her pritzker or shapiro at this point charging ahead with biden is a sure loss
gov whitmer is intelligent able and competent she is the exact opposite of the dingbat sarah palin ninja edit thanks for the instant downvote children
idk vs trump who might not be the worst i mean everyone known has more issues than her tbh hillary already lost to trump and america does n't like her harris has worse favorables than biden why should he step down to put up someone more hated michelle people have to stop with it looks like a naked attempt from the dnc to loophole around term limits for barack dems replace senile biden with 83 year old those headlines are why bernie is a non starter newsom has the ca problem and will struggle in the rust belt i legit think whitmer is stronger than him if we are talking about wining the most important states this cycle anyone else i think has the same name issues maybe pete but if you think being a woman is bad i 'd argue homophobia sexism politics wise
do you want ole joe
the other guy had his family literally take over the rnc lol
it ’s major publications campaign advisers etc also some redditors like me if biden steps down then i think newsom or whitmer are the best replacements
newsom has the california problem that makes winning the rust belt very hard plus he has some pretty decently well known baggage also his ex wife is currently with donald trump jr whitmer is unknown nationally but probably guarantees you michigan and probably is a better bet than newsom for pa and wi to boot you 're probably punting ga nv and az but newsom probably was n't winning those either
gavin cheated on don jr 's wife when he was married to her with his secretary why tf would people want the guy who was married to a host of fox five to have his ex cry crocodile tears about how the democrats are hypocrites for attacking trump about his supposed affairs while nomating the man that cheated on her it does n't make any sense and would just make all the attacks over trump cheating for the past 8 years look like utter hypocrisy
i think the better argument is elect the guy who has been doing a good job who is terrible at debate and public speaking or you know stay home and kiss it all goodbye
yeah but if you do n't things will get worse not much to really think about and biden and the people around him has proved they can do it
while i am not losing any sleep over the debate really my vote is a vote against trump biden just happens to be the recipient
hey now he ’s only 81
that ’s because our country is on the edge of crisis of the likes we ’ve never seen i do n’t understand why anyone would expect any positivity or inspiration in this climate we are desperate and we do n’t have the luxury to claw back a semblance of democracy in style your options are “ walking corpse biden ” or “ the end of free society and western liberalism as we know it ” if you ’re mad about not being “ inspired ” you ’re missing the point we should all be scared for our lives if trump is elected i do n’t give a flying fuck how much his opponent inspires me
i hope biden lives 20 more years but we must be realistic about his and trump 's age if any of them passed away tomorrow or the day after they were elected nobody would be surprised because it 's perfectly natural to die suddenly of natural causes at that age just imagine if biden croaks the day before the elections i would still vote for his corpse but many probably would n't vote at all
and younger versions of alito and thomas
you ca n't play whack a mole with a widespread national issue of folks not believing biden is up to 4 more years of this
drive her to the voting booth yourself offer to buy her dinner if she 'll go with you i did n't finish reading guttig 's comment and i thought you meant drive her gretchen whitmer to the voting booth yourself offer to buy her whitmer dinner if she 'll go with you and to be honest i would
how is beshear more conservative than biden
beshear has won a red state multiple times as governor i 'd take him in a heartbeat against trump
i see your pts plus alotta them lack the name recognition to win but what about a sanders who is older but hits with the left and he is just much sharper than biden and one of these moderate governors as vp give me some of the attack angles
she is on record as not loving the nickname but the rap song is awesome
let them it 'll increase her name recognition and juice dem turnout plus they only have a few months to dig up make dirt on her
yeah like harris all i heard about her was how she prosecuted people for marijuana use she was the devil for that alone prior to that on committees during the trump admin people fucking loved her sass total 180 just due to media manipulation
roe v wade was n’t as much of an issue then hillary already had a bad controversial reputation and the threat of fascism was not to the levels it is with this current election cycle
whitmer is n’t even close to as disliked as hilary was by the average voter and abortion was still a right then not really comparable situations or people at all
right more people will vote against her than for her for being a woman unfortunately
this is why i want to see an open televised convention let delegates vote on a field of candidates let the candidates give speeches have debates etc narrow the field down little by little until someone emerges victorious make it like a reality tv show and have viewers vote for fun but let the already elected delegates decide people like pete aoc and bernie can all be candidates and it will likely come down to newsom or whitmer but the process would draw so much attention and get younger audiences engaged and excited even if their candidate does n’t win and when it ’s all over we would have a vigorous new platform roaring right into the election republicans would get trounced
mayor mckinsey i 'll pass thanks
100 % she 's not the future
mark kelly there 's not a lot to choose from no high ranking tx dems nm gov has a lot of baggage and the 2 senators are unknowns az has sinema who left the party so pretty much the only border dem would be mark kelly
i am thinking black man on the ticket with gretchen maybe warnock
what 's the plan for victory
hell yeah that would be epic
it 's insulting to suggest that gretchen whitmer 's potential candidacy would be solely about making history she won michigan in 2022 by ten points
i was going to say the same thing i do think pritzker is sharp and forceful enough to rebut all of trumps lies so that would be very fun to watch
former leader of wagner mercenary group faked his death last year gained some weight and now he 's the governor of illinois
pritzker is the person you did n't google before typing who the fuck is pritzker
governor of the 6th largest state in the country
obama ca n't be vp legally he 's served two terms
bernie is older than biden dude
i know but still the fact that this is happening and gaining traction in fact privately i am sure that the democrats are plotting something completely unexpected
having lived in upper midwest and california yes the people are critical but i always tell them do n't knock it until you 've tried it california is awesome
you have a point i know has done a lot of good work for michigan and people
i do n't think people realize how bad a trump second term would be including the dnc the fact so many people think project 2025 is a conspiracy theory even though it is very much real and is the main backer of trump why is n't the dnc targeting them as much as trump it amazes me that we get stuck with biden but those same people who stuck us with biden are now getting cold feet and we the constituents who vote are left to pick up the pieces
i just saw it and it was astonishing he looked like a completely different person energetic strong eloquent how is this possible
that is about the time frame i give him he either goes full court press and shows that last night was just a horrible night for him and he is still up for the job or the talk of him stepping down will get too loud for him to ignore of course he is n't the only candidate the next three weeks will likely be difficult for trump too the supreme court will be putting out their immunity ruling which he will not win if they were going to grant him immunity there is no reason to delay the ruling as long as possible he is going to be sentenced for his current conviction and he has the republican convention right after this is all still on joe biden though even if trump ends up behind bars awaiting a fall trial in dc for his role in the insurrection biden needs to show last night was an aberration or he needs to step aside he has three weeks
he 's too arrogant to do that
i agree with you but the amnesia people have about those days the type of people that need to be swayed makes me worry but hey i 'd vote for her and campaign donate etc there are very few democrats i would n't though i 'm an easy mark this time around
she also had her fun having get togethers and wanting their boat put in the water for the memorial day weekend during the lockdown
it does n't help that the internet is all unrestrained i d and knee jerk reactions
i heard it was the feds that were planning that whole op
liz cheney said one good thing in that trump was the worst she then voted on every item he wanted in the house because the gop pushed it she ’s shit
i am highly confident that vast majority of uninformed not tuned in likely voters do n't even have a clue who she is
well she violated her own lockdown orders twice almost three times she wants to raise the gas tax when she promised she would n’t wants to completely shut down line 5 instead of restoring replacing which means propane will either have to be trucked in or transported via train which means higher costs for those who rely on line 5 for gas and areas in canada would be affected too the federal government had to give the state money so we could actually make real progress to “ fix the damn roads ” we are one of the worst states for education we are losing more residents than we are taking in she bribed gm with tax money to expand ev plants and that ended up backfiring as the big three loses money on ev sales so that means people got ta get laid off the “ historic ” union contract the uaw got has already led to more layoffs we have had minimal job growth as a state recently all she has been doing is nonstop tweeting on how abortion is legal here and trump is a bad choice for president i have a love hate opinion on the right to work repeal so i ’m not gon na go into that wants to build giant silicon manufacturing plants here great idea as it promotes job growth but it ’s where she wants them built the places she wants are out in the farmlands and natural growth areas of the state granholm did better with a far worse situation than what whitmer got our state was dogshit at the end of engler and she made it into a more marketable pile of dogshit snyder pretty much maintained what granholm did at least detroit has n’t went bankrupt under whitmer i ’ll give her that a personal opinion i am pro gun and she ’s not very pro gun edit i will give her a win for eliminating that 1 million dollar insurance policy or whatever it was for auto insurance
anything not on the glorious west coast podunk
what about all the primaries we ’ve already had should n’t the states who have voted once get a shot at voting for biden or whitmer and is a women a good choice to go against trump we saw what happened when we tried that before
and he cheated on that ex wife
i said i 'm going to vote i 'm worried others wo n't and besides people are n't viewing this as bad at public speaking they 're viewing this as biden is an old man who is n't fit to be president
this is the best argument to make luckily running the country does n't involve debating
i feel like being good at public speaking and debate should be a requirement for the job of president of the united states of america
so this we are n't electing biden to debate people we are electing him to run the country which he has done a great job at the last four years if the biden is old media narrative is enough to keep you home you have zero critical thinking skills
you and i and 99 % of r politics agrees i 'm worried about the swing voters and the undecideds and the ones who might just say fuck it they both suck i 'm staying home
as a former conservative this thinking is so weird to me we are trained early on to vote for whoever is on our ticket i left the hospital after my c section on the day of the election took my newborn to the polling place in a not so safe neighborhood and stood in line to vote for arnold schwarzenegger to oust gray davis i 've voted for shitty governors congressmen and senators because the alternative was letting the other side win conservatives are patient and sneaky that 's why they have so many spots on the courts that 's why years ago they publicly announced they would focus on taking state houses to allow them to redraw district maps and ensure they could never lose again they think long term thanks to trump i 'm no longer a republican i 'm still adjusting to the thinking on this side of the political divide where voting is more about feeling good about a candidate and less about ensuring the other side loses
when people say vote shaming does n't work this is what they mean it is the party and the candidate 's responsibility to run a campaign that can generate enthusiasm
that 's what vps are for
yup i actually feel people speaking up is the best way to handle this if enough people say they wo n’t vote this should end it old people just do n’t want to give up power
i 'll be the first to admit he has less policy to work off than anyone else but a lot of this is because he 's a blue governor in a red state what he 's going to be able to get done are things that are generally agreeable and not too controversial but the general consensus is that he 's a moderate and when put in a position like the presidency i 'd expect a kentucky moderate to be more right leaning than a deleware moderate also it 's worth mentioning andy is 2nd gen politician who was likely able to build support in kentucky as his father steve is a former gov as well do i think he could be good on the national stage in 4 years yeah he 's very much in the vein of clinton but again i really would assume he 's 100 % to the right of hillary bernie biden harris newsom pritzker and probably whitmer
beshear won a red state multiple times as governor as a 2nd generation politician his father was a two term gov too and seemingly a political force for kentucky dems for decades it 's a lot like manchin who 's also a second generation democrat in a red state
bernie 's gon na get hit with the old too plus the socialism stuff that newsom will drown in and to be honest his left leaning positions on israel palestine is gon na lose him some moderates and i say this as someone who voted for him in every primary i could man 's got a very short legislative history of things he sponsored
yeah really worked with hillary
just saying people said there would be a historic female vote in 2016 too and women failed to turn out for hillary
her interview after the debate with anderson cooper was so bad
eh maybe not then sounds like a good idea on paper though
you can not lose georgia senator
i mean him and booker are like the only two who could be options unless you are doing house reps which is very rare
yeah if two women on a ticket could n't win how 'bout we swap em out with a woman and a black guy neither of whom most of the country has even heard of with 17 weeks left until the election sure fire winner
one of the castro brothers
vote for biden is the only plan
misogyny is still too prevalent would be my guess
i did n't say anything about solely i 'm saying that it should n't even been a secondary objective focusing on that is why ginsberg refused to retire under obama despite being begged it was also what many people were focused on during hillary 's campaign we will get a president who happens to be a woman before we get a woman president
the issue for pritzker i think is i expect the dem convention to be a shitshow and if he 's the candidate he 's gon na get blamed for it since it 's in his state we already know palestinian supporters were planning on targeting it throw in a contested selection of a candidate the voters did n't pick unrest odds are high and it could look rough for him
yeah i suppose we should expect the american public to vote for a person that 99 999999 % of them have to google in order to know who the fuck he is
and i do nt care about a candidates age just if they are fit for the job and have good policies
he can still read a script but cognitive abilities slow down over time debate requires that you be quick witted fast and articulate none of which he can do on the fly anymore he is too old before you say trump was n't either he was to his base and to the undecideds we need a new guy woman
then he disobeys his faith
i 'm equally confident a vast majority of voters would n't care a lot of people are tired of both trump and biden so let 's show 'em someone new
trump gave her a lot of attention during his presidency i think that reminder of who she is would motivate a lot of general non trumpers who might otherwise not know her name
well you are definitely paying attention thanks for sharing
using primaries to determine the nominee is not required the party can choose one at the convention if the party decides they want to primaries really only started to matter in the ' 50s but really after 1968
ya it 's not hard to drum up a series of things showing him being a hypocrite or make him look bad like the dining rules during covid when he had his birthday at french laundry closing nearby counties cities but leaving his personal vineyards open in nearby counties show the pictures of sf before and after president xi visited sf and double hit him with homeless sold out to china anything pg e related are some of these a bit misleading not telling the full story sure can you make an ad and distill it so it 's close enough no one will care about the technicalities absolutely he 's probably the easiest politician i can think of in a while that you can paint as smarmy
and trump is even less fit since he 's a pathalogical liar a malignant narcissist putin 's puppet corrupt to the core and a sharting diaper wearing felon seriously did no one else hear him shitting his pants during one of his lies
i mean most non maga americans are at least sentient biden is barely alive but he ’s not actively threatening our way of life with an insane fascist overhaul of the government it ’s still a very easy choice for anyone who does n’t want to die in a horrific dictatorship led by the dumbest people in history
yes but that ’s not joe biden and unless he drops out and we get someone else the choice is between a bad speaker who is good at policy or trump who is a lying idiot who is easily manipulated but maybe speaks a little better still not great
hillary was being attacked since she was living in the white house as the first lady prior to fox news running the gop rush limbaugh was the one calling the shots and he would spend all day every day just attacking hillary clinton when she became a senator the attacks got even more serious as it was pretty obvious where she was headed the right wing hate machine had a quarter century to undermine clinton and she still pulled off the popular vote any new candidate that jumps in now will be savaged by the right wing media but there 's just not enough time for a new candidate to get clinton level baggage attached
hillary has been under scrutiny for 30 years you ca n’t make a boogeyman over night
they 'd been been trying to take her down since literally the early 90s lol
i actually thought she was solid but i do think my standards might have been lowered after watching trump and biden for 90 minutes
we need the same voters from 2020 to show up i think they will get on board with this more than biden and a ticket like that might keep the progressive wing from revolting but to your point we are into difficult choices here to use a sports analogy it ’s like being down double digits in a football game in the fourth quarter we do n’t have the luxury of running the ball
did we learn nothing from 2016 voters will just sit out or protest vote if you do n't give them a palatable candidate biden won in 2020 because he was good enough in their eyes back then he has clearly aged a lot since then and many of those voters just wo n't bother casting a ballot this time around give the voters a decent enough candidate and they will show up and reject trump once again
that 's not a victory plan biden was down in all swing state polls and behind nationally before he delivered the worst debate performance of all time
you 're kidding yourself at this stage if you think that 's still a victory plan
well in that case we are fucked
there is a savior angle that pritzker can take if it gets too violent brandon johnson the mayor of chicago is inexperienced and does n't seem to be working with pritzker if the convention goes well due to pritzker intervening maybe with the national guard it could cement his image as the adult in the room especially if it turns out to be a brokered convention
you do know that if a candidate is nominated they 'll be able to show themselves to the american people right sounds like west coast bubble bias
pundits right now are also saying biden performs better in front of a crowd which was missing last night i personally would also add a better make up artist because he looks 20 years younger today
and is yet another charlatan a “ good ” man kamala came out shilling
he ’s not a well liked politician within his own state let alone anywhere else
the people pushing him are the same people that were arguing for the past year that biden is completely fine so it 's not surprising it 's so frustrating that no one seems to see what you 're saying
i ’m not sure if you noticed but the other guy running is a convicted felon you famously fucked a porn star while married and has had numerous moments that make him look bad and like a hypocrite
she was the most popular politician in the country leading up to her run in 2016 the machine flipped that on its head overnight
whether or not you liked her answers to the questions she was at least able to remember the questions she was answering
you mean the same people that showed up in 2020 to vote for biden
people seem to forget that biden did not win by a large margin in 2020 no the popular vote does not matter when it 's the electoral college that determines the winner yet we keep getting told that he 's the best shot to beat trump because he 's done it before he barely did it before a stronger candidate could have beat trump easily
she got more votes people showed up for her more than him but whatever do n't change horses mid race all of this media discourse is to divide dem votersand get clicks and it 's working unfortunately with ease
i totally agree his win probability went from about 33 % before the debate to about 5 % now this is not panic talk anymore it ’s rational to conclude that someone else has a better chance
ya but presumably they would have made the decision before the convention the dnc is already going to be on the backfoot if they are replacing biden i just ca n't see them looking at all their options and taking that risk if he was a slam dunk you would but i do n't think he 's like tiers ahead of others to where you would risk that
yeah under four months 17 weeks sounds like long enough for that and to learn foreign policy sounds like midwest hayseed country mouse bias
when he was handed a softball abortion question he mumbled some nonsense story of a rapist immigrant for fucks sake he could not put coherent thoughts together in real time we need a new candidate asap we ca n't be running this guy after last night the damage is done though this was his chance to prove to america he was coherent enough to lead that 's all he had to do he failed no scripted speech will fix this damage we need whitmer or newsom
i would n’t say that i live in his state there are plenty of us that appreciate what he has done on certain aspects he has faced heat and stuck his neck out for certain causes other things we are like wtf but again politicians we are still the 4th or 5th we waffle largest economy in the world he continues to strengthen relationships many of the businesses that exited ca for other states are returning is he or we perfect no but we are a huge population huge wide sweeps of socioeconomic populism also we are quite red in many areas we are a tough nut and ca is a rough job he has done well
newsom also cheated on his wife at the time now interestingly enough donald trump jr 's wife with his secretary also the secretary was the wife of his campaign manager that 's worse than cheating with a porn star due to power dynamics yes it 's easy to make trump look like a pos and a hypocrite the problem is when you bring up trump 's behavior and are backing newsom even if people agree with your point they are like ya but you 're not really one to talk either trump wants to fight you in the mud everyone knows he 's shitty and he 's still pulling votes newsom gives off vibes of the corporate politician that 's been screwing everyone over for decades again these are easy ads to make come up with that also confirm california 's perception to the rust belt it 's not going to take much to slander a ca politician to that voting block especially if you are hitting them on homeless and catch them virtue signaling on rules for thee not for me like he did during covid
and she was the most hated at the same time by republicans
this he barely beat him before when trump was in the middle of fucking up the covid response and the economy was basically non existant it should have been a fucking landslide
if your horse collapses mid race and the other horse is running around in circles yeah you do change horses any of the other horses will do just get on one and finish the race
do n't change horses mid race the general election literally has not started yet it 's still primary season we just have n't taken it seriously until now
yes exactly the amount of copium among democrats right now is insane they want to waste time convincing themselves that they did n't see an insulting incoherent and frankly frightening performance from the presumptive democratic nominee and want to just blindly march off the cliff
i think the chances are low but anything can happen between now and then we are living in sigh unprecedented times
he 's a smart dude re foreign policy and the short time might actually be an asset too less baggage it 's also likely not going to happen but i am a big pritzker fan
you 're probably right but it 's still a risky move the election is 3 1 2 months away that 's not a lot of time for voters to get to know a new candidate for president the ideal time to swap him out was a year ago but that 's gone now
the horse did n't collapse do your duty and vote for a democrat in this two party system i do nt care who the a democrat is in this case its the current president i do n't need a debate to know which one sucks more but if you wanna get moralistic and believe you understand the system beyond that which i said be my guest at your own peril
they ’re coping with facts like trump lied a ton or trump is also old or “ you ’re voting for an administration ” i ’m telling y’ all you ’re not gon na win over the votes you need with that
worse is that now that biden had a better performance at a mostly scripted rally this afternoon they want to pretend like last night did n’t happen oh good we ’re going with a guy who is periodically coherent but is ok during daytime for small periods of time so basically somehow with the beginning stages of dementia who is sundowning and if he does n’t have dementia he might as well because it sure as hell looked like he did last night and optics are everything democrats seem to want to close their eyes and pretend there is n’t a problem right now we really are the fucking best at screwing up what should be easy elections
i think the best bet is biden being talked into stepping down i still put that under 30 % chance but i see no chance of him being forcibly replaced
fair enough could be a good asset for the democratic party for the future
i think it would look great if democrats pick a better candidate when it becomes clear that theirs is no longer mentally fit enough for the presidency prove that we do n't just double down like the republicans endlessly do for trump who is also mentally unfit for office on top of the whole dictatorship goal thing enthusiasm can only go up from where it is now biden only recently got slightly ahead in some polls post debate he will never be in the lead again the only person who could lose to a convicted felon is what we saw last night and biden will never be able to undo that i 'd argue it 's a guentreed loss if biden stays in and we can turn back time to two years ago he 's got ta step down
you 're preaching to the choir i 'm voting for biden if he 's on the ticket it 's not me or anyone else in these threads you need to convince it 's the disconnected voters who saw a corpse debate a psycho and do n't think it matters which one wins
if there were some obvious popular replacement standing in the wings i 'd agree but so far i 've seen gretchen witmer who and gavin newsom who 's sitting on a 46 billion deficit in california right now the best suggestion i 've seen so far is believe it or not is actually michelle obama name recognition likeable young smart and hip voters not on the politics subreddit of reddit 99 % wo n't care that she has no formal legislative experience trump did n't either
my dude this is history making news whoever it is will have the attention and warchest to drum up enough enthusiasm to beat the felon dictator who wants to end abortion the doj fbi doe etc anyone but a zombie who ca n't string an unwritten thought together in under 4 minutes can win this after the sotu i had hopes for him last night but no amount of damage control is going to fix this i do nt know if we should want it to frankly we should have higher standards than what we saw last night he is simply too old and obviously cognitivly declining we are n't maga no need to double down he 's also been losing in the polls until recently within the moe this whole time after this he wo n't be leading again whitmore would win this on abortion alone plus michigan is huge and would be a great bump i 'll still vote for biden if he stays but if stays he will lose in november
the ruling does not call into question prior cases that relied on the chevron doctrine roberts wrote no refunds on bribes
i ’ve been saying this for a while now but everything that ’s happening in this country can all be explained through the lens of money this is about money plain and simple 1%’ers and corporations have a lot of it they want more of it so they buy politicians and judges to remove the obstacles to making more money those pesky regulations that ’s profit for them just about any issue comes down to a powerful interest or group looking to extract as much wealth as possible at whatever cost necessary and it will our collective downfall truly as this system continues to degrade it will fail to serve more and more people as more and more of find ourselves without options and hope our politics will become more polarized and more extreme as the ends of the spectrum start to propose more radical solutions buckle up folks
in a phenomenal silver lining this puts the nail in the coffin for project 2025 ’s idea of “ schedule f ” completely allowing trump to overhaul the total government
i ca n’t wait for people like boebert and mtg to be looking at these incredibly complex regulations of topics they have no knowledge of and making decisions this will be fine just fine totally fine
regulations now have to be spelled out in legislation and guess who actually writes our legislation that 's right corporate lobbyists welcome to the new order i guess
so are we fucked forever or is there a way to combat this
congress would need to get their act together and pass legislation i would like to lose 40 pounds today and have winning lottery numbers i do n't think any of that is happening it feel like this decision and many others are just going to lead to corporations doing whatever they want without any consequences toxic waste in the river go ahead unbreathable air knock yourself out
it means the country is in the process of being bought and sold
it means that even if the pugs lose and project 2025 is not implemented in 2025 the supreme court and the republican party will still destroy our democracy one right at a time until pugs win the whitehouse but maybe if the dems win maybe we can get abortion and lgbtq rights back
what it means more luxury rvs more jet rides to exclusive island resorts yipeeee
this was all those bribes and illegal gifts paid too the united states supreme justice this the fruits it bared we the people are the ones who get screwed on this
how do we fix this the more we “ backslide ” the more i loose hope of peaceful means of change not advocating violence just genuinely concerned about future events
if america is so grotesquely corrupt but so comparatively uncorrupt on a world map of corruption recognition how on earth do the truly corrupt countries like african or certain asian countries look like because what america is doing right now looks exactly like what i imagine the most corrupt countries look like
that ’s assuming precedent matters which this court today showed that it does n’t
exactly this is a great decision for democracy and should be celebrated
where did you get the idea that they might do something anything unless you 're kidding because the point is that they have n't over decades and wo n't it 's up to 50 individual states to build infrastructures and spend the to defend themselves that 's the point
vote blue in the next election or die choking basically
even if congress where super active and willing to pass legislation this shit is still impossible making laws that say hey experts keep the air clean do that within these bounds but we are mostly lawyers and do n't know shit so be smart about it we will check in on you is completely acceptable in fact necessary or it was before today
pugs are adorable leave them out of this
america has backslid a lot since citizens united and that ’s accelerating due to this court in other words you ’re not imagining it
but is n't the decision already made what is voting blue going to do
i 'm bit confused about the decision the first such case that decided that money is free speech was buckley v valeo in 1976 its supporters say that citizens united was just about the right to do political advertising to be specific documentary about hillary clinton at any time before election in any case i refuse to believe that the founding fathers intended america to be oligarchy where only rich people have any say in the government and corruption does n't exist as a concept i hate those fascist hacks who claim that they only care about original intent
the supreme court only has it 's supreme power if 2 3 of congress and the president do n't stop them by passing an amendment either term limits for scotus and hoping they overturn the overturning or for protections on experts making regulations checks balances have n't worked in a long time and i 'm not placing bets on it happening but if 2 3 of congress could agree in the next couple terms to override the decision and a president agrees that overrides the decision alternatively the 2 conservative justices over the age of 70 are likely to retire if their seats can be taken by a younger conservative appointee outlasting their ability to retire peacefully would make the court 5 4 they overturned a previous decision it can happen again though it would be a massive uphill battle against the lower courts if congress could get its shit together long enough to expand the court it 'd be a possibility and has been done before and it only requires a simple majority in congress the president this should have been done 2 decades ago when this scotus overreach started getting exponentially worse and some justices with good legacies should have stepped down before death but this is where we are obviously if there is vague wording in the amendment the scotus could dispute those weak points and cut off large changes but this is the path without seat replacement
i imagine an end to gridlocked congress would allow them to pass bans on dangerous chemicals one by one instead of relying on the chevron decision
fix it and keep the sc from going 7 2 by march 2025
so there is a chance we can fix it
there 's going to have to be a massive shift for this 3 decade old blockade to subside i thought surely a global pandemic would light a fire one way or another but nope
vote blue vote blue vote blue vote for women
gross the radical evangelicals hav taken over the gop
gon na be lots of child support being paid
vote for women 's safety and trans folks now or watch it crumble after november period half the us is already in a fascist dystopia on a dem potus ' watch it 'll be far worse if the gop get a trifecta by then it 's now or never
vote blue vote for murdering babies
from who the radical evangelicals
a woman 's right to have say over her own body should be absolute period
i doubt you consume actual facts but infant mortality is up in tx since dobs was overturned
i m old enough to remember the party before the moral majority infiltrated
abbott is proud of himself for that btw proud of it imo
so 2000 when they put gay marriage on the ballot to get their supporters to the polls let me know how old you are so i can go earlier
way earlier how old are u moral majority infiltrated in 1979 you do the math lol
so nixons war on marijuana ie hippies will admit you got me you may just be older than me
no it was mostly reagan he used them to beat jimmy carter who himself was evangelical but they made carter look weak and emasculated him and then tried to immortalize reagan as a “ real man ” and a “ cowboy”and it worked after that the moral majority had its hooks in the party and they ve been riding it ever since the rise of gay rights in the 70s and aids in the 80s was their main scare tactic back then it was awful an absolutely terrifying time to be alive
there is a really great book on how the evangelical take over happened its called jesus and john wayne i recommend it to everyone
i was a child of the eighties and i remember being scared in the city that all crack addicts ie black men were willing to kill me for their next score i am ashamed to say they really got me with that one still have some racists tendencies it ’s been taking me 40 years to shake
i was a rural kid at that time as well heard all about how crazy it was in places like la and oakland the la riots made it even more real of course an epidemic of meth abuse and teen pregnancy was unfolding right in our little country town at the same time it ’s nearly always worse in small towns
to fold like a cheap suit when a few bigots spout off shows that they were n’t serious about the effort anyway
we pandered to try and get some cultural goodwill that we thought would make us money but then we got some pushback from an angry vocal minority so we 're abandoning it in the hopes that we can pander in some other way that will make us money this is just corporations being corporations
so rural people hate gays minorities people with disabilities and helping the environment they farm on true christian values right there folks
so they 're going to stop pretending to do nothing okay
should n't people in agriculture be the most interested and concerned people regarding climate change since it directly impacts their livelihood
that ’s their choice identically we as customers can choose where to shop
most of their clientele will be okay with it
the company added that it would “ stop sponsoring nonbusiness activities ” such as pride festivals or voting campaigns and no longer submit data to the human rights campaign the largest advocacy group for lgbtq rights in the u s on a related note my cats have declared their slave will no longer be allowed to purchase from tractor supply they have no appetite to deal with those who pander to bigoted douche hampers
well sure why would farmers care about climate change pffft
where will i get all my chinese crap from now
i hope there are mom pop feed stores nearby for other people to take their business elsewhere
america ’s heartland has always been a bigoted dumpster fire filled with lazy garbage people that anyone was trying to bring civility to those hateful and cruel knuckle draggers was doomed to fail
just like anheuser busch found out the hard way they lost far more due to these efforts than they 're going to lose from the few members of the house of hate throwing a temper tantrum over these companies finally abandoning their discriminatory policies i 'm betting this is just the tip of the iceberg too
welp that sucks they are the only ones that stock a bunch of shit i use guess i ’ll have to stock up and order online instead ordering t posts is going to be such a pain
boeing went full dei and planes started falling out of the sky i applaud tractor supply for knowing their customers
such a disgusting company full of racist sycophants who would n't know morality if it bit them in the ass
speaking with your wallets works
american farmers support democratic ideals tsc failed
dei sure but too bad on climate stuff
lets boycott tsc use more expensive implements or go to lowes menards or home depot two of which were dei long before dei was a thing
obama 's presidential election win broke many of them i can only speak of my experience in rural arkansas i 'm a white male in my 40 's and have had strangers start conversations off with racial slurs and hate speech often since 2007 i 'm far left of the democratic party and know that if i am open with my political beliefs or speak out against hateful rhetoric it could cause harm professionally and lead to conflict many red states continue to have lower voter turnout as well i 'm voting blue all the way down the ballot in every state and national election but can see where similarly minded voters may opt to not vote at all one thing democrats and leftists need to do better is to not immediately generalize entire states or other demographics based solely on election results we need to embolden those that disagree with conservative ideology to actively participate in the democratic process even if they reside in red states or live in rural areas just my two cents vote blue
no really the government insures farms if the crops fail they still get paid
i do n't know which stores do and do n't have dei programs i 'm sure no one will notice
my cats told me the same thing
do n't worry you can start with the device you typed this on
sadly 2016 kind of reinforces some of that 62 % to 81 % voted for putinjrtrump 61 % of the military not saying yet scary i was shocked disgusted still making me feel lied to about rural areas in america good grief liz chaney was voted out chaney in wyoming
man if menards is our standard for hardware store with values we are truly fucked
seriously even in deep red states the landslide wins are often a difference of less than 10 %
in rural areas you do n't have much dei to work with to be honest
but it is enough for the democratic party to spend zero to little dollars on election efforts in most red states
that 's going to be nearly impossible since the supreme court just gave carte blanc to corporate polluters
unless there is a law passed by congress specifically defining the safe limits of pfas in water no one has to do anything thanks scotus
you ca n't teflon is in everything it 's too late
cost really should n't be an issue for such things and make companies that produce use them take on the cost
it wo n’t be cheap so it wo n’t be done
it 's something that has to happen
what will be really expensive is ruining our water supplies we ’re really good at it and it may not be a bill we ’re capable of paying once it comes due
teflon is in everything and everyone
you 'll never get your hands on my teflon toilet bowl cleaner s
i thought she did about as well as she could ’ve on cnn last night
instead of astroturfing and trying gaslight us all into not believing what we witnessed firsthand this should have just been a video of her doing pushups like really knocking them out or sprinting doing laps a party that is as delusional as the maga folks on the right will not win new first time or otherwise undecided voters and this race will go down to the wire and very likely trump wins if biden 's vanity and ego require a 2nd term i think it 'll only be possible if a new unheard before trump scandal pops up at the 11th hour
well yeah she is fighting for her job after all
if i were in charge of the dnc i would do whatever it takes to get a solid candidate on the ticket like whitmer i do n't know what damage trump would cause in a second term but it would be devastating to the country to the point where i ca n't guarantee we 'd have a democracy by 2028 running biden puts the country in grave danger
at least they 're trying to stem the bleeding at least
someone wants to be the 1st female president
i opened a position bet when biden harris won the election at 1200 1 that biden would be a 1 term president and harris would be the dems candidate when biden drops out 500 x 1200 harris will replace biden and rinse the orange rapist
i 'm really surprised she did n't say what can be unburdened by what has been
oh yeah that s going to help
she 's really not helping his chances he 'd do better with someone else as vp
harris holding on to her meal ticket
trump ca n't be defeated by scandals as 34 felonies barely put a dent in his polling numbers the only way to beat trump is big dem turnout if we pull that off trump is finished
should of this is where i stopped reading
biden should have chosen whitmer to begin with and stuck to a single term things would look so much better right now edit actually he should have resigned halfway through his term and give whitmer the opportunity to be president for ten years it would be fun watching alito and thomas trying to outlast that
the impression biden left me with is if he is elected president she will be
you just wasted 500 bucks
“ as long as there are those that remember what was there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be ”
a conviction is a bit higher than just a scandal
something about a light and a way
in trump 's world it is another day at the office
trump is n't even that hard to beat with his poor favorability rating and countless lies and scandals replacing biden with whitmer will make trump go from around a 65 % chance of winning to 5 % or lower
she 's not really dead if we find a way to remember her
they are going for obergefell next everyone
mark your calendars boys this is the first domino in an effort to overturn obergefell
and all king greg has to do is say border border border i love maiming people at the border and also clothes with flamethrowers of migrants we 're securing and stepping it up gaslight to force even rural republicans to acquiesce and get primaried or be gone from office by force etc like school vouchers the gop loves the border immigration issue as much as dems love dobbs roe for good reason sadly
like the mullahs in iran we now have robe clad theocrats with absolute power
bigotry facilitated by legally recognized religious privilege which overrides equal protection under the law nice that ’ll have positive outcomes on society
if your religious views get in the way of interpreting the law then you should n't be a judge
typical tyrant right wing scumbag marriage what her view is and nobody else
that 's actually kind of legally complicated i think based on the law the courts are obligated to make the marriage happen but i 'm not sure if it 's legal to force a specific judge to do it
i was ready to be outraged but this sounds like a plausible argument if true because officiating weddings is not one of hensley 's required duties as justice of the peace how she chooses to perform that duty is not necessarily a reflection of how she carries out her responsibilities on the stand
no precident law is safe you think its safe nope already taken away i 'll take the not felon convict running still
yup just watch gregory 's gilead for the national gop plan if they get a trifecta this nov in 2025 they will try to implement as much as humanly possible texas is the leader of the gop state not even cousin defuhrer florida always has been always will be so long as its electoral prize is the greatest gop hq
it would come down to roberts because gorsuch would side with the liberal justices on that fight it 's kind of hard to say which way roberts would go kavanaugh also a little bit of a wild card on this specific topic
standing that her 1st amendment rights might have been violated not sure how that ca n’t be proven in a court of law she was reprimanded for her religious stance there was no findings on the facts or the law just granting standing
the republicans are going to make a big mistake
those voters are only caring about themselves not their kids not their friends no one
yeah no big deal just have to shop for the right judge to approve who you marry
that ’s what we ’re going to find out in this lawsuit
i posted this earlier without the correct title and someone dismissively was like “ this is the texas supreme court ” as if they are n’t setting this one up to be challenged by the supreme court this is how we are governed now
with republican support for gay marriage in the 40 % range i think this will only help them with their base the groomer shit really did a number
tell that to women and the gay community and non christians in places like la
of course that 's their goal you 're dead right how much dems win this nov or how little determines how much if any of the fascist agenda can get implemented fast hard period
provide any evidence of theocratic power judges ruling with absolute power this case has n’t even been decided at all i ’m sure iran or hamas would love an opportunity to show you the difference
it 's clear that scotus is really all they need with willing autocrats in a supermajority of the supreme court they do n't even need trump to win all they have to do is hang on to a 50 50 senate so that they can rebuff any attempts to alter the makeup of the court
they 're most likely to win the senate this year if any chamber by far imo there 's nowhere flippable and a lot of states vulnerable worried about tester brown the most least worried about rosen baldwin gallego holding that seat so far biden 's re election odds are better than a dem senate period and most likely is dems get the house back but none of this triad is looking likely right now that said there 's enough time for it to still change of course
i seem to remember chik fil a donating to christian groups that lobbied african governments to pass anti gay laws certainly this situation in uganda has absolutely nothing to do with that s
the fellowship foundation while based in the u s has been cozy with anti lgbtq african leaders for years but there is particular concern about its work in uganda “ since the passage of first anti homosexuality act a decade ago there have been numerous reports linking both bills their authors and the larger movement to further criminalize lgbtqi people in uganda to the fellowship foundation the family and its associates fuck the fellowship foundation the family they should all be in jail till they rot
cut to 4 months and his base probably will be crying about how “ he and his wife are oppressed christians because they ca n’t conceive and ivf is too hard to obtain ”
rep matt rosendale r mn is exiting congress this year after two terms in office and being told “ no thanks ” by the gop ’s senate campaign arm when he considered running for the senate but before he leaves congress he has apparently decided to complain about in vitro fertilization ivf a conception method used by many queer couples to have kids republicans have increasingly threatened to ban it because they see the discarding of fertilized embryos as murder “ if you believe that life begins at conception as i do there is no difference between an abortion and the destruction of an ivf embryo ” one poster quotes rosendale as saying attacking lgbtq rights has been a big part of rosendale ’s short history in congress he added an amendment to the annual national defense authorization act in an attempt to ban gender affirming care for veterans in defending that bill he argued that trans people do n’t know if “ they are a man or a woman ” and therefore are prone to launching “ icbm missiles ” on everyone went after the veterans administration for flying the pride flag this june a letter to department of veterans affairs chief dennis mcdonough in may described displaying the pride flag at va facilities as “ woke identity politics ” and complained that “ flying this flag puts one group of veterans above the rest ” it 's really getting harder to tell the difference between the gop and the taliban it 's almost like a mirror at this point
he seems like a very pleasant man insert dripping sarcasm meme
where do people learn to be this hateful
this guy is a looney toon who does n't respect other people 's rights why is he attacking ivf let guess part of the christian taliban
it must be exhausting to always be so angry
so he ’s mad sad that he could have just come out as gay and still have kids so now he wants to take it away from everyone cuz he ’s a miserable turd because baby jesus cares about what you do and watches you in the bedroom bathroom shower or is he just confused about people existing differently than him
he ’s extremely confused on how queer people have kids hint it usually does not involve ivf
today u s transportation secretary pete buttigieg announced 1 8 billion in awards from the rebuilding american infrastructure with sustainability and equity raise discretionary grant program for 148 projects across the country today ’s announcement brings the total amount of biden harris administration raise grants to more than 7 2 billion for over 550 projects across the country “ after decades of underinvestment the condition of america ’s infrastructure is now finally getting better instead of worse and today we proudly announce our support for 148 more projects in communities of every size across the country ” said u s transportation secretary pete buttigieg “ through president biden ’s bipartisan infrastructure law we ’re funding projects across the country to make roads safer make it easier for people to move around their community make transportation infrastructure more resilient to extreme weather and improve supply chains to keep costs down for consumers ” the competitive and popular raise program which was authorized 1 5 billion a year on top of already appropriated funds thanks to president biden ’s bipartisan infrastructure law supports a diverse slate of communities with projects of local and regional significance funding is split equally between urban and rural areas and a large percentage of grants support regions defined as historically disadvantaged or areas of persistent poverty the eligibility requirements of raise allow project sponsors including state and local governments counties tribal governments transit agencies and port authorities to pursue multi modal and multi jurisdictional projects that are more difficult to fund through other grant programs raise discretionary grants invest in critical freight and passenger transportation infrastructure projects that would otherwise not receive the funding needed if not for president biden ’s bipartisan infrastructure law raise is a keystone program of president biden ’s investing in america agenda rebuilding and repairing critical infrastructure using american made materials and spurring historic levels of private sector investment in regions around the country investing in key transportation infrastructure initiatives through programs like raise is growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up lowering costs for families and creating good paying union jobs for american workers in their home communities partial list of projects are included in the press release but the full list of projects can be found here you can also check out for an interactive map of ongoing projects
yeah but he had a bad debate so let ’s keep upping the orange psychopath
and yet people here are convinced biden is a terrible president and needs to step down
i do n’t know but it seems foolish to invest a dime in red states given their drive to destroy the country we could apply the same logic republicans in those states use to deny free lunches to school kids they might get used to eating
they better push these projects out a little faster because in 5 months it 's goodnight irene for the biden harris administration
silver lining to biden having the worst debate of all time we might finally get student loan forgiveness
people care more about words than actions that 's the internet in a nutshell
terrible candidate not president he wo n't get a second term as a president based on last night 's performance as upsetting as that is that is the situation we 're now in
red states are still part of the country and their people deserve good lives as much as anyone else
you already know all these big projects are set super far out and are just for clout today “ by 2040 ” “ by 2350 ” long past the point where they have any responsibility over the project it ’s a joke when they do that which prior plan was ever on schedule and on time
supreme court actually just made that a lot harder department of education may have to start deferring to the court for every little thing now
they care about their perception and the general consensus of peoples perception is that biden came off as old and weary sucks but is what it is
i 'm going to vote for a president not a candidate
i mean if we ’ve learned anything about debate performances and election results from the past few decades it ’s that debates do n’t matter
while they deny good lives to both blue states and non republicans in their own state help me understand that
this was n't a debate this was a disaster
that one dude should have pulled the fire alarm
i still think this was really a poor debate strategy by the biden camp combined with a cold or something causing him to be hoarse i mean yes he 's old he 's not as quick as he used to be but if you saw him last night talking to the crowd at the watch party or waffle house and then again today he seemed fine and largely in line with what people expected to see i think the problem is the campaign seemed to want him to fact check trump in real time with numbers and detail that 's not who joe has ever been they should have let him attack trump call him a liar point out one or two falsehoods and move on you saw glimpses of that with morals of an alley cat quip but most of the night he was too forced and robotic trying to refute dozens of lies it was a terrible tactic and we 'll see how much damage was done
there ’s a lot of talk on social media about the people in charge of the dnc choosing or sticking with biden who exactly are these people who determine who represents the democratic party
crazy how he gives one of his best speeches the very next day who ever prepped him for that debate needs to be fired immediately
not a citizen so my opinion does n't count but i watched the entire thing last night biden was the only one who made any attempt whatsoever to actually answer the questions asked and then we have trump spouting utter nonsense like post birth abortion refusing to answer the january 6 question and not even saying he 'll accept the verdict of this election if i were voting i would any day vote for someone who 's a bit slow in some set ups over a person who might not even accept election results the job is being an administrator not a professional showman or debater everyone declaring that trump won are treating this like an elocution contest loudest shouting contest how can trump win this if he did n't even answer most of the questions answered half the questions with millions of people are crossing the border
i know i ’m not a young man i do n’t walk as easily as i used to i do n’t talk as smoothly as i used to i do n’t debate as well as i used to but i know what i do know i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong and i know how to do this job i know how to get things done and i know what millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up ” well said but i do n't know what to say a dog is better than trump for me but a party needs to show real sacrifices to save democracy when necessary if they want to persuade swing voters that they are the saver of democracy
when trump wins it 's his fault
please joe for the sake of the country step aside we can still win against the autocrat if we find a replacement now
i love how all his aides and staff have been lying saying how quick witted and energetic he is behind closed doors because they do n’t want to lose their meal ticket and have him replaced with someone who is n't a walking corpse
president joe biden ’s campaign insisted friday he will not drop out of the 2024 race but fractures between those in the president ’s orbit insisting on trudging forward and the broader democratic world seeking a last minute change were growing after biden ’s disastrous debate performance biden while giving a much more animated speech in north carolina on friday saying “ i know i ’m not a young man i do n’t walk as easily as i used to i do n’t talk as smoothly as i used to i do n’t debate as well as i used to but i know what i do know i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong and i know how to do this job i know how to get things done and i know what millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up from the west wing to wilmington biden advisers spent friday morning calling democratic members of congress donors and other key supporters in hopes of allaying some of the widespread panic about the debate with former president donald trump on cnn thursday night biden ’s performance rife with a raspy voice an often mouth agape facial expression and one painful moment in which the president lost his train of thought and suddenly stopped speaking laid bare the potential political costs of nominating the oldest ever president for a second term asked whether biden would exit the race biden campaign spokesperson seth schuster responded “ no ”
pretty sure the only reason there are ' democratic questions ' at all is because halfway through the debate the us and uk media launched an all out assassination attempt against biden while once again launching softballs and ignoring a stream of despicable lies from ttump name names which ' top dems ' were calling for him to step down an hour into the debate hmm could it be axelrod the go to biden enemy 2 3 of our audience of handpicked morons and trumpers think trump won really cnn tell me more this is a trap a blatant attempt to sow chaos among democrats do not fall for it
why not he 's this invested into and he could still easily beat trump in the polls the democratic elites stuck us with biden now they are getting cold feet about him and the only people who will pay for this are the democratic constituents who stood by biden in hopes of defeating trump
there are no questions he ’s running
i know this is pretty clearly copium but maybe bombing the debate was intentional it gets people a little panicked and motivated for the last month i ’ve had one door knocker every week or two i had three just today
haha jamal bowman he just got beat in his primary he ’s outtie 5000 in january
and biden should be replaced by someone competent
it was a definite miscalculation any democratic voter would have and still will vote for him if he 's on the ballot in november the average swing voter does n't care about facts and statistics otherwise they would n't be a swing voter to begin with it 's all about the vibe the rhetoric and being quick and clever on your feet at these debates and all those checkboxes were sorely missed last night
yeah there ’s plenty of them who could have squared up realtime like gavin newsom or pete buttigeig i feel everyone forgets trump ’s one strength making a living grifting and peddling nonsense on television while looking strong cool calm and to a certain extent of potential voters coherent
it ’s baffling then trumps not a surprise
who exactly are these people who determine who represents the democratic party i 've always thought that was done by voters in the primaries
the blame is solely on biden not some unnamed advisors
how do you even prep a demented man
the reality is that most people care more about how a candidate presents him herself than about the substance it ’s all about the narrative so even if he lies with every sentence trump just needs to sound like he knows what he ’s talking about if the content actually mattered he would n’t have even 1 10th of the support he currently has
you 'd think the people willing to vote for a twice impeached convicted felon and a pathological liar with a rich history of lying directly to their faces would somehow be responsible as well
even cnn and msnbc pundits who have been lying about biden seemed to throw up their hands after the debate and say “ ok biden we ca n’t cover for you anymore this is all out in the open ”
i like this response for people saying he should drop out who else can beat trump in your opinion
he should be replaced with whitmer or newsom he ’s an embarrassment and disgrace and his ego is going to cost us the next election sit the fuck down old man
did you watch the debate it was an all time bad performance from joe
i think people are confusing debate performance with ability to be president i do n't see any reason for him to give up the office he just did n't underperform on that level and i honestly worry about people 's metrics for evaluating a pres if they think this justifies that type of extreme action should a serious discussion happen about possible replacements on the ticket yes would it automatically be wrong for the final outcome to be sticking with biden no he really might be the best chance but the questions should be asked
there are no questions he 's losing
if he intentionally lost that would be even more concerning so i doubt that ’s the case
right he ’s got nothing to lose now
yea fortunately for biden and what most of the punditry is missing today is most of those people are in the group that start paying attention in september
trump also just spewed campaign speech lines that he 's used 100 times before it 's second nature at this point biden was trying to recall facts and figures while constructing coherent rebuttals on the fly and it just did not work not in theory and definitely not in execution gavin and pete are smooth talkers and know how to craft a fact based yet understandable line biden is n't that guy these days they needed simple talking points and 5 10 bullet points he could hammer while calling out trump for not answering questions or deflecting back to immigration
sure but they 're different people that 's my point that has never been biden even in his prime so why try to be something different
it is not or else this walking corpse would be in a retirement community enjoying his last years of sunsets
100 % his fault and i would n't be mad if he was replaced weird to go from completely senile one day to a coherent powerful performance like 12 hours later it looked like he had been kept up all night rehearsing too many coached talking points or maybe 9 pm is just too late for him lol
moderators did a terrible job like trying to overcome a bias officiating crew in a sport
you find out how they prepped diaper don
true i would be delusional if i did n't acknowledge this reality
you 'd think the other major political party would have spent the previous four years grooming someone anyone capable of defeating him with one hand tied behind his her back the shallowness of the democratic talent pool right now is just sad
you'ld think the democrats would prioritise running a candidate who could compete with that
literally anyone who can string a sentence together whitmer pritzker shapiro polis cooper newsom etc
there are literally 300 million other americans to choose from do we need to have a talk about all the things the dnc has been doing to prevent primaries from happening
you think biden can beat trump while looking demented like this
that 's a little hit of hopium i needed right now thank you
yea and that was my point biden was never that guy he was always best speaking plainly to people expecting him to spit out endless facts and policy points is not playing to his strengths
i 'll 100 % be voting for this walking corpse over the guy who has been adjudicated to be a sexual abuser defamer fraudster and felonious election interferer
could n't have been too late he looked much better talking to the democratic watch party literally minutes after the debate ended really one of the strangest series of events i can remember on a campaign
or maybe 9 pm is just too late for him lol hopefully other countries respect his bedtime
they messed up his dosages
diaper don is a lying fascist but he sounds coherent to his fans so i doubt his performance yesterday is gon na lose him any votes biden on the other hand
i 'm sorry but i do n't think i could convince nearly as many people to vote for me as biden can
i think trump is going to win and have thought that for a long time he tried to overthrow the government and basically nothing happened to him he is way too powerful he has tapped into some dangerous forces here i also believe biden has the best chance to win the election other than trump
you might but undecided voters might not vote for him they might just stay home replacing biden can only help
the presidency is a 24 hour job
have you tried not letting anyone else in your party run against you
climate change is a chinese hoax donald trump i try not to run the engine too much on my yacht also trump in like the 80s can you say sociopath
that is the point kind of biden originally was one of many potential candidates he is the one the dnc lined up behind for a reason and ultimately went on to win the presidency could have been any of these figureheads but he was the best for the job i do n't know who else would be better rn
he won the presidency by an ass hair because trump 's handling of the pandemic annoyed bearly enough rightfully disaffected americans to leave the house in november on the promise that biden would only serve one term after four years of rail strikes student loan fuckery inflation housing crisis g nocide there is no ass hair on earth that will save us he drops out now or we 're all fucked and when he does n't guess who will get blamed him and his stupid shit ride or die supporters who drove us off this cliff
the we beat medicare moment was frightening
there should be some level of panic dems need a fire under their asses we ca n’t let this stand
only way he can do that is to come out and do multiple long uninterrupted speeches that make him appear normal if that was a fever that messed him up bad then this should n’t be an issue in the next week or two to begin doing
sometimes trying to tame panic can have the adverse effect
what i learned from the last few months is that biden and trump are very old and that biden sleeps at night and trump sleeps during the day
shocker they ’re trying to circle the wagons do n’t let them trump will beat biden and we ca n’t afford that
problem is you ca n’t rely on teleprompters all the time anyone can fake sharpness and alertness when you are literally being fed the words and emphasis you are supposed to use debate biden without teleprompters and nothing but his own mind is the real biden and it is a scary thought that we ’ll get trump elected because democrat enablers and yes men would n’t allow for a different candidate
he needs to immediately step away from the campaign democracy is on the line and after seeing joe not being able to put together coherent thoughts i do n't want to put the fate of it in his hands
wow this rally energy proves that when he is reading from a speech writer he is ok but the debate was the real biden without someone else 's words i 'm watching the liberal news and they do n't see that it 's a speech writer and he 's just reading
he 's not going to be able to the panic is wide ranging and well deserved there wo n't be another debate till september and by then the gap between him and trump may become insurmountable biden deciding to stick in the race now is the same type of hubris we got with rbg putting your own pride and ambition over what 's good for the country
biden was tired and maybe not on his best game but he was at least answering the questions and speaking facts trump did n't answer a single fucking question and did nothing but disrespect biden and blame everyone else for his failures
sounds much better today wish he did this last night
joe the only way to tame panic is to step aside and allow the party to choose a young popular capable democrat to lead the ticket anything else is just feeding your own ego
he just came out saying i do n't debate as well as i used to and that is the worst thing he could have said to calm anyone
what happened to his cold
charlottesville has been a debunked hoax why are dems not seizing that false statement
step down bring is someone in their 50 's or 60 's with a reasonable set of policies that will call trump on his bs i know far too much to ask
everyone needs to treat this moment with lucidity and stop acting like this is a candidate that can win in november
you know what would have tamed our panic if the president had drink some espresso before the debate and did n’t stare into the camera like a hollowed husk of a human
friday sought to tamp down the panic among some democrats over his ability to lead the party heading into november following a calamitous debate performance a night earlier delivering a more energized speech in north carolina in which he acknowledged some of his shortcomings “ folks i do n’t walk as easy as i used to i do n’t speak as smoothly as i used to i do n’t debate as well as i used to ” biden said at a campaign rally in raleigh
i ’m going to go out on a limb and suggest that the way that debate went will have an indecipherable impact on votes my belief that 99 9 % of those who will vote in this election knew long ago who they will vote for and nothing can change that
trump is a babbling rambling idiot i have no idea how people can defend his drivel
i do n't get why the fuck they ca n't put newsom in there he is already campaigning for biden and doing a better job at it as well
peoples attention spans are short in week or two something new will happen and the debate will be forgotten
americans forget that americans have an attention span of about a week which is not surprising considering our lack of long term memory this will be forgotten by this time next week
it seems like he does better when he is in or with a crowd there appears to be no such issues like there was at the debate
buch of cry babies here
only hope is to circle the wagons these gop fuckers support a convicted rapist fraudster convicted felon without qualms no such thing as a never trumper gop falls in line
he did fine he 's getting older and probably not a night owl and it 's june not september so the only people really paying attention are the die hards
he was right though he killed the conversation around m4a and we have n't heard a peep about his single payer health care plan either
they turned off his mic and he could nt correct himself biden does n't keep talking once his mic is off it happend last debates too he 's too polite to keep talking now is that to say it would have been better to let him salvage what he was saying i do nt know but ending it right there was because his light turned off and he stopped talking not because his sentence actually ended there
not speeches but interviews with multiple news organizations including those who do n’t like him i think replacing is the better option but if you take this route you have to show biden acting on his feet
should n’t be an issue in the next week or two i do n’t mean to offend in any way but that ’s delusional last night was the worst debate i ’ve ever seen trump may have lied through his teeth the entire time but what the average american will remember is biden looking and acting like a confused old man it ’s reprehensible that the dnc is propping biden up as the presidential candidate after what we saw it lends credence to all the rumors about biden barely being there mentally in meetings the national narrative right now is biden is not fit to be president for 4 more years with his current cognitive issues the 2024 election is ostensibly over unless biden is replaced it ’s infuriating
he ’s done that several times over the last few months the problem is the media does n’t pay attention to biden gives a good speech on foreign policy
he 's doing a good job in n c right now
what would the alternative be continuing on with the whole we did well thing pretending it never happened i think he had to address it and this was n't a bad attempt
vampire or zombie who you gon na pick
you do n't need a teleprompter when you just say whatever comes into your head and do n't care if its true or not
he needs to resign the presidency at this point
right is no one seeing an issue with yes at the rally he is better because he is reading off a prompter watch it on cspan the whole thing there is a teleprompter where he is reading a pre written speech anyone is going to sound better reading a well thought out speech over novel off the cuff answers also are we going to ignore his body language at the rally when jill was speaking he was standing there with his mouth open looking clearly in mental decline the way he stands when he ’s waiting for his turn to speak is concerning
biden can not afford to be “ tired ” last night my greatest fear is that actually was his best game he tried to answer questions and speak facts but he had a terrible time communicating at all i am a lifelong democrat but just trying to be real
that ’s a rational response that is n’t how the people who will decide the election will think
yeah but being a president is a 24 7 job
teleprompter with favorable crowd he ca n’t think on his feet and will lose in november
cool so he 's fine now where the stakes do n't matter he only fucked up on the biggest and most important stage maybe of this election cycle nbd
why he was honest and he showed humility and competence the crowd loved it
the rest of the quote left out of that second paragraph “ but i know what i do know ” he continued “ i know how to tell the truth i know right from wrong and i know how to do this job i know how to get things done and i know what millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up ”
how is that reassuring that 's just telling people i 'm getting too old and slow for this job man we are so fucked
unfortunately that 's not a great campaign message
if your campaign message is “ do n’t worry guys i ca n’t function in most areas but i ’m still not trump ” then you are going to lose this is n’t going to help
it was like 32 minutes of a rally his wife made opening remarks followed by another person he did n’t start to speak until 10 minutes in even then was reading off a script this is not a good look the rally did n’t look a whole lot better when his wife was talking same issue staring off looking too old for the job
yeah we know now sit down before you fall down and let someone else drive
agree his body may be weak but he was sharp as ever unfortunately no one saw that
it will affect turnout and it will make more people irrationally consider rfk last couple presidential elections have come down to small margins in swing states 30 40 000 people staying home on election day or giving their votes to rfk is all it would take to throw the election to trump
newsom is a terrible candidate and would not perform well nationally
probably because newsom may be against it it would be a rushed campaign and if he loses it would likely ruin any chance he has to be president in the future i 'd guess he wants to wait until 2028 if he does decide to run to have a full campaign
newsom would be trounced in nv and az it would n't even be close
newsom has the california stigma around him that 's not going to win over all democrats or even independents
california has a very problematic reputation for an aspiring president it could be very difficult to get newsom elected even though he 's a very smart man
if it was just one little misspeak or gaffe then yes biden ’s had tons of them through the years but that was something completely different people are n’t going to forget that
horseshit bush checking his watch still gets relived every 2 years this was the worst televised debate performance by a sitting president ever and that will be a record not easily broken if the trump campaign does n't try to keep this in people 's minds everyday until november it would be outright negligent of the campaign and that 's coming from a hardcore liberal socialist
biden was losing virtually every swing state before this debate nominate biden if you want but he will lose and trump will return
no they wo n't biden is n't getting younger and this was n't just a bad night he will be under a microscope even more it would silly to think he wo n't slip again in the next 4 months this has made everyones fears come true and gives the perfect fire power to the gop
zero chance of that it ’s not as if he made a minor gaffe he was incoherent and confused for the better part of 90 minutes
this might be one thing if before the debate he was n't already down in the polls with a historically low approval rating put yourself in undecided voters shoes who watched that debate would you think that if you voted for joe you were actually voting for him to make decisions or it would be a weekend at bernie 's situation where it would be the people around him doing it
that s bad because the same lights of deep scrutiny that biden failed to pass last night will be all the more brighter in october
it ’s not the debate it ’s biden in general people went from “ biden ’s not that bad ” to “ i ca n’t believe these are our choices ” we are going to have record low turnout out this year because the dnc is so selfish
that ’s weird the left has been asking biden for a ceasefire for 7 months that seems a little longer than 2 weeks so weird right
yep they will flip out again on the next debate then come election day they will have to make their decision personally i do n’t see biden losing but hey that ’s me
saying biden did “ fine ” has to be the most delusional take about the debate so far
assuming he does n’t step aside his convention acceptance speech will be as important as ever now i ’m willing to give him a pass for last night if he can show in future speeches that he clearly was just running a fever but last night was depressing as hell for hope of maintaining a democracy after the upcoming election
denial ai n't just a river
ah shit being reminded of that is like twisting the dagger in this whole lesser of the two evils thing the state of things here really is a mess is n't it
that ’s because democrats do n’t have control over congress
biden ’s people wanted the mics controlled so while that may be true it ’s still his handlers faux pas
yet if he goes on and shits the bed he 's just burying himself deeper frankly i do nt think it even matters if he goes on people that are n't going to vote for him ca nt be reconvinced at this point
nobody wants to hear this reality i pointed out that we all need to start talking about what to do when trump gets back in and he and his magas bring about fascism
people fear trump more than worry about biden 's cognitive abilities which still far exceed trump 's and biden does n't lie keep watching biden is going to slaughter trump
if having biden speak more is the only way to quell fears about his capacity then methinks there ’s a catch 22 afoot
because good performances reading a prompter mean nothing my grandmother is diagnosed with dementia and she can read a long note out loud fine she just ca n't remember it 5 minutes later presidents have had bad debates before none of it looked like this because an adult in their prime ca n't be disabled this way by anything except the news their partner child just died this was totally out of bounds for the minimum acceptable effort for a president and not even 100 flawless teleprompter speeches can change that
i once sang phantom of the opera with a dementia patient having her read the lyrics left the rest of the staff in awe she probably had no idea what she was saying or doing though
drop out gracefully we saw what we saw there is no spin time to go joe
drop out we have pritzker and newsom that could clean the floor with trump biden is embarrassing me
zombie if i have too
which would have been easy to refute and fact check in real time by a candidate who was in full control of their mental faculties
the hill leaving out something that would make biden look better why i never
“ sharp as ever ” jesus christ what debate did you watch
good thing trump respects and wants to preserve democratic traditions then oh wait and there are apparently some supreme court judges who are getting kind of old and want to retire in luxury with their hard earned gifts and that can then conveniently be replaced with like 30 40 year old ideological nutcases that will fuck the country for decades
what 's wrong with california is n't it literally the most successful state by almost any metric
obvious choice is g whitmer she had to run against a maga and that debate was a masterclass in countering lies and falsehoods
yeah it ’s given us classics like nixon and reagan why ca n’t ca give us a democrat
i gasped when i merely saw biden at the beginning of the debate then it went downhill i wish i could forget
ceasefire from what the iraq war when politicos mention voters ’ short attention spans or “ memory of a goldfish ” we ’re not talking about us we mean normal people they ’re clueless i did n’t like watching that debate so i ’ve decided to be more like them i ’m voting for biden cos he caught bin laden supports drug legalization and has always fought hard for labor unions anyway it ’s his turn to be president since he lost last time and things are n’t going so well nothing will change my mind
the risk is far to great keeping biden is worse then the alternative
i saw a post that claimed biden “ gutted ” trump
he can calm it by stepping down
are you under the impression all democrats want healthcare reform because they certainly do n't the progressives do but you also have your blue dog dems like gottheimer who are fighting against even negotiating drug prices regardless biden is the de facto leader of the democrats and does n't fight hard enough for these issues that would benefit all americans negotiating prices for a few drugs covered by medicare and lowering insulin prices prices that are still way higher than elsewhere around the world is nice but does n't meet the needs of the moment
sure but it 's a non story in that it was a disastrous response if trump had written covfefe and then corrected it to coffee it 's a non story doubling down on not making an error was the issue
this is the major issue i keep seeing these polls of “ debate did n’t change voters minds despite biden bad performance ” the problem is n’t voters switching so much as them staying home good luck replicating 81 million votes with biden round 2
he answered questions about unrelated trade deals and complex foreign policy issues
i d give him a few weeks to see how the polling bares out before that but yeah if he collapses he has to do it
yeah nothing like trading an obvious problem for a slew of new and unprecedented ones
obama had a bad debate in 2012 and they said the same thing about him biden will win against the fascist
he did fact check him that was part of the problem biden rolled off a bunch of facts badly when just energetically asserting that it was all obvious bullshit would 've been better trump lies all the time shamelessly he lies about things so obviously that you do n't need to present facts you just need to laugh and point
the media perception of california is bad
largest gsp gross state product however conservatives have been painting a picture that california is a hellscape
times were different then california is seen in a very different light by many people nowadays
you mean before he even spoke
jesus i wish you had the memory of gold fish that way you could forget all the stupid shit you just spewed out
it ’s actually the 20 seconds before he said we beat medicare that were the most painful
the biden of 15 years ago is n’t going to replicate 81 million votes anybody seriously think that he or any candidates had a shot at hitting that number again is a fool
the alternative of keeping biden is a higher risk this is an unprecedented moment but the switch is necessary to beat trump
any replacement level democrat can beat trump bidens performance last night showed he is below replacement if he can go on a media blitz on every show and podcast he might be able to correct the narrative i do n't know if he is capable of that
whitmer newsom harris might lose and probably would be favored to lose joe 100 % will lose it 's a no brainer people are still just in denial
a generic democrat has been outpolling biden and beating trump for months the obvious problem happens to be a fatal one in this case
absolutely not the same thing
that was n't the same and you know it
it ’s funny that folks are hyper critical of biden ’s perception and then think newsom among rust belt or others is light years better that disconnect is astounding
it was painful because you could see where it would likely conclude but we were n't able to see any attempt to rectify it because the mic was turned off
difference between risk and expected outcome having a 0 % chance of success is low risk but a horrible expected outcome taking a coin flip is higher risk but a much better expected outcome i 'd much rather take the coin flip
joe 100 % will lose so would the other three you mentioned if you want to make the argument that a new candidate should be nominated on principle that 's fine but do n't pretend the end result wo n't be the same
have you seen this guy who paints his face orange lives in towers and beach palaces and who has a gold alloyed toilet surely that guy must appeal to the working class
the problem is that you think biden is the coin flip and not the 0 percent edit i misinterpreted
you ca n't know that people 's latched onto they do n't have name recognition but if you 're the democratic nominee you 're going to get name recognition very fast and democrats have almost every media and news organization on call to help the public get to know the new candidate most people do n't want a choice between trump or biden they want someone younger polling backs this up so i 'm not sure it would backfire the way people think meanwhile harris ' approval ratings are higher than biden 's she virtually neck and neck with trump but unlike trump harris has room to grow trump has statistically reached his ceiling
i prefer pritzker i could support whitmer i think newsom is a lot weaker than people think i think jon stewart could be a free win if this is really the election that matters for all time
they consider newsom a coastal elite but not trump i ’m not saying it makes sense but that ’s the reality we live in
two things about that another disconnect of what is reality and perception and he appealing to them for different reasons
no i think the new candidate is the coin flip
sorry i misinterpreted too many do think biden is the lesser risk unfortunately
people need to learn that those that watched are crazy junkies hell i am a crazy junkie and zero people changed their minds seriously who are the people that turned it off hardcore democrats are they voting for trump hell no everybody made a choice in 2020 this is a repeat and only getting the same people that voted for biden to vote again in 2024 is all that matters everything else is noise are you doing your part to volunteer without a primary there is no clean plan b only messy messy plan bs
i 'm sick of all the trump news sick of the day to day political drama it 's exhausting i already know how i 'm voting i just want it to be over
wait so this does n’t count streaming viewers it ’s useless then
well yeah it 's june lots of people are not going to be tuned in at all until september
are they counting people who watched the first few minutes and stopped watching because it was too depressing
this debate was less chaotic than the 2020 debates but somehow more depressing
it was n’t on every channel like previous presidential debates aside from that it was hard to watch and there are n’t many people interested in either candidate minds are mostly already made up
the only good news from last night lol
so it 's not even worth it cnn this is what you sold out democracy for worse ratings
people watch highlights and clips from these events not the actual events
it was the middle of summer on a thursday night so many better things to do but the highlights were interesting to say the least
we still got the conventions and possibly another debate there will be no change in the polls until september october
i 'm not surprised i did n't watch it saw some bit pieces i mean it 's a rematch of 2020 i feel like most people know where they stand a debate is n't changing much they are both beyond known qualities also 2020 debates were shit too trump turns them into shitshows i had no interest bummer that biden was supposedly bad though
pretty much everyone thought the same thing i thought i know who i 'm voting for if anything crazy happens it will be on the internet a second later i have better thing to do the people who have n't settled on who they 're voting for are n't exactly people who vote often anyway and certainly are n't plugged into the system
i could n't stand to watch after 15 minutes or so
i did n't watch it live seen trump veer off topic and not answer questions once seen it a million times
shocker turns out no one watches debates no one cares that is n't how the vast majority of people pick the person they will vote for
because no one wants either to win
did anyone really need a debate to make their final decision on not to vote for putin ’s puppet
no reason to watch the charade everyone already decided back in 16
i 'd vote for literally anyone other than the oath breaking pos who broke our perfect record of peaceful transfers of power
yeah everyone already made up their minds who they ’re voting for and i ’m sorry but if you ’re still undecided you ’re a moron it ’s completely clear on who to vote for if you still want a country vote biden or we ’re lost
yea i 've been saying this all day this sub and media massively overplays the number of people who tune into debates especially this early in a campaign they used to mean something but have n't for years most of the people i talked to yesterday who are regular voters did n't even remember the debate was happening last night and most were planning to watch the orioles game instead granted i live in md where you could roll out a literal donkey and it would win the state
people may not sit down and watch these things but they sure scroll social media for the highlights what do you believe they saw
i ’ve said it 1000 times this election wo n’t shift meaningfully until the fall
i would like a plan where the guy who 's in charge is n't drooling into a cup on a stage for a f hour
you ’re on r politics go take a break or a sports or entertainment sub it ’s needed very so often to be reminded that there ’s more to the world then politics
the nielsen numbers will include streaming these are just from cnn
everyone i know streamed it
let 's face it the 2020 biden trump debate if it held in june would attract more viewers what we witnessed on television yesterday were a convicted felon uttering falsehoods and a figure who mumbled with his mouth agape all evening
those people are not voting for trump ever why worry about them why demoralize people
no other channels got to play it too just with the cavet that it had cnn branding
yup i was watching the wnba and i almost never watch the wnba i posted this elsewhere but it fits it 's 4 months until the election if you 're still undecided on whom you 're going to vote for and need a debate between two octogenarians to help you decide you 've got pudding for brains debates are for ratings
trouble is biden improved after those first 15 minutes particularly after the first break but those first 10 minutes really shook the audience
i think trump was business as usual with his insanity but the real shock was how much worse biden looked than last time
how tf did we end up with a convicted felon on the presidential debate stage and not a single person expected him to even tell the truth just once but that ’s somehow also fine
what they wanted to see if they are maga they follow vivek hence no minds changed if they are pro biden they watch obama no minds changed
even if there is a shift after the debate wo n’t matter bc of conventions in a month
that is not a plan that is making a wish
nielsen is unreliable you have to opt into their tracking they 've had problems with accurately getting data for years
stuck at the cmd fiddling with his config sys and then finally the os started
i only saw a couple of minutes in total and biden looked and sounded like the old white guy that he is i really do n't get the faux surprise that the 80 year old sounds like he 's 80 he did n't get old overnight
in a sane country trump and his lackeys would n't be able to show their faces in public
trump is n't even a realistic option anybody who 's considering him is some kind of grifter or somebody who is too stupid to be able to vote i 'm talking about the team that is supposed to be the good guys i 'm talking about the guys who are telling me that this office the presidency is too important to let a convicted felon criminal piece of garbage be in but at the same time is running a man who is clearly at the end of a long mental decline that is nowhere near what is required to hold the office donald trump is a grade a piece of human garbage but what does that have to do with running a man in his ' 80s to be president a man who told us he was fine and that he was going to be able to do this job not through the election but for another 4 years and he ca n't put together a coherent idea about abortion this carrying water that we all are expected to do because i 'm on the blue team and they 're on the red team and the red team is bad needs to stop we need to be honest brokers on this side of the aisle we need to have honest conversations about what is going on and this is unacceptable and as long as we continue to carry this water for them and tell them that this is okay because we do n't have any other choice we wo n't have any other choice we do have a choice we do have enough time to elect someone else and if we need to go down on our sword as a result of that which it looks like we 're going to do anyway because joe biden ca n't win this election that i would rather go down on my sword doing what 's right then just doing the blue version of what the red team is doing
i thought their recent iterations required the trackimg software onto household computers and such
i know right i think it was just extra shocking because it seemed way worse than his state of the union or his debate the last time around
nope you have to opt in on whatever platform you use they only recently got back their accreditation they 'd lost it for a while because they could n't back up their data
it 's weird how the article concentrates on the states with automatic registration if the law changed women would be required to register in all states just as men are
no one has been drafted in over 50 years can we stop acting like this matters at all
the trump camp wants one year mandatory military service for all high school and college aged people maybe this will be enough to get them out to vote i wo n't feel bad when the tiktoks of buses being loaded with kids just graduating make their rounds
a draft will never happen again these past 2 generations are not willing to give their lives for the us and rightfully so the only way would be if there was an invasion which is not possible
it ’s about time why am i getting downvoted this is what equality looks like
the draft would be more palatable if it could be fair we all know it would never be fair just imagine baron trump getting the call and then actually enlisting
first it 's the womb then it 's the body and finally it 's their life
do n’t they do that in russia
biden is president the the biggest liberal states are an automatic no interesting
yeah i male had to fill out a draft card in 1998 i just checked not interest for every branch of the military this is not requirement to serve should n't still be called a draft which recalls vietnam war era injustices
as they should why ca n’t women be required for selective service like men you ’re all applauding the war in ukraine we should join them and beat back the russian forces
well if it does n't matter it should not be a problem to extend it to women should n't it
yeah no way in hell my kids would be a part of that
you ’re saying all these things and then you just disappear
the only way would be if there was an invasion which is not possible nice try canadian psy ops operative
us millennials fought a war twenty year war over two fronts do n't give me this bullshit that some of us are not willing to sacrifice if the country asks even if th3 politicians are absolute clowns
never happen again is a strong statement most likely no there wo n't be a draft but we do have a draft board ready to go with people and systems in place i am a board member for the sss i seriously doubt we will do a draft and if we do a draft then it means shit hit the fan given all of this i do n't think women should get drafted if shit hits the fan
a huge chunk of the vietnam generation were n’t willing but it was either serve in the military or serve in prison
“ you think those hippies in washington and oregon are going to stop them ”
not sure what hard for you to grasp we do n't want a draft for anyone male or female
those states have 2x the number of available troops and thus get 2x the amount of plastic army counters in risk
he inherited bones spurs from his dad
no russia is a backwards country they only conscript men it ’s civilized countries that rightly demand everyone to do their duty regardless of sex if need be israel norway sweden france portugal the netherlands
not sure what you filled out but the selective service registration does not ask anything about your interest in different branches it only asks for your contact information birthdate and ssn
why ca n’t women because you wanna whine about it opposition specifically the john birch society 1970s
remember when conservatives said roe v wade was settled law
you ’ll notice that op said and not trump himself
they 're gon na invade and turn all of our starbucks into tim hortons
yeah two losing wars that were started over lies
if things are dire to the point where they need to not only reinstate the draft but start drafting women and sending them to the front lines then we are probably a dead nation no matter what
provide your rationale on why they should n't be drafted
women in israel with some exceptions serve a 2 year mandatory service if equal is equal i ’m not sure why we should be so special
i do n’t understand what ’s hard for you to grasp you ’ve already signed up for selective service we are about to go defend ukraine
in 1998 when i received it it had 4 boxes to check asking what branch of the military i 'd be interested in and one ' none of the above it was my draft card i had to sign it and return it my male friends all got the same card if that 's not what you saw do n't just assume i 'm wrong
no need for the era to have women also register for the selective service however it is also the republicans who keep blocking attempts to extend it to women with the ndaas of the last few years 2021 2022 and now again
because trump himself does not matter trump himself could n't care less about policy trump himself is there to play tv president while his camp does the actual governing and policy making
sorry we have starbucks too we would just build the tim ’s next to the starbucks but unfortunately the company is not canadian anymore after being sold off
has nothing to do with your original comment
nonsense israel has always drafted women in peace and in war including the current one the uk drafted over 600 000 childless young women in its auxiliary services during ww2 drafting women does n’t mean send them straight to the frontlines where their lower physical strength would be an issue most army roles are support roles where one is not even directly involved in combat
women need to make babies and get pregnant after the war
not just israel sweden and norway also have mandatory military service for both sexes denmark will extend it to women in 2027 france portugal and the netherlands where there is no active conscription have extended their own version of the selective service to women years ago
i ’m not assuming i ’m knowing whatever you filled out it was not the selective service registration card or you ’re misremembering those boxes do n’t just assume your memory from that long ago is accurate
we can all see how many comments you have on this post
men are needed too for that do n't come up with the but one man can make ten women pregnant bullshit never once happened in modern history after a war never gon na happen that 's not how modern human societies work
thanks for the info i had no idea there were so many
ok i ’m doing cocaine and playing elden ring my bad in all honesty i wish biden did n’t screw up my buzz all he had to do was not be old
i would love to see the two of them play 9 holes and do a little stump speech while the other is playing it would be a nice lighthearted change of pace that could give an candid insight into the minds of these two old fucks
the world saw only a confused 81 year old standing between america and dictatorship while not good for biden or the hopes of the democrats this is hyperbolic
already convinced this is all gon na blow over in a few days if not by the end of the weekend debates pretty much only sway undecideds undecideds already view this race as “ feeble old man vs trump ” and the data that ’s come out so far seems to show nothing ’s changed biden can only improve with those voters from here i thought thursday was a catastrophe now i think it was merely a missed opportunity
i ’ve donated to the campaigns of both biden and trump just so they can send me exclusive stuff one of my hobbies is collecting political memorabilia so president biden if you drop new merch or coffee mugs you can count on my continued support
why donate to a demented octogenarian destined to lose
even if it does i hope it puts an end to the idea that he has n’t declined the last month anytime you suggested it you were down voted and given shit for it when you pointed out he looked old and slow in a lot of videos i also do n’t get the “ he looked good today ” arguments like yeah even old senile people have good days if of you ’re the president you should n’t be having “ bad days ”
that 's what i think too if he keeps doing the rallies as he 's done after the debate maybe he can gain back what he lost in the debate the election was never about biden it was always about trump either you want trump or you do n't
can someone please lend me a billion so i can build housing
here in al these people will be thrown in jail in some cities where they will be used as forced labor that 's not hyperbole there is a federal lawsuit pending right now about this very thing prisoners being forced into labor and punished beaten if they refuse on top of the other doj investigation about al prison abuse drug overdoses murders sex assaults one alabama city fired most of their landscaping crew and are using prison labor instead the current lawsuit states that alabama makes 500 000 000 year from prison labor god help these unhoused people this is sickening
despicable ruling by despicable people this country is barreling toward something that we wo n't be able to get out of with politics and courts
um supreme court that sounds like a really shitty thing to do it ’s almost like you ’re not actually there to serve the public edit i get that ’s not how the supreme court works and also according to the article this is exactly what people wanted in cali so it ’s not just them being evil little shits does n’t make it any less gross supreme court can still go fuck itself and now o have to wonder the hell are the homeless expected to do also changed language to sound less clueless
so we gon na house them in tax payer funded for profit prisons then they ’re not out there roasting marshmallows and weenies on a camping trip they do n’t have homes
if we do n’t allow them to be visible in public they wo n’t exist anymore problem solved s
there ’s a guy in my city who ’s been thrown in jail 39 times at last count for vagrancy he ’s an addict with mental illness but not dangerous and there has seemingly been no effort to get him the help he needs it ’s sad
in california which is home to one third of the country ’s homeless population democratic gov gavin newsom said the decision gives state and local officials the authority to clear “ unsafe encampments ” from the streets while acting with compassion “ this decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years ” he said that is a surprising response from newsom
this is horrible no one wants to live on the street punishing people for being homeless is so disgusting life is hard enough for them and arresting the homeless will just make it harder the only way to get them off the street is to provide them with more help and access to resources beating them when they ’re down is just going to make it even more difficult to build a “ normal ” life this is sad
go back to america ya bums am do republican right
so what are these folks supposed to do then die
just lie and say you want to build a sports ball stadium boom free billion in taxpayer funds
usa has the resources just not the will
sorry we need to use that money to build more jails prisons instead s
has n't california spent like 20 billion in homelessness
slavery is legal in the us just read the 13th amendment it plainly says that slavery is okay as long as it ’s punishment for a crime
honestly if they are properly trained and can do the job that gives them a potential job once they get out of slave labor but this requires people that are caring but stern to actually push through whatever antisocial behavior these people have and to prop them back up problem s being what i mentioned above does n’t exist people are crap so the prisoners will be beaten regardless whether doing a good job or not employers look down on former prisoners the current prison system is n’t really about reforming ’ to fit back in to society they are provided no housing and a bill for being in prison when released this is why there are repeat criminals
that ’s not how the supreme court works
text % e2%80%9ctoday's%20ruling%20by%20the%20u s unsafe%20encampments%20from%20our%20streets governor and our mayor all behind the verdict i wish more liberal judges joins this time with conservative you have to handle case by case yes this bad for gop states where they will criminalize homeless but in california people are allowed to stay in streets even the shelter is offered do you know why many hate democrats because of the homeless finally we will be able to built shelter and curb street drugs we tried sro where we had the most overdose now non profits asking a care worker and house sorry this is not feasible also most sfpd arrests of homeless drug use are not even from sf most of them were from other states it ’s not okay for people to put a tent in front your home and do drugs and also not okay in front of schools
prisons may not be the answer but forced mental institutions should come back regan dismantled the mental health care system and this is the result
the only form of social welfare republicans approve of
they 'll just have to sleep in their motorcoaches
“ they are unrealized profit and they ’re an eyesore so win win ” republicans and scotus quietly
guy like that has lost the ability to make good decisions for himself this is what only institutions can do provide a last ditch hope of ever turning his life around never gon na do it on his own
no they 're going to be made into slaves text of the thirteenth amendment emphasis mine section 1 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction section 2 congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation
so that is how you became a billionaire
yet somehow i got zero
now point to where it says they can be beaten and punished if they are too sick to work
i do n't like how you 're assuming antisocial behavior these people have this is a complex issue and boiling it down to anti social behavior is bs they have every reason to be anti social or to have whatever feeling they have that you feel like you need to slap a negative label on
put simply no but also it kinda does they ’re the final arbiters of the law and the constitution we the people voted for various politicicians to make amendments and changes to those laws and the constitution they are refusing to do so christ one of them believes there should n’t be any amendments that freaking lady would n’t be able to vote without those amendments granted they ’re supposed to remain impartial but i think we all know they ’re not doing that they also claimed they would respect the abortion law when they were being sworn in that was a lie they ’re the current reason nothing is getting done and i think a lot of us are ready for a change
is the time money and resources available for all that though in my state they ’re always looking for excuses to cut funding to things like homeless shelters “ banning ” them from sleeping outside like what ’s that do for them or anyone it just seems like malice for the sake of malice look i do n’t live in the same place as you i ’ll concede your opinion carries more weight than mine if you freaking live there but it ’s hard for me to fathom what good this will do it makes homeless people even more desperate and desperation leads to all kinds of shitty things
the only answer nurse ratched retired years ago we could do better this time
so let 's say that socialized healthcare is a thing lol and that this guy or someone like him gets the treatment and medicine he needs to get in a good place mentally for free because he certainly ca n't pay for it where will he live with 39 arrests on his record who is going to willingly house him arresting the homeless to help them is a nonsensical stance
seems like a california corruption problem to me
the 13 allows forced labor as soon as they are convicted of a crime they lose the right to refuse work i do n’t agree with it but it ’s the laws we have
for this particular instance they made a ruling that california state legislators brought up about eradicating homeless encampments being a violation against the 8th amendment which they nearly unanimously agreed upon in fact the voting base who elected those legislators wanted this too happen because of “ muh precious property value ” so in this instances they are doing their jobs did you read the article
like i mentioned it ’s bad for homeless in gop states in california we are trying best sf has built the most affordable homes per capita in nation by a huge margin our housing issues are nimby progressives who are against new construction we have a bigger overdose issues in sro
yes mental heath care and treatment has come a long way since the 50 60s shock treatments we have great pharmaceuticals now they just need to be in a controlled environment until their doses can be dialed in
you 're not answering the question at this point i think you may like to hear yourself talk there is no need for you to keep repeating yourself as i stated you ca n't beat someone because they 're too sick to work
wait what ’s sro in this case
they do still do electroconvulsive therapy i think it ’s supposed to be safer now and it ’s only used for depression and even then as a last resort sort of thing
you can punish them for not working because they have no right to refuse work even if they are sick they get away with beating them simply by saying they were required to use force to control them the same way every other law enforcement agency gets away with it they are “ working within the law ” by writing in their paperwork that they used necessary force to control them in tennessee if you refuse to work you are put in solitary confinement and receive no credit for time served while refusing to work so if you refuse to work they can hold you indefinitely until you work it is slavery and prisoners do not have the same rights that we have
no you ca n't bye felicia
i think i ’m missing something if drugs are a bigger problem inside than out than how would banning them from sleeping outside help prevent the drug problem edit is that what you meant when you said “ overdose ”
let 's swap both candidates out how about al gore versus dan quayle
have we all considered taking like a single breath
this is actually not as simple as biden drops out everything is cool now if biden goes they almost have to replace him with harris otherwise they open a big can of identity politics worms pushing aside a black women for a white dude like gavin newsom or something would be a problem especially because black women are a very reliable voting block for the dems the problem is harris is not that popular so replacing biden is actually kinda tricky this is just one of a ton of problems that would come up they would have to find a candidate that does n’t cause any of these problems
i wish the article articulated how big of an undertaking that would be
i think we 're going to see some historical stuff soon or actually are seeing it now
this is n't about democratic voters this is about people who typically will not vote biden as a candidate looking like a corpse and stuttering and mumbling unintelligible responses to basic questions means that those people who typically would n't vote maybe have never voted will see no reason to vote this term either that hurts biden and more importantly that hurts all dems down ballot policy especially policy without a charismatic figure to amplify it does not win elections especially not elections this close
they 're not wrong right now 538 has the race at about 50 50 do you really want to let the fate of our democracy rest on 50 50 chances i 'll vote for biden 's corpse if i have to but i do n't want to bet others will do the same
if only the establishment had listened to the polls saying voters do n’t want trump vs biden 2 0 2016 vibes
if biden is n't going to step down then he needs to hold a conference where he addresses these suggestions and convincingly rejects them get people back on board even if it 's all script and teleprompter
alternatively nyt editorial board urges biden to drop out because of one bad debate but not the convicted felon who literally tried to forcefully stay in office after losing the election
donors vs dnc strap in
so many democrats are in denial right now shrugging off biden 's debate performance as if it were just an off night like it 's no big deal biden did n't just look old and feeble he looked and sounded like he was gon na drop dead at any second and he 's not getting any younger healthier or more coherent i have a bad feeling democrats will be too stubborn to replace him then trump will win and the dnc will blame everyone but themselves for the loss just like they did in 2016 personally i 'll vote for biden if he 's the nominee simply because i understand that we 're voting for an entire administration and not just the one person we call president but unfortunately there 's enough people out there who do n't see the big picture and wo n't show up to vote for a candidate that already looks halfway in the ground and that could lead trump to victory
i wonder if this is being put out because a decision has already been made
the clearest path for democrats to defeat a candidate defined by his lies is to deal truthfully with the american public acknowledge that mr biden ca n’t continue his race and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place to defeat mr trump in november create a process to select someone those six words gloss over the craziness we 're headed towards i wonder if the editorial board fully considered the range of outcomes that may come out of an undemocratic power struggle the final candidate must survive the process and coalesce support of the wide range of democratic factions this may be needed but we must be aware of the peril
i ’ve been saying biden is too old for months and i ’ve been ridiculed but there are infinitely better candidates and it ’s time for a real old school convention fuck the gop fuck djt
that debate last night was actually disturbing our democracy is on the line i believe that our democracy is in fact over if corrupt donnie gets back in biden was not competent in that debate last night last night was his chance to win over the american people but his performance lack of performance fulfilled what republicans have been painting him as we need a commanding nominee now and we all need to fight to support that nominee the stakes here are dire
the nyt editorial board is a pretty big voice to be saying that that 's a big deal
i do n't think there 's any good way out of this if biden drops out there will be a contested convention which will break the democrats wide open while there are at least a half a dozen fairly decent candidates none have any kind of momentum at all with the exception of harris whose momentum is probably going in the wrong direction if this was going to be done it should have been months ago or preferably a year or two ago giving the democrats plenty of time to beat the living crap out of each other before finding a decent consensus ticket to my mind it 's too late biden stepping down now just unleashes chaos and trump and the gop walk up the middle because at the end of the day voters will pick the party that is n't eating itself alive even if it 's only because that party is preparing to eat everyone else alive over a party slinging grenades at each other
it is a huge fucking deal that the new york times just called for a sitting president to step down
my guess is a lot will depend on the next polls
donald trump has proved himself to be a significant jeopardy to that democracy an erratic and self interested figure unworthy of the public trust he systematically attempted to undermine the integrity of elections his supporters have described publicly a 2025 agenda that would give him the power to carry out the most extreme of his promises and threats if he is returned to office he has vowed to be a different kind of president unrestrained by the checks on power built into the american political system
i like whitmer i 'd be good with her
the chief executive of the most powerful country in the world has the most demanding physical and mental requirements you can imagine you only need to look at pictures of presidents before and after leaving office to get a sense of these demands a human over the age of seventy much less seventy five has no business taking on this role
biden is going to drag down all the down ballot races
i like biden but he does n't instill confidence no one is doing us any favors by encouraging him to stay in the race
did the new york times call for donald trump to drop out of the race after he was indicted on 34 criminal counts i must have missed that s
hey guess what still voting for joe
so does this mean that the democrats are getting ready to privately evict biden behind closed doors
they are n't putting one man 's ego ahead of the future of the country and they are right
but no call for trump to drop out interesting
if he drops out with 4 months left it 's going to do more harm to the democrats party and the administration than people think it 's telling the voters that the party has no idea what they 're doing biden needs harris to step even more in his campaign
trump was right apparently the nyt is failing
nytimes also thinks word fragments can be homophones perhaps they should be making noise about the convicted felon and dropping out
the 25th amendment is coming next
has anyone stepped up to say they 're ready and happy to replace biden no then stfu you have no plan
i am not a troll or someone who hates biden i volunteered for his campaign in 2020 and i am quite certain he is going to lose badly i do n’t think he has better chances than other dems at this point maybe he did before but probably not now
the ny times who also relentlessly pounded the war drum for the iraq war and gleefully shoved bush administration lies down our throats that ny times that debate was a nuclear train wreck for biden i wo n’t deny that but that self righteous rag is n’t even worthy to wipe the aftermath of taco bell off my hairy ass
he should step down and allow another dem to run even if he can somehow defeat trump he does not have the mental capacity to govern for 4 years that is clear he 'll be nothing but a rubber stamp for an unelected clique surrounding him and i do n't see how that is supposed to be democracy
i 'm no joe manchin fan but i almost think that 's the answer this year what do you think
what did they say about the convicted felon rapist dude
now urge trump to drop out for being a rapist felon liar you fuvks
yes the nytimes is heavily financially invested in trump winning
yikes and to think i was about to buy a times subscription bad debate awful i would love to see another candidate but to run to this conclusion and publish it 24 hours after the debate where this evening he was kicking ass at a rally that ’s just cringey
none of the people here know how elections work they are not determined by candidate quality they ’re determined by governance the current party is ruling well enough to easily win re election getting rid of biden will backfire and will cost the democrats everything but if you want trump to win fine get rid of him
we are asking the editorial board of the new york times to step down
breaking news new york times suspends publication in the press release the times editorial staff wrote after 172 years we have clearly lost a step
wish the news articles would stop doing fear monger stories and stop reporting nonsense if he drops out the chances of trump winning are even more likely to happen biden drops out you end up with either harris or an unknown that most likely will not gain the majority of votes now if both parties decide that neither should run for president and do a fresh restart and find actual good candidates for both parties then sure drop out but since that ’s not a valid solution in this point in time it be wiser to keep going and convince the people both parties why you should be stay president
everyone saying biden needs to step down is wasting their time he ’s not dropping and if he did trump would certainly win he is the only chance to beat trump it ’s too late the train has already left the station and it ’s one way
sulzberger has a long standing grudge against biden
lately i value the new york times ’ opinion right up there with the speaker of the house ’s
if he wants to run then let him trump will lose no matter what
“ biden wo n’t give us an interview so he should drop out ”
al gore who is 76 vs dan quayle who is 77
not a bad idea honestly
yeah do n't get me wrong it was a terrible performance and i 'm all for internal conversations to be had about him to step down but maybe wait a few days before calling for him to step down today he looked more like his usual self
do you take a minute to relax and collect yourself when the house is on fire that ship sailed about a year ago the time to act is now or not at all and face the consequences
no this is a crisis anyway you put it
they could tell the truth we need the swing states and a candidate who will help the party perform strongly there because there 's not much point in going through the upheaval of replacing biden for anything less than that
harris does n’t want the job her office has been riddled with turnover issues as well she wo n’t be it unless biden dies dems can still have the identity politics win with gretchen whitmer and she ’s extremely qualified popular and can get the midwestern vote which is where it matters most newsom is a bad choice as conservatives and moderates have long made up their mind about him on account of representing california
harris needs to also graciously step aside
the real problem is kamala is fucking terrible maybe if we 're being honest about the ticket we can be actually honest and shitcan both of them
why is n't buttigieg mentioned more my favorite ticket would be harris buttigieg
biden absolutely already should replace kamala on the ticket put someone actually popular in there and a lot of people wo n’t be as concerned about him keeling over halfway into his term
if biden goes they almost have to replace him with harris no they do n't they can go 1952 style on the convention and just elect someone else it could be anyone
would kamala harris even want to run vs trump failing to defeat trump killed hillary 's career i do n't think kamala wants that as the end of her legacy i do n't think newsom wants to leave his position as governor if there 's a chance of losing to trump either finding a brand new willing candidate who can also realistically defeat trump is impossible today
it did cover this in detail
it basically ca n’t be done no other person has the funding to campaign anyone with their hair on fire about it is shilling for trump
we have been seeing it nearly nonstop since 2016 tbh
what do you mean exactly
historically funny man this is incredible
do n’t think for a second democratic voters were n’t lost because of this debate they were it was that bad they might not vote trump but they ai n’t voting biden
after that debate you 're voting in jill biden and her cabinet there is no way joe is lucid enough to run this country it 's a shame that as a nation we have to force a senile man that should be enjoying what time he has left on earth to instead be running for office
this were the chances before the debate i doubt it ’s still 50 50
538 has been worthless since 2016
bidens campaign has 200 million in cash which can be transfered to kamala harris only any new candidate would have to start from scratch kamala is deeply unpopular i still think it should happen but i doubt it would greatly increase the odds for dems
the only way it 's a 50 50 odd is if you cherry pick i 'm a democrat who has voted for dems i 'm voting for kennedy on this one
1 biden only here cause of trump 2 if that were true then the debate should be nikki vs newsom but that not the reality people do nt want young people otherwise we would already get it so cut the sob and keep voting
he pretty much did in 2 speeches today but the media is n’t going to forget that quickly
he held a rally and came across as a completely different person
script and teleprompter is n't going to cut it if he ca n't handle facing an opponent he 's not ready to defeat trump
mr biden would likely present himself to a jury as he did during our interview of him as a sympathetic well meaning elderly man with a poor memory
he did that and frankly by all accounts it looks like biden gained votes while convicted felon trump and his dilated pupils managed to lose votes i went to bed fearing the worst but i 've never seen so many people who do n't comment on politics piping up to mention that they did n't really care about how joe looked because trump did so much worse that he reminded them how much they hated hearing his voice every day for 4 years
i 'd rather we do it without a script and teleprompter let 's see if it was a bad night or if we need to have a serious conversation about his capacity over the next 4 years
biden need to stop malaky take your drug joe and win the next debate you do nt have to be alive next year but you sure hell need to be living this year
the new york times urging trump to drop out would have a lot of impact and influence i 'm sure
if you read the article they talk about that republicans simply do n't give a shit about trump 's convictions nor do they care about the opinion of the nyt the nyt wants to stop trump because he 's uniquely dangerous and biden demonstrated that he is simply not up to the task of campaigning and winning against trump
nyt has been predominantly anti trump for 8 years have you even ever read a nyt article also whataboutism is ironically a classic maga tactic this nonsense has no business having 50 upvotes
stop saying it 's one bad debate his age and cognitive decline have been an issue since last year
that 's not the point the question is whether he can win an election that 's the only thing that matters right now
democrats should hold our nominees to a high standard no matter how low republicans go and the nyt knows republicans do n’t give a shit
alternatively “ donors panic as dnc backs biden after debate ”
absolutely biden has no downside as president and some upside trump has no upside and limitless downside they want to throw some third party into this who by definition will have no mandate and therefore no upside and completely unknown but possibly very significant downside being completely untried on the national stage and in foreign relations what is their game seriously
one bad debate is n’t the point though because we have to assume it is a permanent condition and not just a blip
i keep seeing posts and memes about how we have to loyal to biden and ca n’t desert him sorry but i do n’t give a shit about being nice to biden if we are going to lose the election to trump so ridiculous also i thought it was n’t about blind loyalty to a person
when you have to beg your supporters to keep faith with your candidate that usually is n't a sign of a party that is going to win an election if hardcore democrats are struggling to see the positive of biden staying then what the hell are independents and swing voters thinking
“ our candidate might have been sundowning during the debate but he was coherent during a rally the next day so nbd ” democratic party leaders this afternoon as if biden is suddenly going to get younger or less cognitively impaired by the fall
neither is trump getting younger both are in their 70 ’s if biden ran in 2016 trump would n't be a thing he would have fizzled out and we would have never heard from him again running and winning the presidency was the worst thing ever to happen to him it uncovered so much that if he did n't run all that would still be under the rug he 's trying to avoid the statute of limitations by running again and the recent power grab by the supreme court was just in preparation for his victory should he win democrats dropped the ball in 2016 and it 's been biting them since then they had the opportunity to expand the senate in 2016 and 2020 and dropped the ball beto for president instead of trying to take a senate seat in texas againat a mediocre candidate out of cornyn that would push texas to purple that 's just one of many examples of where the democrats missed the mark if biden drops out they wo nt get themselves together to put up a viable candidate with 4 months to go and let alone be able to strategically position senator and house seats
biden is going to win remember trump has turned off a lot of independent voters who do vote and he has turned off religious extremists who will only settle for a potus who supports a complete ban on abortion the latter group is already pissed and will either sit out or not vote for trump
yeah me too it makes me wonder what the hell is going on behind closed doors right now are they getting ready to let go of biden something in my gut is telling me that it is gon na happen because the louder that speculation grows the more likely the outcome that is speculated upon will occur media is only growing louder and louder to replace him i would n’t be surprised if over the next few days the democrats announce an open convention and decide to dump biden that could be both a good thing and a bad thing maybe more of a good thing than a bad thing especially if they get someone like gretchen whitmer i think this is galvanizing democrats to take action and dump biden call me crazy but it ’s gon na happen it seems to me that something is gon na happen that nobody expects especially since now the calls to evict him from the race are growing louder and louder and we ’ll see biden either being forced to drop out or he decides to drop out on his own terms
the challenge ahead of us is keeping trump out of power that 's it that 's the goal if biden ca n't do it anymore it 's time for him to step down and let someone else take the lead
nyt editorial is liberal we already know they do n't want trump to win and republicans would n't listen to them anyway urging trump to step down would be a waste of time on the other hand if enough democrats urge biden to step down he might do it and it may just save the country from another four years of trump
they are saying biden should drop out because trump is such a huge threat to democracy we ca n’t risk it that is the whole point of the statement they put out
because the ny times has been compromised for a while
i do n’t think you know or understand what is actually happening you ’re just saying things
did you read the article it clearly addresses that
lol whatabout what about do you understand why the nyt is posting this article lol
i do n't think any republican is going to pay much attention to what the nyt suggests
i do n't understand talking about ' undemocratic power struggle ' in the context that we did n't have a real primary even with biden 's approval rating consistently in the 30s most people only had a choice between biden and uncommitted and most people were n't going to bother checking either box some states even had their state party cancel the primary outright
well i also thought he was too old but i did n’t think it would matter that much to the majority of people apparently it does so he should n’t run if he ca n’t beat trump my thing was just that i want someone who can beat trump and if he ca n’t do that he needs to step aside
i agree but they do n’t seem to care
the gen z pack mentality libs are quite literally going to kill us
a contested convention is n't automatically a disaster we had them for decades as a matter of routine the contest would draw lots of attention and provide a forum for the public to get to know the other candidates it would add excitement far beyond whatever the boring republicans do in milwaukee next week it 's democracy at work in the most basic sense without any predetermined outcome i think a truly competitive convention would be the best thing to happen to democrats in years
nah this is just the fear mongering the dnc wants you believe anyone capable can come in and beat trump i do n’t think people realize how neither side wants trump to win except for magas dems are too just arrogant and do n’t want a progressive in office
no other candidate has momentum because biden has been the assumed nominee if he drops out there will surely emerge a candidate that pulls ahead of the rest the party and voters will fall in behind this scenario feels more promising than continuing this biden charade
i think people really overestimate the fracture to democratic unity this could have democrats are as united as ever you see the sentiment on this subreddit all the time we ’d vote for a literal corpse over trump whoever they ’d replace biden with would enjoy resounding support among the base
it did n't it asked him to support another candidate he would still be president until january 2025
a democratic president specifically if that debate did n't end his candidacy on its own this just did
which probably means after this is all said and done perhaps the dems and republicans should work together to amend the constitution to make the maximum age to stand for president is 66 including re election the us is beginning to look like the ussr in the 1980s with decrepit rotting sclerotic and in at least one case cancer ridden old men at kremlin parades
it 's the new york times do they really need to write that editorial
nope that would be a waste of time here 's an editorial from this year warning the public how dangerous he is a warning about donald trump and 2024
a fundamental rule of good writing is to know your audience the nyt board knows theirs and ed boards do n’t write op eds to be objective this is an editorial board understanding their audience enough to plead a persuasive argument within the scope of their interests the significance comes from their knowledge that most of their readership probably supports biden and they are intentionally disturbing that paradigm that ’s a pretty fucking big deal coming from the nyt however in understanding their audience calling for trump to step down is n’t really necessary while openly acknowledging his return to power is akin to an apocalypse of democracy to invalidate their argument because of such a small distinction feels cheap and regressive
you 're missing the point the editorial also addresses the danger of trump which is why they wrote this read it first then feel free to criticize it
they are saying this because they want trump to lose
i disagree as an independent it looks to me like the democrats are trying to commit suicide if they picked almost any other candidate it would instill confidence in the party
other than the party liners we 've all known the party does not know what it 's doing and have been raising alarm bells for years when he took a year to acknowledge the greatest cost of living crisis of our time was when he lost this this is embarrassing those on the left have been trying to warn you for a long time now you ignored us
if he drops out now it will show the party has finally listened to the voters
the more harris is seen the less people like her
sorry but no it ’s not an admission that his agenda has been a failure biden ’s first term has been a success legislatively and under the circumstances he was under he ’d be bowing out for purely personal reasons related to his age which there ’s no shame in doing it ’s not a rebuke of his agenda it ’d be a humble and honorable thing to do in sense of a duty to this country
they took a gamble and they are losing better to leave with some chips than lose it all
no running joe biden is telling the voters they have no idea what they ’re doing
they probably had this already to go and was waiting for a moment like this to release it they ’re idiots at worst for ignoring the chaos that would be created and trump supporters at worst they “ suggest ” he step down just like r ’s state “ state ’s rights ” so they can slowly break down each state into its own feifdom we ’re not stupid
no one cares how he performs when he ’s with a friendly crowd and a teleprompter if he ca n’t deliver on the biggest stage he ai n’t the guy
i think that is the ideal to which elections aspire however like most human made things i think they fall a little short of perfect and include some factors other than governance otherwise i have a hard time understanding how trump won in the first place besides if the majority of adjacently likeminded people around you have a different take it ’s worth paying attention because they are welcome in the ballot box to and their collective understanding has more elective power than your individual vote that in itself signals that there is more to elections than policy record also talking down to them about their understanding of elections probably wo n’t help your case much either
this i 'm so angry that they posted this now
they were counting on the dementia being hidden after last night they ca n’t call it a right wing conspiracy
good point better do jimmy carter and dick cheney
no one who needs to see that is going to when they were watching he looked like the dementia was fully onset that ’s all many people are going to need to see so the damage is done
a few days people have been in full denial about this for the past 4 years literal emperor ’s new clothes scenario that debate has incited a sincere conversation about elderly abuse ffs let the poor man retire
yeah the “ everyone chill out ” shit was for about 2 years ago this was five alarm fire nightmare stuff calling for calm is less reasonable than grabbing your shit and getting out of the building
that is a bold strategy that might just work unfortunately this is the democratic party we are talking about does that sound like something they would do
being that blatant about strategy from the horse ’s mouth would just as likely turn off those swing state voters it sounds like they ’re just malleable pawns who clap for the right person if put that way
correct the more i think about it the more gretchen whitmer stands out as the best candidate to actually win
exactly this gretchen is by far the best option if the dems want to win
yeah also i think that now the possibility of the previously unthinkable is increasing behind closed doors i believe that now we will see biden being forced out of the race by an approach
i think newsom would have a better shot than whitmer most people do n’t even know who that is and throwing her in 4 months before election day would be a bigger risk
nobody becomes vice president to an 80 year old president because they do n't want to be president
making fun of “ identity politics ” is why the democrats are doing so poorly with gen z it ’s important and frankly she ’s not popular nor is she “ diverse ” or liberal enough pete buttigieg pissed off black voters in 2020
newsom is a bad choice as conservatives and moderates have long made up their mind about him on account of representing california he 's not blameless in that he 's been shit for ca the last thing he needs is a promotion
no he pissed off black voters in the last primary
the cnbc story or the actual nyt editorial it refers to
god what a shit 8 years it has been
the new york times is calling for president joe biden to quit i wonder if he will quit the debate was the worst that any president has ever had like in history when has anyone seen the nyt saying drop out
true some people have to schedule time off work they lose money the spend money to deal with traffic they have to stand in line for hours to vote people who have to go through all that just to vote were not reassured last night that it is worth it
when push comes to shove when it comes down to fascism vs democracy they will vote for biden there are still 4 months to go keep watching
centrist democrats are as delusional as the maga folks so afraid of change or bucking tradition or god help us veering slightly left they will drive the party off a cliff and hand trump a 2nd term
biden is senile but he ’s not so old that he lacks culpability here he can still make decisions like knowing it ’s time to step down he has the agency to do the right thing here we should n’t absolve him of responsibility to do the right thing
lmfao i disagree with what i think they 're saying therefore they 're worthless 538 had the best 2016 odds for trump in the entire world at like 24 % or something you are as delusional as r conservative
seriously i do not trust nate silver
honestly having a candidate better than kamala is more valuable than that 200 million whoever the nominee is will get plenty of exposure via the media someone like newsom or whitmer could raise enough to make a campaign function
that ’s why j b pritzker would be great since he ’s already a billionaire
why have biden step aside for kamala if biden dies or ca n’t perform his duties then she becomes president anyways biden just needs to stay in trump will be sentenced soon and that will dominate the news again we ’re over four months away from the election people will forget this and he was already attacked as too old
you mean you ’re voting for trump then
i mean i hope kennedy has a shot but i doubt he does
fuck the media and the nyt the nyt was all over hillary 's emails in 2016 they screwed her over maureen dowd one of their opinion columnists literally went on a hate fest against hillary dowd was and still is a goofball tool
and one tenth of one percent saw that rally compared to those who saw the debate he blew it on the biggest stage and that 's all people will remember
the best thing he can do at this point is an unscripted town hall let half the crowd be magas if he really is n't in serious cognitive and physical decline this will be unpleasant but at least taking a few punches and not going down will at least go some way to making the debate look like a one off but does anybody actually believe biden could even do that
debates are n’t even what a president does he does n’t have to go face to face with an opponent
what is the best way to deal with a loud liar like trump
biden who is doing a great job running the country every day does n't need to apologize for being old biden did n't lose any votes being being who he has always been while convicted felon trump and his dementia addled psychosis may very well have that 's a great night
if trump is smart he does n’t agree to any more debates why would he
republicans simply do n't give a shit about trump 's convictions nor do they care about the opinion of the nyt and sane people do n't give a fuck what republicans think nor do they care about the opinion of the nyt
without biden there is no win
who is supposed to care about the new york times in 2020 they endorsed amy klobuchar and elizabeth warren over biden or sanders or pete all stronger candidates amy is one thing but warren would have gotten rocked and that 's coming from a bernie sanders supporter if the new york times says go right i 'm dodging to the left
did you see the speech he did after
this is the new york times dummies why ’re you acting like it ’s some fringe radical left paper the times is the foremost representative of stuffy elite democrats they want nothing more than another dnc controlled white house and they ’re saying they think it ’s impossible for biden to make that dream come alive
no downside the man can barely walk or form a sentence why is our country run by geriatrics
also i thought it was n’t about blind loyalty to a person it 's not it 's about loyalty to democracy and loyalty to our republic trump literally tried to overthrow his last lost election i mean we 've all already lived both of these presidents how is a single debate night going to change any of what we lived through with trump
you ever have people screaming vote blue no matter who is scary
it ’s not about being nice to biden it ’s about being realistic removing him from the ballot and installing another candidate that no one voted for is a bad look that will almost certainly hand the election to trump you claim to value not losing to trump but you seem to be arguing for the exact scenario that makes that outcome the most likely
so what are you gon na do vote for trump no and that 's the reason biden will win there is no reason not to vote for biden unless the voter is a fascist
neither is trump getting younger both are in their 70 ’s biden is 81
and that someone else would be
they also said if it comes down to it they will still endorse biden
biden won a fully competitive primary process in 2020 he has legitimacy from being selected by the people that 's democracy when someone who has never won a popular vote is installed by the party apparatus in a back room deal well that is not democracy i 'm not saying i 'm against this what i am against is naifs in the democratic party not understanding and addressing this vulnerability prior to scuttling biden
he was the stopgap the establishment candidate to get us through he was never meant to be the candidate in 24 imo it was his poor choice of a running mate who he has refused to cede his incumbent position to that has been the biggest mistake no one wants harris fuck the gop
because trump nor the republican party care what a paper like the nyt says how is this not obvious biden and the democratic party world are intertwined with institutions like the new york times
that 's what everyone including plenty of republicans were saying in 2016 whatever the political norms were prior to 2016 they do n't apply anymore at least not while donald trump is a candidate
i swear they are purposely trying to lose the election or something this is bizarre
agreed i think a swift and confident response to this issue blowing up would instill a feeling that the party is at least somewhat nimble and able to respond to the priorities of its supporters
but then it raises implications about whether biden is fit for his current office and who is really running the country if that curtain is raised the average person is n't going to be able to handle it
they shared something on tv this morning someone from the nyt basically said if biden passes the mantle than it would be something trump could never do put country above himself and his own ambitions that can be a winning message
is it really the voters saying this or just a single media platform making it look like that
the voters in the primaries who selected him or the voters in russia who elected putin
disagree the job has nothing to do with being able to debate
why should they even see this that debate was the place for biden to prove everyone wrong and he failed if this was a boxing match it only matters if your swings landed during the match it matters not if they did when you went into the gym after and landed a few good ones against the punching bag so what the amount of copium here is just off the charts but no suprise tbh
no i fully expect them to try to force harris down our throats by implying that anyone who does n't support her is racist and or misogynistic and then to spend years claiming she lost because of racism misogyny and not because she 's a shitty candidate
yeah i 'm not getting how let 's field someone who appeals to swing state voters equals swing state voters are malleable pawns but by all means let 's put someone out there we know they wo n't like and then they 'll know we do n't think they 're pawns and then they 'll surely vote for us facepalm
100 % it ’s the only person ipersonally got excited about and will bring out the independents and help michigan mentioned her to an undecided friend and they were intrigued as well i think this would be a great contrast to trump as well
they ’ll remember whitmer from the foiled paramilitary terrorist plot to kidnap her a few years back 4 months is plenty of time
killing that gorilla will ultimately have a greater impact on human history than the assassination of franz ferdinand
yeah but do you mean that you think biden will drop out not sure exactly what you meant by saying historical stuff would happen or were you just saying this in itself is historical
new york times is calling for president joe biden biden 's performance was concerning and reflected a state below the minimum needed to fulfill the presidency for another four years however he did n't lie constantly or make the disturbing comments that his opponent did if the editorial said that neither candidate was fit for office it might not have been so disappointing nyt has been overrated for decades this is just one more example
i think it 's important to distinguish that the nyt ed board wants him to drop out of the race not quit the presidency dropping out would be an important sacrifice for the country and he could dutifully fulfill his obligations until january 2025
when has anyone seen the nyt saying drop out when has anyone cared nyt has n’t been relevant for decades
editorial board having an opinion is hardly ' historical stuff '
the nyt is no longer the respectable fount of journalism that you seem to have in mind and is instead a right wing rag now so their opinion means nothing
this is the delusion that got trump elected in 2016 the people who do n’t normally vote and voted in 2020 ai n’t showing up this time
because moderates are the biggest voting block and the dnc knew joe biden was senile before they shoved him on that stage
he ’s having an rbg moment or we ’re being feinsteined
when my grandma had dementia she had moments of being lucid but i guess i forgave her for everything just due to feeling bad for her mental state
76 24 is laughable when the result was a landslide embarrassment not to mention they repeatedly got senate and house races wrong 538 had mojo back in 2006 2012 but polls became far less meaningful in 2016 it ’s not their fault the times changed and 538 could n’t keep up it ’s better to accept the truth than be in denial over it
nate silver was let go last year when disney gutted 538
because nobody will vote for a man who ca n’t form a coherent sentence
kamala has a better chance in the next debate than biden she can also pick a new vp to entice more swing voters the optics of dems saying the future of our country is at risk while running someone so clearly comprised at the top of the ticket is borderline absurd
i 'm voting for who i think is best for the country nobody is owed my vote
if he can i 'm all for it if he ca n't we need to get someone who can
but defeating trump is what this country needs right now if he ca n't win the campaign it does n't matter what he would have done as president
what about other world leaders
but the problem is this is how most people viewed it and they wo n’t vote for him now
it 's a critical part of winning elections though
putin xi yes they do much scarier ones than trump too
such a great job with checks notes lowest approval rating of any sitting president
good lord that is exactly the attitude that got trump elected in 16 almost elected in 20 and will get him elected again in november
lol borderline temper tantrum comment
thanks for gracing us from the future professor wonderful
the times editorial notes the things that trump was done that should be disqualifying the problem is that trump wo n't drop out and biden is on track to lose to him after last night 's utterly disastrous performance calling for biden to drop out does n't mean that trump should n't also drop out he should rather it 's a recognition that we need someone with a better chance of winning in an election where the stakes could n't be higher
trump wo n't listen to reason and wo n't drop out biden will and he ca n't beat trump
but you ’re not framing it right trump is their guy and has the best chance to win for them they are all insane biden is unfit and should be replaced because we do n’t want trump back the angle is pretty clear
but that ’s not their position
i would have voted for elizabeth warren everyone kept telling me she could n’t win but i still ca n’t understand why not
the man can barely walk or form a sentence compared to actively harming the country that really does n't sound that bad
because many people think 2016 2020 were better years than 2020 2024 it ’s not hard
i do n’t know why you ’re lecturing me about what trump did i ’m not planning on voting for the guy
i mean come election day i 'll generally agree with that sentiment but folks repeating that ad nauseum a full year before the election are the kinds of people that got us here in the first place with candidates who ca n't stand on their own two feet blue no matter who is an excuse to avoid demanding the dnc find more capable candidates
keeping biden in will most certainly make us lose i do n’t see how he ’s winning but keep ignoring everyone saying this and keep a man in that no one wants to vote for
lots of people and especially younger voters will sit out the election they are already unhappy about gaza so they wo n’t vote and it does n’t take many votes to change the outcome in the swing states there is no guarantee that because biden won in 2020 that he will win in 2024
calling voters names is not going to win them over this is sad
someone who can stay on topic in a debate someone who looks more energetic than trump someone who refuses to take the bait of trump 's talking points that does not describe joe biden
biden squeaked through the 2016 primary because the dnc and four of the mainstream candidates strategically dropped out stayed in to sabotage bernie sanders even then that was on the basis of biden being a one term candidate now that biden has reneged on that unwritten rule basically the entire party is reconsidering remember 67 % of democrats did n’t want biden to run for re election
it 's closer to saying the smoker with lung cancer should change plans to undergo risky emergency surgery now rather than ask the cancer to leave the body
because we all know he wo n't the editorial basically said trump is one of the greatest dangers to the free world i would argue that 's harsher to trump than telling biden to pass the mantle there 's too much at risk letting biden run
what would it matter if they told trump to step down he ’d laugh at them if the calls for biden to step down get traction he could be replaced with someone far more electable someone who can talk someone who can beat trump right now trump is going to be handed 4 more years because a lot of people do n’t have the “ i ’ll vote for a corpse ” mentality the 34 felony charges are pointless too it did n’t change how anyone feels about him were you on the fence about him before or something
anyone concerned about that is already asking questions there are always going to be people who believe obama is still running things or that jfk jr is alive and supporting trump biden dropping out of the race is not going to alter any cult member 's beliefs
that ’s what i mean it actually shows integrity and responsibility if he stepped aside something you would n’t see republicans do
go outside talk to people about last night 's debate if they watched yes biden is n't fit for office if they did n't watch their tv will be filled with clips of biden being senile soon
there are plenty of democrat leaning platforms making this call right now i think it 's the wrong one but it 's a mistake to imagine the only people saying this is the nyt 's editorial board
log off of r politics and talk to people in real life nobody is defending this
we ’ll never know because the democrats did n’t have a real primary
it has to do with confronting authoritarians around the world if he ca n’t handle trump he is going to handle xi or putin
man i feel like i 've seen this play out before
harris is second only to biden in polls vs trump anyone talking about harris being disliked is an outlier or they ’re shilling for the gop
by explicitly saying “ we picked this person to appeal to you ” you almost surely have the opposite effect it ’s almost marketing 101
i do n’t think they will and i do n’t think it is
this by itself is a big deal obviously i do n't know what happens next
after last night it ’s obviously past time for the dnc and paid tv biden pundits to put the defensive ego driven damage control spin deflect aside and ask themselves a hard q do you want to remain in power and hold the wh and senate for another 4 years or go up in flames clinging to an obviously weak candidate in nov surely biden and his handlers would prefer a legacy of dignified gracious retirement then endorsing a younger stronger better alternative rather than a humiliating loss to a convicted criminal seditious lunatic who will work to destroy that legacy and democracy itself it ’s time for his family friends to face the same facts that 70 million americans witnessed so clearly last night he ’s physically frail and mentally erratic muddled and unlikely to last another term thus it ’s unfair even dishonest to keep pretending otherwise in hopes of fooling enough voters to get re elected besides as years of polls show voters clearly are n’t buying it hopefully he will listen and do the right thing for the sake of the country and party if not then it ’s fair to pressure him out the way the gop forced nixon to resign over watergate and the dems forced lbj to not run because he would lose over vietnam
how is losing the popular vote by millions but winning the ec by like 30 000 a landslide and they were basically spot on in 2018 2020 2022
you should watch his speech from today he ’s sharp and fiery
if that were the case i ’d write in elizabeth warren it ’s nice to fantasize but more important to live in reality a vote for third party is a vote for trump
he has four years of real results there
i disagree we ’re four months from the election and trump is about to get sentenced this will blow over biden ’s speech today was fiery and well spoken
so biden voters are going to embrace a trumpian dictatorship because biden had a shit debate biden prob has a better chance than harris even now and he can step down any time if he wins should he have declared a one term presidency and endorsed another candidate probably but here we are
undecided voters are behind biden after the debate
then you ’ve got your head in the sand her polling number were always awful she barely finished ahead of michael bloomberg who she eviscerated in five minutes on the debate stage that ’s how inherently unlikeable she apparently is 7 7 % to 6 9 % in the democratic primaries in 2020
yes lmao what ’re you talking about neither democrats nor republicans have ever given a shit about iraq it ’s a leftist issue not a liberal one “ the same elite democrats who backed the thing which the majority of democrats backed ”
it ’s possible no doubt but removing him and installing a new candidate that no one voted for is even more likely to make us lose
step down because he 's senile and needs to be in hospice
it is not even that fucking easy step down for a bloodbath backwater deal between 2 governors and an unpopular vp i wish it was as easy as a solid solid solid 2 instead we would only get a civil war
the new york times is a republican psyop absolute democrat brainworms it ’s like the republicans calling mike pence a communist
i mean this an interesting story but it 's all conjecture i am a sanders supporter voted for him twice but biden won the primary and became the legitimate democratic party candidate for president the one term candidate thing was all speculation from outsiders neither biden nor anyone in his inner circle ever said this to now say that he ' reneged ' is uh a stretch to put it mildly
you absolutely should not waste resources doing shit just to do it but that 's besides the point because the nyt editorial board literally published a piece this year warning the public about how dangerous trump is a warning about donald trump and 2024 i think you should be aware your brazen cope false equivelancies are contributing to the crisis in the democratic party and not helping it just demonstrates you have n't been paying much attention and playing the partisan game just like the other side
this is a wild take so a newspaper should only bother saying the right thing if it 's targeted at someone and they hope to affect their desired change they should just shrug at trump because well the gop is n't listening so let 's make a huge logical leap because maybe the dnc is listening just wild stuff and i worry you deeply misunderstand the role of the fourth estate literally every day in a paper like the new york times there are stories about how awful trump is it 's moot and goes without saying that the editorial board of the nyt is anti trump and therefore would support him dropping out there 's a reason they endorse democratic candidates for president and not republicans this is significant because a significant amount of biden supporters and donors are highly educated wealthier voters exactly the audience of the nyt they 're putting this out there because they have influence in the democratic party and they have absolutely 0 influence in the republican party
i 'm scared this is rbg 2 0
it seems like most voters do n’t like either candidate to me
kamala ’s problem is as my son put it is she “ has the charisma of a prostate exam ”
yeah that ' s name recognition i would n't mistake that for enthusiastic support and enthusiastic support is what we need americans had a good look at harris in 2020 and were n't impressed
if it would have the opposite effect then swing state voters are malleable pawns i do n't think that 's true at all i do think if there 's a candidate who rates highly with swing state voters on the ever popular but ill defined shares our values the dem party would do well to consider them
sorry for asking something so dumb
dems are circling the wagons now and will hand your fate over to trump good luck
the popular vote does n’t matter in an electoral college it ’s a moot point i like how the first insight on that page is “ on aug 14 2016 we gave donald trump a 6 percent chance of winning michigan he won ”
okay this was the same stuff shoveled on in 2016 without realizing the problem is n't the voter it 's the candidates
the fact your dream candidate is the racist white lady who pretended to be an indigenous american to advance her career makes all your political opinions worthless
yeah this is n't going to blow over look at what voters are needed to win the election in the key battle ground states they 're unengaged not likely to consume lots of media about the election but they will tune into a presidential debate i would love to see some very targeted and specific polling for this group but my gut is they were on the fence heard about biden age concerns and had them confirmed last night they do n't care that donald lied through his teeth all politicians lie but biden looked old looked worn out and just could n't stand up to trump at all the first 10 mins lost the election for those voters anyone trying to say different is wishful thinking
trump getting sentenced is not going to cause him to lose voters lol
no it was n’t he coughed like he was dying he slurred his words and yelled like an 81 year old psych patient
he had a 50 50 chance before the debate it ’s probably much worse now
given the choice they would not have trump in the race it does n’t need to be explicitly stated because they explain how he is incredibly dangerous for democracy in fact they specifically stated they will still be endorsing biden if it comes down to it not sure why you ’re stuck on this pedantic take where you incorrectly inferred their position on trump
i just do n’t understand why though she had a complete plan for the economy education funding reform healthcare and plenty to offer after bernie she was my second choice
that ’s persons so dumb “ the same newspaper that serves the inserts of the elites ”
based on what something biden ’s campaign said lol
i hope the dnc figures it out and soon
harris is second only to biden in polls vs trump anyone talking about harris being disliked is not a member of the mainstream democratic party
charisma is a personality trait valued by preachers salesmen and followers anybody can tell you what you want to hear and some are lucky enough to look good doing it that ’s your son ’s bar for a world leader
“ considering them ” and “ telling the truth as to why they ’re picked ” which again sounds like explicitly saying “ we picked them to make you happy ” are two different things considering them for that reason is what the parties are doing all the time it ’s what the pundits will discuss but the party saying “ we did this to make you happy ” out front will turn people off not win them over
and who do you think would beat trump show your work
that is literally labelled the biggest surprise of the entire presidential data set
the problem was people like you failing to see the massive difference between a decent candidate and trump
boston globe investigated it and found she did not benefit from her native claim and she was told that growing up by her parents this was before dna tests and she does have some native blood but keep buying lazy narratives
biggest climate change bill ever biggest gun reform in over two decades capped price of insulin unprecedented student loan forgiveness booming economy with lower inflation than most other countries chips act infrastructure bill united world against putin invading europe
i ’ll vote for a corpse before i vote for a fascist i just wish i did n’t have to
so what you ’re saying is as usual republicans can run dumpster fires for any office but democrats have to be perfect 100 % of the time he had one bad really bad night after proving for the last three that he ’s been the most effective president in decades allow that to fucking sink in we are willing to give up democracy on the off chance that a single nights performance would do more damage than changing candidates months before the election
hard disagree did you even watch it he was full of energy and very sharp
based on the fact that voters tend to dislike when you subvert democracy to install a candidate no one voted for democratic voters anyways people got so upset that superdelegates were behind hillary now imagine the dnc says “ fuck you ” to every dem voter and installs a candidate no one voted for imagine if they were to remove biden and install hillary again you do n’t think voters would be upset well it does n’t matter who they install it ’s going to piss off voters
and they ’re saying let him die so the democrats can win the battle the new york times is the most esteemed media outlet of liberal elites denying that is just idiotic
so we should pick candidates that appeal to swing state voters but not admit it it 's no secret that both parties compete for the support of swing state voters it 's not going to be a shocking revelation that a candidate 's ability inability to tip the scales in our favor in some states was a deciding factor
1 biden is all set to lose swing state data had trump ahead pre debate there 's plenty of data showing major concern in the electorate at large about biden 's age last night just intensifies that greatly 2 any mainstream candidate would at least have a better chance than him maybe a much better one people do n't like trump either double haters a good % of those people would be happy to vote for a younger coherent alternative 3 there 's also down ticket ballots to consider dems gaslighting the public that biden is actually ok could turn some people off of voting i mean fundamentally we 're all screwed regardless of this election with the way the world is but trump would accelerate our downfall
the man on that stage last night did n't know where he was half of the debate that 's not a decent candidate one candidate is senile one is an authoritarian ass hat forgive me for not liking the fact i 'm being told to eat a shit sandwich on both plates
typical centrist white man trying to whitesplain shit to a woman of color if she did n't think she 'd benefit from the claims she would n't have made them and having an ancestor 6 to 10 generations back who was indegionous does n't mean anything at all there 's a reason the cherokee nation demanded an apology and if you are still siding with the lying rich white woman over the actual native population then you are just another racist in liberal clothing
but the topic was his ability to go toe to toe against world leaders you provided a list of things that you feel are accomplishments but said nothing about his successes in negotiating with other world leaders
getting dommed by netanyahu for the last 8 months
yeah russia is gon na withdraw any day now buddy
there have been numerous instances like it this year and when they were pointed out they were called deep fakes conspiracy theories and misleading we were called trumpies and downvoted listen dr jill had to lead that rally last night while joe stared into space fact
if you think the issue is that biden is n’t perfect you have n’t been paying attention and i do n’t care about being nice to biden i do n’t want a second term of trump i wo n’t be able to survive that
have you not seen the polls convicting trump on the new york charges plays into his narrative and will not cost him any votes that actually matter
i ’m sorry i just do n’t see him being that sharp still slurs his words squints off this stare it ’s like the proper mechanics are there but not the consciousness he is compensating by saying more edgier phrasing vigorously hate to say it but 3 years down the line he is n’t gon na be walking to the podium anymore this dude needs to retire we need younger youthful leaders i would have so much respect for him and the party if he faced the reality of the situation and dropped out making him and his party self aware is so important right now
i did watch it the entire thing his voice was louder for sure but he kept mumbling at times and he did that thing again where he insinuated that his son died in combat the crowd was clearly coached or managed because every time he started joeing out the crowd would start chanting “ four more years ” the crowd to joes delight and encouragement also chanted “ lock him up ” i have it on good authority from all my leftist friends that chants such as that are indicative of fascism and are threats to democracy i ’m done having conversations with people who say joe is mentally capable for the job americans hate being gaslighted and that ’s just what the democratic party and corporate media has done regarding joe ’s mental fitness it ’s joever
just pointing out that the account you 're arguing with is less than 24 hours old and 95 % of its comments are about biden 's age might not want to waste your time with this one edit account is 2 months old but started commenting 24 hours ago
sorry a group of latino voters changing their minds is n’t very convincing to me
the dnc did n’t have a primary so what are you talking about that people voted for him lol
kind of yeah again even a marketing 101 class would tell you that being so brazen and blatant about your motivation to appeal to a consumer or voter base would have the opposite effect that ’s what the pundit class is for
the brazen manipulation and gaslighting is what 's getting to me i 've never seen such a thinly veined brutish attempt at dictating thoughts
none of that is what i asked who do you think would best trump
he looked very energetic and sharp today in his speech
let me say this again she was told by her parents that she had native blood this was before dna tests
without american help they would ’ve taken over ukraine by now
dr jill had to lead that rally last night while joe stared into space fact god that was so sad watching that
biden has been a very effective leader against a hostile congress and treasonous supreme court he ’s got my vote even if he appears old look at his record he ’s the first president in 40 years to start moving us away from trickle down economics for the first time in decades we have a sustained albeit tiny increase in wages over inflation it will take years for that to be felt by the average person but if the huge ship of the united states has started turning the right direction you stay with the person steering it you do n’t just give up
dropping out makes no sense it would have to be kamala or the dnc would splinter the voter base if they put a newsome in and kamala would take over anyways if biden seriously became too old or died he just needs to stay in he already beat trump once now trump is a felon found liable for sexual assault instigated jan 6 and roe v wade has enflamed the democrats
four years of good results
thanks i feel like half the people i talk to are trolls or bots part of the reason i continue is for everyone else that reads it
people voted for him in 2020 him running again as the incumbent was part of the discussion at the time and was taken into consideration by voters when they voted for him in the primary there ’s a reason he won the primary he ’s the candidate voters wanted installing someone else would almost certainly be putting forward a candidate that fewer voters want and it will alienate the people who still support him it ’s a guaranteed losing strategy
gretchen whitmer raphael warnock hell even gavin newsom would have a good shot
i ’m pretty sure he said “ any mainstream candidate ”
genuinely at this point kamala polls marginally better than him as for all the other candidates bandied around newsom buttigieg whitmer pritzker etc it ’s true that they do n’t have the same familiarity among the general electorate biden has but that could work in their favor they might poll closer to the “ generic democrat ” baseline
yes senile people do better earlier in the day that 's part of it
do you think the likelihood of ukraine retaking its lost territory is high enough to avoid negotiations and i do have to acknowledge how over half of the foreign policy wins of biden you listed are just domestic programs
cool what was the point of saying that to me i ’m not someone you need to convince to vote for him
what good results housing has quadrupled groceries up 30 % 9 million more illegals weaponization of our justice system synagogues attacked heartbreaking disaster with the afghanistan withdrawal putin unchecked a trillion in deficit spending every 90 days a corpse for a president at what point do you start to acknowledge you ’re in a cult he has the lowest approval rating of any president in history a whopping 82 % of americans do n’t want him to run we wo n’t survive another four years of “ good results ”
yeah there 's no doubt that the bots are going all in on this one it 's literally the only thing they have on biden and this seems their best chance to make it stick anyway i appreciate your efforts it is important to counter this nonsense
someone winning a primary 4 years ago is n’t relevant to them running now and you ca n’t use that to say that people would have their votes canceled out and be mad about it what kind of pretzel logic is this lmao
america has n’t been 1 at anything in decades other than military power and mutual anger at life there ’s no reason to be a better national when you can just wallow in your own misery merica
meanwhile china 's r d spending is growing dramatically granted they still have a lot of issues with quality but they will eventually get those cleared up
who needs science when we have feelings and identity
not sure why this is n’t at the top of the page
that ’s where generations of teaching kids american exceptionalism has hurt us the most too much emphasis learning about that great thing we did 50 60 years ago while being assured it would carry us forever cause we ’re special now those many of those folk look at you like you just blasphemed if you mention we ’re falling behind in some area they ca n’t wrap their heads around it even as our aging infrastructure crumbles around them
and anger that science is so woke
do n't pretend he 's not responsible
four years of increased spending post trump then 1 year of decline is somehow trump 's fault letting the blue leaders get away with this by blaming trump makes our country worse
starts 2 weeks before ovulation and fertilization 6 weeks gestational age is before the first missed period this is a total abortion ban
so if you are wealthy you can afford ivf and discard unhealthy embryos and do genetic screening if you are poor you ca n't do genetic screening and have to carry to term why do republicans hate the poor and middle class so much
at 6 weeks it looks like a spot of white mold 7 mm in diameter this is ridiculous
no surprise here iowa republicans have been rebuilding the iowa sc for this specific purpose fortunately for iowa women minnesota illinois and nebraska yes nebraska have more permissive abortion laws it may swing one or two state legislative seats but the rs have roughly 2 1 advantages so a couple seats do n't matter
they still wipe their butts with corn cobs in iowa
there aught to be a law that all boys at the age of 10 must have a vasectomy
this country is not as liberal as the obama coalition would like to believe more proof positive
well i 'll go with the title where do things stand with the 2024 election and what could happen next
the wsj ’s top headline is “ democrats privately discuss replacing biden ” who would likely take the conversation public what would that announcement look like is everything likely to remain “ private ” until biden himself announces a decision to step down
how feasible is it really at this stage for biden to be replaced with a new candidate for president
how can america realistically implement ranked choice voting the parties are so entrenched that they do n't care what the average person thinks i do n't expect things to change for this year 's election but it would be nice to have more viable options and this year proves that more thoroughly than any other election cycle note i expect that both parties would fight this tooth and nail the rnc and dnc do n't want to give up an ounce of power which is one more reason why it needs to be done and why it ca n't be done legislatively
i 'm curious as to the importance of gavin newsoms ' inclusion to the debate previously he debated ron desantis in what seemed like a mock presidential debate thought it was clearly a last ditch effort for desantis to defend himself against any democrat to gain traction with the republican party and ultimately against trump and seems to have a great deal of things to say about being president is gavin newsom being included as a standard bearer of the democratic party or is he attempting to vie for the presidency
notice that this murdoch employee does not mention trump 's blizzard of lies
are democrats in washington seriously considering looking for a way to replace biden are there conversations happening around this the dems need a stronger candidate
why is the media intent on hurting america in exchange for ratings views clicks why allow people to peddle lies and self interest instead of fact checking and actually researching claims
is it your responsibility as a journalist to keep power accountable if so why has there been so little reporting about the incredible amount of lies and misinformation being supplied by trump even though he talked louder and has a fake tan will you at the wall street journal stand up and protect democracy not through both side narratives but by honest reporting of what the candidates would mean for the country if elected
have you ever seen anything like this does n't need to be at a national level how does what we saw compare to regan 's second term
why did n't the press report widely on the fact that trump lied about almost every claim he made instead they reported on biden 's halting performance without acknowledging that he was debating with a sore throat
explain why no one in the media is talking about trump basically giving up on the ukraine war in favor talking about of biden ’s stuttering trump literally said our ally can not win the implication being he will let them lose
why does the wsj work so hard to promote extremist right wing agendas
do you think it likely that there will be further debates i imagine that biden would look for opportunities to make up for last night 's poor showing but every debate now poses a serious risk as anything other than a very strong performance would further feed into the now very dominant opinion that old age has caught up with him
as someone not from the united states but aware of the importance of specific swing states in deciding the election as opposed to the national popular vote is the biden campaign facing a potential death spiral from my understanding he was already trailing in the major swing states and after last night ’s performance it ’s unlikely to get better if anything the gap might tend to widen what are the potential ways for biden to turn this around or does he have to hope for external factors like trump ’s legal woes as someone to the left of american politics this looks like it could be a dangerous election to not win for the dems in terms of democracy for the united states edit i ’m not even asking about trump and fact checking his constant lies because that ’s something that seemingly is not possible to be done in real time i ’m concerned about the sitting president and how he can ensure his campaign continues
i 'm not sure why it 's even a question of who to support our choices are between someone who occasionally struggles to answer questions but is well intentioned or someone who will outright lie about everything and who wants to be a day 1 dictator why are we pretending like trump is even close to being a moral or better choice
the biden campaign is pretending that he did a good job last night what do you think is actually going on within the biden campaign
why did the moderators refuse to moderate
thank you for doing this in your opinion how serious has the conversation been around a transition to another candidate there ’s a lot of speculation from the outside but that does n’t mean much if it did come to that would you see a kamala harris run or another center left candidate like whitmer or shapiro do you think there ’s any evidence to the kind of wacky conspiracy that this concern has been brewing for a while and because the debate was biden ’s team ’s idea that it was insiders forcing the issue as early as possible you might not be able to answer this but i feel like his cognitive decline has been there for everyone to see over the last few years but there ’s been a collective denial of it in order not to cede ground to the other party i was wondering what your thoughts were on this thanks again signed a concerned center left democrat who has been really impressed with the biden administration and incredibly concerned about biden himself
hey guys ask me anything i just wo n't answer 80 % of them and of those that i answer half of them will be thinly veiled plugs link and all for my absolute rag of a newspaper
who can even talk to biden about how he truly did
if president biden does end up withdrawing from the 2024 ticket is it feasible for democrats to nominate someone other than kamala harris without causing severe rifts in the party base
given all things in and commenting on biden why is trumps lies and rants allowed to go unquestioned there is more than enough computer power in the world to handle both discussions
legit question what happens if either one of these extremely old candidates dies of natural causes before the election do their running mates auto get selected or is there a more nuanced process
should n't there be a stronger focus on how one debater said very little of substance and very many false and inflammatory statements why is n't that just as bad
hi what are the odds of an open convention after last night are there any legal dem party hoops that need to be jumped to make this possible
my question is this what 's the point of debates like really i know the media loves them for the show but realistically they have absolutely nothing in common with actually doing the job i 'm pretty confident that i could have beaten either of these clowns when i was 15 on the high school debate team but 15 year old me would have made for an exceptionally poor administrator of the world 's biggest economy
i watched the debate and was panicked in the first 20 minutes with bidens low energy and confusion but as it went on trumps lying just got to me and i found biden to be better i was unhappy that the cnn panel was so negative do youthink they were feeding off the negative energy of their social media contacts and did n't have ample time to reflect on the outcome i thought it was a knee jerk over reaction and harris interview with cooper confirmed it
we want to hear from you what questions do you have coming out of the debate why is biden the big story and not how trump accused democrats of murdering children or how everything he said was a lie how he has n't changed his rhetoric from his extremist nazi rallies at all when speaking to the general public
not to be purposely gross but a little over 2 hours into the debate trump audibly sharted only his mike was open so it was absolutely him who lost control of his bowels on stage why is n't anyone pointing this out during this loud questioning of biden 's fitness biden is n't the one wearing diapers and sharting himself
i read that unless biden or harris are on the ticket all money and resources the campaign has can not be used for a replacement democrat can you speak on this and how big of an obstacle would this be to the idea that biden can be replaced with only a few months to go
i had the debate on in the background when i was making dinner i swear i heard them boomerdrop “ the blacks ” did i mishear
why are you and the rest is the msm focusing so much on biden ’s age instead of all the glaring lies and threats to democracy trump was spewing
why does the media just not also hammer trump for his age it ’s a three year difference but why does biden get the short end of the stick on this topic
why did everybody freak out over biden being old and quiet when the actual substance of his performance was pretty standard and not very alarming
in the uk replacing your candidate this late on would be suicide and would give the opposition an open goal would it be as frowned upon in the us cheers
do you think it 's likely biden will dropout who do you think would be best to replace him
what options are there for replacing biden as the candidate does he have to willingly step down himself additionally i ’ve seen plenty of people calling for x and y as the replacement but how would one of them actually get chosen without a primary would the dnc just have to choose one
what percentage of prominent democrats that you are aware of are actually in favor of replacing biden at this point
so did you come from a upper middle class wealthy family i notice journalists are rarely ever from the working class anymore it shows in your news coverage
not seeing this talked about much but what are your thoughts on biden sounding less hoarse and more energetic during the post debate speech and next day what are your thoughts on this it ’s insane to me how much different and better biden sounds during the post debate speech or the next day after debate speech next day at first i thought it ’s the late nature of the debate but at 11 pm the same night this voice is clearer and less hoarse and he has more energy more volume and the next day he sounds much better crazy how different he sounds if it ’s the cold symptoms during the debate that ’s really unlucky timing
do you think trump actually has a shit at winning i just do n't see how he can win her barley win in 2016 and he is less popular now then ever
is the wsj for a convicted felon and traitor who clearly has dementia being president of the united states
is being a politics reporter like you thought it would be what has surprised you about the job
question about mainstream media 's collusion biden 's decline did n't happen overnight so why did the mainstream media run cover prior to the debate and what was the deciding factor to change this course and why not closer to the convention also who tipped off charlie kirk last week leading him to be ready for a july surprise very possible they pull biden and sentence trump to prison on july 11 the entire race could be just about to change
what role do you think the media plays in the doomerism that is rampant after last nights debate i 'm my opinion all of these will biden step down dems are panicking seem to just be clickbait bs to squeeze out revenue
do you think there is a real chance biden will be replaced prior to the election
obviously we have seen plenty of speculation in the media about whether biden should drop out and be replaced by another candidate do you think that behind closed doors there are will be people directly pressuring biden to do that or if it were to happen as unlikely as that may be would it be entirely his decision
how are the post debate poll numbers looking among important democrat demographics like african americans latinos etc
biden stuttered and mispoke throughout his state of the union speech which the media and viewers declared was a victory why do you think people viewed his debate performance as such a disaster when arguably the same challenges with biden speaking were apparent in both events
what sorts of things are democratic officials telling you off the record that might surprise people after the debate performance are there things you 've never heard before being said or unprecedented actions being considered
there 's no age cap in the u s constitution to become president but can the democratic or republican parties institute one say 70 years old at the time of the election
can we get rid of the entire government and start over please
hi there as an eternal optimist this debate and the whole discourse about this it makes me feel sad and i have a lot of questions about this forgive me if this is long winded i am sorry why do you think that there is so much pessimism and hopelessness about this and why are so many calling it the death of democracy even though we are nowhere near november yet is it too early to say why do people turn to such pessimism in times like this also what do you think about these people saying that the media is wanting for trump to return and that they are playing a part in enabling him any counterpoints
so like what happened i 'm seeing from commemts here and an article in the nytimes about his just today that biden seems to be much more vigorous and performing better now i mean it 's only been a day but what is the explanation for what happened was he tired is he ill what on earth i hear the campaign leaked that he had a cold but it was clearly a bigger deal than that
where is your boy samuel alito
can biden either back out of the next debate or change the rules specific rule change that needs to be made have a live real time fact checker during the debate on msnbc an expert on authoritianism said that even if a skill dem candidate debater such as candidate x debated djt he would have spent all his time fact checking and not presenting his vision of america 's future thank you
does bernie still have a chance
anyone wanting to look at transcription for the presidential debate
political parties are n't sports
i want biden to step down and release the delegates to choose a new candidate what can i do to make my voice heard
why is biden running for a second term when he himself realizes he does n't lead and debate and walk as well as he used to he has enough money i presume to see him through retirement is it hunter and keeping him as safe as possible
smart questions if i do say so myself before the debate trump appeared to be slightly ahead of biden leading in almost all of the key swing states biden was still within striking distance though we ’ll all be paying special attention to the post debate polls which will start coming out very soon if even democrats are saying biden ’s night was a mess which they are then it ca n’t help his polling trump did n’t have a dominant performance but contrasted with biden side by side on the stage it helped trump tremendously because biden could n’t effectively attack what could happen next 1 fundraisers could flee causing panic and forcing democrats to decide whether to try and nudge biden off the ticket 2 trump ’s supreme court ruling on immunity monday could change the focus back to his legal problems 3 the race could slip further from biden ’s reach 4 he could mount a massive comeback
great question if it goes in that direction which is a big if the most likely scenario is people close to him would encourage him to consider stepping aside and then only go public if he refused and they felt they had to it would be an incredible moment this all seems unlikely but last night seemed unlikely too
i feel like pulling your candidate 4 months before the election would usually be like shooting yourself in the foot but with how unpopular both biden and trump are it seems more like the country is begging for literally anyone else that is n't a nutjob like kennedy at the same time anyone who might have an actual shot like newsom or whitmer might not want a potential loss to trump to be on their resume should they choose to run in 2028 and would ideally prefer a full length campaign so who the hell knows i think we 're really in unprecedented times looking at the 2020 primary candidates does n't instill a ton of hope either bernie is cool but replacing an old guy for an old guy does n't seem like a smart choice warren is n't in the spotlight in 2024 as much as she was 4 years ago and i 'm not sure if the country is willing to vote in a gay guy with buttigieg and going even further back john kerry is also 80 al gore is only 76 though so progress does n't ohio also have a ballot deadline that the party would be fighting against
i would say it is feasible yes is it likely no but last night was n’t likely either democrats will have to decide fairly quickly what to do if they are going to replace biden he ’ll essentially have to step aside it would take a tremendous effort to rapidly unify the democratic party behind a single candidate at this stage and not have the party splinter into numerous camps but they might not have a choice they ’ll know in the coming days how much damage occurred during the debate if fundraising dries up quickly they ’ve got a big problem so far it does n’t appear that happened but time will tell
this is the only question i find compelling at this point the dnc handed trump 2016 by forcing hillary on everyone now they are doing the exact same thing
that sure is the million dollar question it feels like either option is less than ideal
why would we need another candidate biden has been doing great all these years what have republicans offered at all revenge victimhood
unless the dems want to hand trump a second term they ’d best keep biden with incumbent advantage and avoiding a party nomination contest not to mention pissing off primary voters whose votes would be thrown away
wsj is rupert murdoch 's rag and here we are asking for advice from them classic
i honestly ca n't see it happening with out him stepping down if the democrats replace or are thoughts to forcibly replace him it would destroy people 's faith in the party not like many people really respected them after bernie sanders but for it to be said democrats disregard primary results would be bad their super delegate situation already feels like that to many people that being said i also wonder if this has happened in november would everyone have still voted for him in the primary yeah he really was n't running against anyone but i feel like he would have had more competition very likely newsom would have been nominated not saying he 's a great pick but probably the easiest second the democratic party pool is almost as shallow as the republican party
100 % he will be replaced with trump
for those interested here are a couple of maps showing which states have rcv and to what degree and which states have banned it where is rcv used
he 's trying to be seen as a loyal soldier and valuable asset to the party he wants his name to be in people 's minds when they starting looking around for the next president not sure he thought it might happen this quickly
great point newsom has been really forceful in his defense of biden before and after the debate he has been very willing to step in and trade blows with republicans and defend a more liberal agenda his ascent is very notable and worth watching
i feel like gavin has been a plan b for awhile now i think they do n't have confidence in kamala and to be frank she seems like she 's high on something half the time i do n't know what her deal is if they had picked a charismatic person for vp in 2020 then this would have been a clear choice even if biden was on the ticket people would say yeah he might die but insert charismatic and well loved vp would be president so that 's okay but it 's not the case i would n't be shocked if we end up with gavin running
the timing of the debate is certainly not ideal for democrats biden performed very well during the state of the union speech in march he surprised voters and republicans leading to a feeling that he was ready to spring across the finish line in november here was a headline from peggy noonan on the editorial page state of the union shows there 's life in the old boy yet so several months ago when the primaries were still ongoing and there might have been time to rush another candidate besides dean phillips or rfk jr into the mix biden looked stronger now the primary season is effectively over that makes the process more complicated if democrats decide they want another candidate
what about this argument 1 a debate is not a cheap entertainment ploy for clicks it ’s a tradition in us presidential elections and 2 it ’s biden ’s job to challenge trump on the lies in real time cnn did a huge fact check after the debate but it was biden ’s job to call trump out
good luck getting wsj to answer this truthfully lmao
this is what really pisses me off i understand freedom of the press is very important but there is a difference between the government not going after the media for telling the truth and holding the media accountable when it tries to lie
capitalism what industry has n't at some point tried to manipulate or actively harm customers for more profit energy companies tobacco guns telecom monopolies pharma predatory lending factory work predatory food sales list goes on and on why would media be different
it 's biden 's job to fact check trump not the moderators the moderators are there to pose questions and ensure candidates adhere to the rules the substance of the debate is on the candidates
because they are being roasted alive by distraction culture and will do anything to compete with tiktok and mr beast
very interesting question i need to watch reagan ’s debates more closely during his second term when there were rumors about reagan battling dementia he did n’t spend as much time ad libbing in the public view aides shielded him from scrutiny quite a lot biden tends to be out and about but he frequently stays on script or uses a teleprompter biden seems to be incredibly comfortable mixing it up with the crowd talking to people and being himself and that has n't changed he actually just delivered a fiery speech a few minutes ago but during the debate he was low energy and at times looked lost that image will stay with people for a while
no i do n’t think there will be another debate trump has no reason to debate biden unless trump stumbles badly or his legal problems force him to need to shake up the race in some way
biden was 100 % improved at the waffle house event after the debate i 'm not sure what happened in between
debates are over now it 's time for voters to decide
great questions biden has been running a very controlled campaign he has been mostly holding events that are closed to the public he works off of teleprompters he does n't do many media interviews he does n't even meet as much as he used to with lawmakers on capitol hill he probably needs to change the script that could mean doing impromptu interviews putting himself out there more he needs to show americans that he is n't the same person that they saw during the debate and he might have to do it again and again
as someone not from the united states but aware of the importance of specific swing states in deciding the election as opposed to the national popular vote i talked about this in a comment on another subreddit trump is winning each of those states in the polls albeit by a small margin this is really the democrat 's only opening everywhere else that is n't a safe democrat state trump is absolutely destroying the poll averages and the democrats need all three no realistic combination of states can replace even a single loss in the great lakes states you can play around with the map here if you want if the debate only keeps the poll numbers the same assuming the polls are accurate trump totally wins the election what are the potential ways for biden to turn this around or does he have to hope for external factors like trump ’s legal woes 1 do better on the second debate also hope kamala harris does good in the vice presidential debate 2 hope for some sort of external factor but even then at this point i do n't know what that might be
by swing state trump has a small lead in arizona fair lead in georgia and nevada biden has a fair lead in new mexico colorado the fake electors trials will impact swing states significantly that 's what i would keep an eye out for trials wo n't happen this year but there 's evidence that will likely come out as there are already been a few plea deals made as of this elector cases have been filed in five states michigan and georgia went first last summer nevada followed in december arizona and wisconsin filed charges this year the georgia prosecution is the only one to directly implicate trump it ’s also the only case so far that has led to guilty pleas to date four of the original 19 defendants have entered pleas the arizona case 18 people were charged with conspiracy fraud and forgery including top current and former trump aides like mark meadows the former chief of staff rudy giuliani a former trump lawyer wisconsin brought charges earlier this month and was the only state that did n’t charge any fake electors at all focusing instead on trump campaign advisers
from a very basic perspective i 'd say mostly because this is our country 's pinnacle of a leadership position and the top candidates ca n't maintain a train of thought or speak clearly therefore it is really confusing as to why we 're presented with these two choices
i think taco bell has made it pretty clear america do n't care about morals
because the debate was n’t to gain your support it was to gain support of undecided and it ’s very likely last night ’s disaster turned undecided into decided
i agree the choices are between a convicted felon with more criminal trials pending who was found liable for sexual assault bungled our covid response to be one of the worst hit despite our head start sent armed angry mob to congress to overthrow democracy and pushed a plot to have fake votes counted who will stack the supreme court even more conservative and kill so many things we hold dear and will accelerate climate change versus a guy who had the biggest climate change bill ever biggest gun reform in over two decades infrastructure passed capped price of insulin billions in student loans forgiven and oh he ’s three years older and stumbled on a dozen words last night
the way you are framing this it does n't matter we can complain about a double standard it 's unfair etc we just have to beat trump and at this point i think biden lost his already wobbly chances to do so as risky as it is and i 'm normally cautious i think we are better off taking our chances with a new candidate it 's too bad this did n't happen earlier but we ca n't change history my guess is that right now biden has about a 30 % chance of winning it was maybe 45 % before the debate i think a different democrat might have a 50 50 shot against trump maybe even better than 50 % a new democrat would i hope be 20 30 years younger and not carry the inflation baggage biden has so many voters are upset about the choice between two old candidates the democrats putting in an energetic 50 something against doddering trump would give us a chance to win that we lost last night with biden 's performance
i feel like i 'm going crazy reading these just be positive comments it was a fucking catastrophe biden especially at the beginning when most viewers were tuned it looked legitimately minutes from death and the idea that he 's even being considered is flat out insane we are walking into not just into a trump victory but a trump landslide that will make 2016 look like a joke
thank you i made myself watch the whole thing and the only comfort i could find was the thought that now they are forced to consider replacing him but this morning the world is full of gaslighting denial about how bad he did his answers were”quiet but clear “ he lost the plot on multiple questions i love biden and i love so many things he ’s done but he is finished if he stays in the race trump wins full stop
a lot of resume polishing and calls to newsom ’s advisors
you sound like a journalist those are the exact questions were are working around the clock to answer for you
yes is there anyone in there that will tell it how it is to joe or is he in a bubble of ass kissers
cnn has defended the performance of the moderators jake tapper and dana bash it 's a difficult balancing act knowing when to step in and when to let the candidates debate there were several occasions when trump skirted a question one in particular about russia and another about jan 6 when the moderators followed up to put him on the record those led to quite newsy moments
they cut both biden and trump ’s mics at appropriate times what would you have them do
it 's the candidates ' job to fact check each other not the moderators the moderators are there to pose questions and ensure candidates adhere to the rules the substance of the debate is on the candidates
this was part of the agreed to rules opponents are meant to take each other to task with their debate statements not moderators the moderators are n't running
i wo n't express an opinion here because i honestly do n't know i do believe that anything is possible they do still have time to make a change if that 's what they decide they must do but the decision really has to be biden 's re his acuity i 'll share our story from a few weeks ago edit for free link
why are you thanking him he 's from the wall street journal they 're not rooting for democrats they 're rooting against them all this bullshit about replacing biden weakens biden 's chances and whoever is typing these answers knows that this entire conversation is bad faith nonsense and i 'm surprised so many people on r politics are falling for it
his family and close aides but he just held a rally an hour or so ago and looked like a completely different person full of energy and spunk so maybe he just had a bad night the problem is it was a bad night to have a bad night
replacing biden with someone besides vp harris at the top of the ticket would be a very difficult thing for democrats to do but it ’s also very possible that the party might try to do that coordinating this all behind closed doors would be fraught
biden had plenty of opportunities to push back on trump ’s bullshit he should n’t be excused for that either
yes many hoops but the odds are not zero edit with free link
a little over 2 hours into the debate was n't the debate only 90 minutes long
according to the cnn transcript here is what trump said he caused inflation as sure as you ’re sitting there the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he ’s allowed to come in through the border they ’re taking black jobs now and it could be 18 it could be 19 and even 20 million people they ’re taking black jobs and they ’re taking hispanic jobs and you have n’t seen it yet but you ’re going to see something that ’s going to be the worst in our history he also said re opportunity zones it ’s one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country opportunity zones and the biggest beneficiary are blacks
because trump is great for their bottom line
biden is the president the wall street journal wrote an incredibly comprehensive story earlier this month about his acuity and his performance behind closed doors we also cover trump very comprehensively as well it was the wsj after all that broke the stormy daniels story
because they want trump to win so they can get their clicks and tax breaks
i am but a simpleton and not the wsj but i 'd say it 's because in american politics it 's all about optics the average american voter could care less about the ins and outs of the policies that a candidate presents they just care how you look while you say stuff biden looked like a frail and weak old man trump was just his usual self boastful non stop word salad filled with misinformation and insults unfortunately though all the voter saw was a confident trump and a seemingly weak biden
not very alarming the first twenty minutes of the debate were the most comprehensively disqualifying performance of any debate i have seen in my lifetime
this is a very thoughtful question first of all i would say the substance of his performance was not pretty standard a number of his answers were not complete sentences trailed off or did n't make sense grammatically but in terms of style vs substance we 've learned over time that the optics matter a lot the kennedy nixon debates are the best example but george hw bush checking his watch obama 's peeved reaction to romney in 2012 paul ryan gulping water in the vp debate those things leave an impression americans watch debates they do n't just listen to them
it was n't being old and quiet it was him not being able to maintain coherent thoughts getting millions billions and trillions mixed up beat medicaid rape from sisters when talking about abortion golf etc i 'm not freaking out i just want a chance at a better president than these two bad and god awful candidates there is no way in hell trump would ever step aside and biden has a real chance of losing
because image matters more than substance to a large block of voters sadly most people in here and commenting on them have already made up their minds it 's the ones who have n't we should be concerned about
not the wsj but it ’s because every election has always been a popularity contest very rarely if ever has the less charismatic candidate won and biden could n’t string together a sentence while trump was wrong but came off confident
the debates have been about style ever since the debates were first done seriously the first general election debate in 1960 between nixon and kennedy was a disaster for nixon because he did n't look good on tv even though he was a good debater that even the democratic party did n't does n't seem to understand this is mind blowing
because not everyone cares about actual substance some people just vote based on vibes in an already close race losing that crowd would be significant
millions of people did n't watch the debate and have been shown by the media that biden looked old and weak while neglecting to report trump ignoring the moderators not answering any questions americans wanted to know and making up lies and false information it is a failing of journalism a failing of the wsj and many others
as a democrat and someone who will vote for biden and really absolutely anyone over trump it is grounds for a freak out we all want trump to lose in november that is the most important thing by far for the country biden really really hurt himself last night with his performance and there ’s no sugar coating it the reason for that is it ’s pretty difficult to elect someone to arguably the most important and demanding job in the world in good conscience who looks like they are about to keel over and lose their train of thought multiple times mid sentence the only saving grace here if you can call it that is that the other candidate is a lying corrupt megalomaniac
no idea what debate you were watching
it would be an incredibly risky move yes and at least as of an hour or so ago biden and his team looked prepared to forge ahead and shake the debate off as a bad night
it 's certainly not likely but it 's possible who could replace him there 's a long list but there 's not an obvious choice
great questions we tackled some of them last night and we ’ll be answering more of them in the days to come
i can tell you per dnc current rule but keep in mind the dnc is a private corporation who can change or ignore their own rules at any given moment in time including writing a new rule to purge biden at will in a pre convention drop out the simplified explanation is the bound delegates 3 894 of 4 000 become unbound new candidates seek to gain a majority of delegates to cinch nomination a bit more detailed explanation if no candidate wins a majority in the first round then 740 “ superdelegates ” become eligible to vote to in selecting the nominee post convention harrison consults congressional leadership and the democratic governor 's association he then takes their guidance to the dnc where per the party 's call 438 dnc folks discuss and then seek a majority vote on who will be the new nominee
he is the president not the king congress has to write changes to laws like the tax code republicans have made it their priority to block whatever he advances if he is reelected and democrats pick up enough seats he will deliver
i did n't realize how every day would bring a new adventure each election has its own identity its own narrative its own twists its own plotlines its own soundtracks i was born in north carolina grew up in georgia and missouri seeing things from different vantage points and perspectives makes this job more fascinating every day there is never a dull moment that 's for sure
keep in mind the sentencing trump to prison is different from him actually going to prison it 's likely pending appeal given the number of ways that the verdict lacks prior precedent
interesting point about july the second week of july the us is hosting a nato summit in dc when biden will meet with a number of other world leaders that same week as you note trump is scheduled to be sentenced in ny over the stormy daniels case
there ’s been plenty of grumbling from anonymous staffers that biden was not up to the task check out
well it 's only a single data point but a text i sent my friend before the end of the debate yes it 's ugly perhaps this will spur him to step aside have a nice wild democratic convention it was n't just that his performance was bad but that it 's very apparently age related and it 's not going to get any better over the course of 4 years aging does n't happen in a linear way regardless my vote will go to the candidate with the best chance of beating trump
and there was not a single ' will trump step down ' article after becoming a convicted felon
it will almost certainly have to be his decision at the end of the day but biden does spend a lot of time consulting with longtime aides and family members he listens to what they say if certain people tell him certain things he could be convinced the question will be if democrats believe biden ’s poor debate performance could lead to a landslide blowout across the ticket wiping out democratic candidates for the senate house and governorships then it becomes a more existential problem for the party
he wo n't drop out most he might do is replace kamala with newsom
i disagree biden ’s performance during the state of the union was forceful energetic and defiant even republicans were taken aback by how well he performed there were several big differences between the two events both of which started at 9 pm the biggest difference biden had a teleprompter during the state of the union during the debate he did not
if things are off the record they are off the record our job is to get as much on the record for our readers as possible which is what we are busy doing as i type this
is trump given a pass on the mountain of lies and wins the debate even without answering almost any questions the public is interested in hearing or does the media not have a responsibility to the public to report actual truths
how how can a rapist a convicted criminal who stole secrets who subs for russia is a pathological liar and brags about stroke tests and has roe v wade wrapped around his throat be ahead one day i will wake up from this coma i know it
is the court finally going to rule on that
the democrats have terrible pr you have a guy trump who did very little to help the middle class as president he did nothing to make healthcare or drugs affordable he did nothing at the border before he could pass an order after covid hit he actually screwed this cohntry during covid by acting like it was nothing and killed over a million people he gave the wealthy a huve tax break while the middle class break is expiring he also aleinated our alies why are nt the democrats yelling this from the rooftops and i hear very little pr on bidens accompljshments
i just want to point out now that you are finishing up you have n't answered any questions from those of us who expressed concerns about the bias in your coverage and the lack of reporting on trump there are many concerns in this thread now would be a good time to acknowledge one or admit you are unfairly biased
thank you for that absolutely pointless “ well biden could win or trump could win ” analysis glad they pay you the big bucks
what about kamala harris taking over is that an option
i do n't get why people are surprised about the debate we 've seen biden this way for months now everyone was in denial calling the videos of him acting erratically cheap fakes is anyone actually surprised
the only people who are surprised are people who did n’t see through the media bullshit gaslighting you all tried to pull about biden ’s mental state this was an “ emperor has no clothes ” moment finally exposing both the white white house and the media for lying to us
buttigieg would have annihilated trump at the debate though he went unchallenged so many times last night
james k polk was nominated shortly before the election no not that something that happened 150 years is really a useful touchstone edit except that maybe he voluntarily chose to only do one term
newsom was at the debate for a reason he knows he ’s a perfect candidate for this
newsom is a bad pick just look at california ’s issues and anyone would agree the nation especially swing states do not look highly upon california it has the most revenue of any state government it has the highest cost of living it has the poorest outcomes for state run services newsom is a bad choice moreover he even stopped giving live state of the union addresses due to the negative perception within the state itself
i have a bit of a facisnation every election watching the 3rd parties and independents want to know why they do n't do well here is what we had in 2020 to pick from other then biden and trump howie hawkins green party founder who was once a promising opposition candidate who has become a bit of a crybaby with a its not fair campaign we had some nutcase libertarian who thought the answer to our problems was defund everything and leave everyone to fend for themselves with for profit pubilc services from there we had don blakenship with the constitution party thanks but no thanks and a handful of far left and far right nutcases with no qualifications i am a biden fan i will happily vote for him again if you want another option you have to get one of the minor parties to put together a platform and get on the ballot everywhere actual engage the voting public and above all that get someone who people could actually see as president and make sure its someone who can actually do the job
i think it is a shame that buttigieg is n't more popular guy knows multiple languages and seems like a good candidate for the job
speaking of ohio tim ryan would be my choice
any vote for biden would effectively be a vote for whoever would replace him the electors chosen for the electoral college would just vote for that person
i realize this will probably be rightly dismissed but there 's a golden once in a century opportunity here for a 3rd party to swoop in and seize the window of confusion and incompetence here if even with someone jumping from a major party i do n't know if anyone is in the position to identify and exploit the opportunity but it is there
bernie is well known and popular when they did polling hillary vs trump bernie vs trump back when hillary and bernie were facing off in the primaries 2016 i believe hillary was neck and neck with trump but bernie was slaughtering trump in head to head polls i do n't see why age itself should be an issue just the cognitive impairments that come with age bernie does n't seem to be even slightly cognitively impaired
serious question if ' rump wins ' 24 will there be a real ' 28 election
people forget kamala exists it 's not misogynoir though
in other countries presidential candidates are decided around 4 6 months prior to the election so it 's not that bad
goodness there were only 6 weeks from the announcement to the upcoming election on july 4th in the uk i really wish we did n't have these absurdly long elections
given that democracy is apparently at stake would someone like mitt romney unite enough voters across both aisles to win this election i know he ’s not a democrat but he ’s probably the most well respected centre ground candidate possible and desperate times call for desperate measures
the main argument coming from the most vocal backers of biden is anybody but trump i do n't know why people keep pushing this idea that it will be hard for the party to unify around somebody else polls last year showed over 60 % of democrats were united in the belief that the incumbent president of their own party should n't run again that is unprecedented
and who would it be it seems the reason this did n't get any serious consideration earlier in the game is that no one could come up with a viable replacement those many dems would prefer like newsom wo n't garner a single vote from the sane republicans and moderate to conservative independents who were crucial last round
was last night unlikely i do n’t know a single person in real life who was surprised by biden ’s performance mostly just sad that it was so bad why are media remembers who have more access to the president seemingly so shocked at last nights debate
i do n't love what happened last night but there 's a lot of time to get back on track and less than 24 hours after it happened it seems to not be his new norm
why was last night “ not likely ” it ’s been clear for months that biden has left the lights on after walking off the reservation the media have been lying to us saying that in private he ’s the best biden ever they ’ve been telling us our eyes are lying to us but if you just looked anyone could see that last night was inevitable not unlikely
i know you are not responding anymore but on the off chance you see this all year everyone in the country has been saying biden is too old when polled a huge percent of americans say they are concerned about his age prominent dems try to do damage control for him all the time and hold him to such a low standard yesterday his performance in the debate confirmed many peoples ' fears are legitimate also when polled many people say they wish they had different choices no one is happy with this match up and no one really felt like they had an alternative choice i 've heard some news sources blame the voters for only supporting biden but from my perspective as someone who is pretty politically involved in my region of the country there was no discussion of a different candidate running i had no say in that which was frustrating many people feel this way and wish they had someone else so with all that why do the dems not listen to what the voters really want and give them another choice run newsome or whitmer or whoever else it 's a risk but is it totally impossible that people might latch onto that because you 're actually doing something that so many people are asking more and responding to their concerns yeah the candidate might lose and that would suck but it 's also becoming increasingly likely that biden will not win so why not take the risk if you 're damned either way
i really think democrats are going to punt to 28 they wo n't pull biden because that will require so many questions why are you just now doing this you had to have seen this before who 's really been running the show i think it also makes them look bad in allowing him to run for a second term i think lastly nobody that would even have a shot would run all the candidates have their eyes on 28 pete gavin whitmer harris nobody that might possibly win will run
people voted for hillary clinton in the primary and it was a close general election
biden is the current president and is an old man it 's not the same situation as 2016
they 're nominating the same guy who beat trump because everyone voted for him in the primary actually
this is worse they lied and lied and lied about joe who can no longer speak reliably without a teleprompter they declined the super bowl interview to hide it they say he has lost a step lies he has a problem do we see 82 year old bernie gaping open mouthed not blinking and struggling for words no he gets on tv regularly without notes and hits his points pretty well
that did n’t fucking happen for the last goddamn time i wish bernie bros would let this nonsense die
no one is forcing biden on you except for biden
well well well why am i not surprised
i do n’t think he can become president while being the govenor of california i think he ’ll need time to shed the california costal elite label for swing voters
he 's been positioning himself for over a year moving right and courting national publicity because he saw this coming
newsom may have enough influence to make his case to biden in private rather than in public
bold to assume there 's going to be another election
i hope they do internal polling in important swing states of their top 10 most famous people in the party
gavin leaves a lot to be desired as governor and standard bearer prtizker in il has performed better and would be far more palatable for middle america coastal and beltway people need to process that asap
thanks for the response but what about the conversations democrats are having today in washington if any not the people like newsom and whitmer who have come out in support of biden and his performance are the dems in the house and senate having closed door meetings regarding the rest of this campaign and their re election campaigns going forward from last night
is it fair to say that the extreme optimism after the state of the union address and the extreme pessimism after the debate were both overreactions frankly i was n't terribly surprised by either performance it is n't surprising that he was able to hold it together for a well rehearsed speech but was n't able to hold it together for a fast paced back and forth affair
and 2 it ’s biden ’s job to challenge trump on the lies in real time cnn did a huge fact check after the debate but it was biden ’s job to call trump out honest question how do you do that when as a candidate you are supposed to give the other candidate uninterrupted time to speak is biden just supposed to use his entire allotted time debunking lie spewed by trump during his turn prior and never get to speak about his own policies as a result in my opinion when a debate format between two people includes rules dictating that they must let each other speak without interruption it 's the responsibility of a third party to do the fact checking and hold the two participants accountable is that not the entire purpose of having a moderator in the first place
cnn 's fact check on biden showed a long list of lies as well
is it not one of the rules that the candidates are supposed to answer the questions honest question how do you fact check your opponent when as a candidate you are supposed to give said opponent uninterrupted time to speak is biden just supposed to use his entire allotted time debunking lies spewed by trump during his turn prior and never get to speak about his own policies as a result in my opinion when a debate format between two people includes rules dictating that they must let each other speak without interruption it 's the responsibility of a third party to do the fact checking and hold the two participants accountable is that not the entire purpose of having a moderator in the first place are they really there just to ask questions a job that could be performed by having a simple list prepared
aides shielded him from scrutiny quite a lot biden has nt answered unscripted questions from media in atleast the last year every time they get done the preordained questions the hoard of aides come in and start screaming
can it be that he just gets too tired near the end of the day it seems like a big part of it fine if you 're in most positions even in the senate a bit scary for a president though
did n't they already agree to the second debate in september if the gop believes biden is weak they 'd want to repeat this performance again closer to their election no
i do n’t think that i agree with this logic they already agreed to a debate why would trump want to look weak by withdrawing after biden shot himself in the foot so badly last night much more likely he presses his advantage if he can and at a debate closer to the timing of the election this was a very early debate which could be the one and only saving grace for dems the best moments for trump were n’t even when he was talking it was when biden was and stumbling
please trump will want to debate biden anywhere and anyhow after that it ’s the most effective campaign weapon against biden give him enough rope to hang himself it ’s the biden camp that wo n’t want him anywhere near a debate stage staring open mouthed into the abyss
his idiot advisers sent him out there to do what he doesn't do best which is recite things he 's best when he 's talking off the cuff does n't help that he was sick
i heard people comment on there not being water present at the podiums and that he might have been dried out and stifling coughing all night i 'm not defending his performance but that would check out if 10 minutes later he was joe again
cold meds wore off maybe should have gotten him the og sudafed
i think biden was nervous he 'll recover later this year
keeping your answer in mind and taking it further i wonder if being more unscripted can prove to be a danger further to biden considering how he seemed during the debate while i personally prefer looking at the content of what ’s being said campaigning as a 80 year old is already difficult and strenuous the american public and even the media to a certain extent seem focused on general appearance manner and body language i worry if he ’s going to be willing to change course so dramatically lack of campaigning in particular swing states is what doomed hrc in 2016 according to many post mortems of that election
he needs to show americans that he is n't the same person that they saw during the debate and he might have to do it again and again the million dollar question in your opinion would he actually be able of such a feat we have been told again and again that biden is sharp behind closed doors what we collectively saw last night does n't follow was this just an off night or is this who he is at this point
christ it 's kinda insane that everything comes down to those 3 states
so we and democracy are fucked great
i agree that it should n't have come down to these 2 the fact is though that it is neither party is replacing their nominee so why are we pretending like there 's even a choice as to who the better candidate is for this country one oversaw an insurrection and promised to be a day 1 dictator the other stutters and is sometimes slow answering questions like in a normal civilized society there 's literally no choice as to who is better
and i 'll take that over an ill meaning wanna be dictator any day
i too like to pull made up percentages out of my ass
trump might say something that will sink his chances before november biden will be fine maybe there will even be another debate for the election
this is an absurd overreaction the debate was not good for biden but here and elsewhere in the thread you seem to be assuming that every single independent was glued to last night 's debate and instantly decided to vote for trump politics do n't work like that and we are still 5 months away from the election a lot can happen i 'm not saying just be positive but i am saying do n't overreact the people who are saying this is nothing to worry about are wrong but the people who think this one debate has changed the race into a landslide win for trump are wrong as well
the world is full of gaslighting denial about how bad he did they 've been doing it for years which is why people are so surprised now that they finally paid attention for 90 minutes
i 'd like this fact checked
cut the mic when not actively addressing the question asked the moderators literally told trump he could talk about whatever the fuck he wanted
they could have challenged him on obviously egregious lies like complaining about post birth abortions
fact checking in real time is unrealistic especially when you have someone who is as big of a liar as trump it just empowers him to flood the zone with bullshit realistically there should be some sort of way to hash out policy debates in writing it 's kind of absurd to expect people to speak accurately beyond their prepped talking points
in that case cnn should ’ve saved themselves the talent budget money printed out questions on a sheet and let the candidates shred it on stage
i agree except for the times that trump appealed to the moderators implying that ' you know its true that i did n't say that thing that i 'm on video saying ' and it would 've been more than appropriate for them to clarify our reporting the facts on that is x
iirc cnn said they were going to live fact check no
that article does n't seem credible to me it states very directly that almost all the people reporting signs of biden slipping are republicans and the specific reasoning they give is incredibly vague the few times the article describes actual events it 's mundane things like mixing up a name
follow up do you feel any vindication after the vitriol your paper received after that story
if the debate was ar noon and not 9 pm he may of had a shot
no question for you sorry just a follow up comment on that whoever decided to have the debate starting at 9 pm needs to get a stern talking to yeah you get most live views at that hour but internet exists nowadays good bits will be played ad infinitum for weeks anyway and considering how many geriatrics there is in politics the advisors should know well enough that 9 pm is right about bedtime not a public event schedule and if they wanted to get more younger people to watch and vote we do n't do tv anyway we stream from online at the time that suits us of course there 's trump who regularly tweets at 3 am because he does n't have neither a job nor a schedule like most people who have to earn their money
hilarious to see conservatives complain that biden did n’t push back trump ’s nonstop lies and that when he did he was n’t sticking to the questions asked
ty for the link but am a subscriber edit wow so it looks like an open convention would be a real poopshow like the dem convention in chicago in the 60s
sorry but i included the pre event talking heads segment hal sparks play by play i 've cued it to the spot where it happens
wtf is that mean lol nothing talking out of his ass this trump dude hahaha
i am a long time subscriber and know all this hence my question
about as direct an answer as any of trumps last night nice
holy shit this answer was so bad i might as well be watching trump talk about migrants as a response to a question on climate change maybe we could try again like last night mr wsj ill remind you that the question was not about previous articles you 've written or stormy daniels rather the question is why are you and the rest of the msm focused so heavily on biden 's lack of charisma instead of the firehose of lies and fascism perpetrated by donald trump last night
that 's not an answer why are y' all ignoring the insane amount of lies he spews that 's what you should be covering not an old man has a sore throat how about trump shrugging like a 4 year old when biden asked if he 'll leave nato or trumps comments on black jobs or the crazy lies about immigrants just walking around slaughtering everyone or just any sentence he managed to spew out since every single one was filled with lies
yes but do nt we already know he can pause and stutter this was n't about what if he needed to debate random candidates like is he going to need to debate someone other than trump at this point this was about him debating trump i get that we see that biden did nt perform in a way that would make him look good on a debate stage amongst many candidates but he still made his position clear and answered questions how did he do trump v biden biden stuttered trump lied biden got tripped up but trump literally did nt answer almost any questions this was an easy win with the clips if you focused on substance for sure there s multiple instances of the same question being up on screen and trump uses all his time to talk about something unrelated or the last question but no lets just focus on biden being slow cause he is the president it does nt matter what s at stake we all know the state of things is that mostly undecided independent voters may decide the election and how is this reaction supposed to help the news saying the democratic party is in turmoil by focusing on bidens age when he is still the only one out of the two to actually give answers and a plan instead of trump and his lies and dodging its just telling helping independents to vote for trump smart people on the fence could look past him being slow and see that trumps answers were fos but they wo nt even see that cause you guys are focusing on the president and doing trumps damage for him
pathetic non answer trump ’s mental acuity is just as poor if not worse than biden ’s yet you focus more on biden ’s gaffes than trump ’s so answer the question why do you give more leeway to trump when he ’s just as mentally compromised why do and the rest of the mainstream media refuse to call out his lies
do n't be so harsh on yourself as you pretty much nailed it
saw another comment somewhere else today that bill clinton once said americans prefer “ strong and wrong over weak and right ” and last night ’s debate was exactly that
this is not the 1st exposure to trump or biden we all know biden is old and trump is a liar no new ground was broken no one will care about this debate in 2 weeks and it will be business as usual again
i do n't understand how people can still say that was anything other than a complete disaster that should disqualify someone from driving a bus much less running a country
you 'd think that would be the case with trumps debates but it did n't have that outcome in 2016
how do you feel about the media latching onto a narrative of joe biden being underwhelming instead of pointing out the incredible amount of lies and misinformation being supplied by a candidate who has voiced an intent to be a dictator can the media be trusted to ever keep the truth accountable or are you just excited to elect a demagogue
let 's not forget what happened to howard dean oh when times were so much simpler
millions and billions seems unfair because it is more a slip of the tongue the other stuff was very different and the most painful was when trump called him out there s a difference between being garbled and stammering and nonsensical the moments when he appears to have lost track of what he was saying
trump also confozzles millions and billions it 's just not common for biden who is held to higher standard
which is a fundamental problem with the political system how many times have you heard ' he just does n't seem like someone you could have a beer with which is a bananas thing to say about anyone holding an office that important
what is the function of the vp if not to step in if potus can not carry out the duties of the office
i particularly like your question about replacement candidate x vs replacement candidate y since the primaries are effectively over it would be hard to deal with a contested choice between two people trying to replace biden on the ticket it could get quite messy especially when there are issues like israel and immigration dividing the party
i agree and i am sure the secret service has made it clear they rather have trump under some sort of house arrest for their convivence too
biden 's cognition ie early symptoms of age related decline has been a political topic since 2019 but the mainstream media largely covered for him and accepted ' wh ' clarifications over biden 's cognitive stumbles gaffes with little pushback over the fact that biden is potus and not some nebulous ' wh ' who can speak over biden i have nothing nice to say about donilon
my family watched it and my brothers absent any media impressions my wife said it was elder abuse at one point we both texted she was upstairs omg at the same time it was a fucking trainwreck and everyone could see that i ’m impressed the pundits on cnn afterward did n’t try to pretend it was n’t
you ’re really forcing the people on this subreddit to face reality that biden ’s cognitive state is questionable
i ’m sorry but i watched both and he stuttered and got things wrong just as much in sotu as the debate i do not understand what the big deal was either way i ’m voting for him because being a bit old is nowhere as bad as doing an insurrection
it 's never about the questions it 's not a test it 's whoever is more appealing on stage it 's theatre baby
everyone knows trump lies and lies about everything what trump did last night is not news to anyone what 's going to change if the media say trump lied
what about biden lying about being endorsed by border patrol union the fine people hoax no americans dying under his presidency abroad and inheriting 9 % inflation it was 2 %
because the news just wants to sell newspapers views whatever they will ignore a mountain of lies to focus on someone flubbing lines in a debate even if the intent behind those lines was perfectly clear
because we have a two party system and one of those parties is filled with uneducated gullible voters who have been lured into fervently supporting a manipulative narcissistic conman and the rest of the country is now forced to rationalize and legitimize his success because he 's now the leader of one of our two political parties
because a large part of the republican voter base actually hate america and freedom they ’ll burn the country to the ground to rebuild it in their image control religion hate
they are screaming from the rooftops unfortunately the wsj and many other publications do n't care to print the truth that you just stated they would rather keep us reading click bait about biden being old then remind us of who trump was
or admit you are unfairly biased he did that he clearly stated he works for the wsj
ask a stupid question get a stupid answer
i think you 're looking for a crystal ball what you 're doing is asking a human with no more available information than anyone else and yeah the race is tight the polls are within 1 %
clinton annihilated trump too and pete would have the same result
he 's not my favorite pick but he is eloquent
i do n't think america will vote for him and it 's not just because he 's gay everyone has to remember just how shallow things are when it comes to politics the sort of nerdy guy will usually lose even if the other guy is awful the dnc has really just been fucking themselves over for so long you should easily have at least 3 4 hot shot young people it 's a country with 330 million people
which is great but if pete got parachuted in there would n't be another debate to be had it would be him in total campaign mode and that did n't really go well last time
james polk was funny like that campaigned on annexing more land did that and then declined to run for reelection because he was like what do you mean reelection i 'm already finished
james k polk was nominated shortly before the election no but i 'm sure an election pre civil war a hell of a lot less states and lack of modern media looked a lot differently too this was a time when the only people who could vote were white guys so the demographics and number of people and groups you had to appeal to was n't nearly as complicated
that was before primaries where conventions determined the winner defying them now would n't look good
if 150 years is n't too old for abortion law then it 's not too old for election precedents
bigger problem is how to switch out kamala because no one likes her either she ’s potentially less liked than biden which is a feat
the only way a third party ever stands a chance is if we get ranked choice voting since we do n't have that the two parties have too much power in and over our system of government that no third party candidate has or will ever stand a chance without an alteration to the rules that allows for it our politics are ruled by a duopoly which is only slightly better than a monopoly which under democracy is almost effectively the same thing as a monarchy
perot could have won if he had n't dropped out and come back nader did n't want to win but wanted to change the system
i think it would be nearly impossible at this late hour said candidate would get no support from the two major parties and it 's extremely difficult to build a campaign completely from scratch in 4 months the only even slightly viable option would be a well known billionaire who does n't have to worry about fundraising and has immediate name recognition i 'm not sure there 's anyone out there who both wants it and is well liked enough though somebody like a bezos could theoretically pull it off
and no one in power wants this
bernie is even older than biden he 'll be 83 at the election and 87 after 4 years in office he may be more with it for now but the whole country just saw what 4 years did to biden bottom line is nobody over 80 has any business running a country health and mental cognition can just decline so suddenly by that age if you 're going to replace biden it really can not be for another person that old
trading in one old guy for another is just going to hurt the dems they need young blood that will made trump look like a felonious fossil
i do n't see why age itself should be an issue just the cognitive impairments that come with age bernie does n't seem to be even slightly cognitively impaired everyone who runs for president plans to stay the full four year term and electoral planning will consider how likely it is they 'll be viable for eight years considering the electoral advantage had by an incumbent the problem is n't where bernie is now the problem is predicting where he 'll be in 4 8 years if he was in his 40s or 50s then he 'll probably be fine that 's a lot less dependable for someone who 's 82
those many dems would prefer like newsom wo n't garner a single vote from the sane republicans and moderate to conservative independents who were crucial last round this he 's a slick politician and a good debater but many of his policies are just a non starter for too many people outside of extremely liberal places like ca and ny gavin might lose literally every swing state
this is why we need to have actual competitive primaries without the dnc conspiring with candidates they prefer
harris would be the only one able to in my opinion people keep saying newsome but he would a be denying a non white woman the potential spot that she would had gotten via succession b he ’s the govenor of california and seen as one of the elites also if it is n’t harris there would be complaints about not letting others to really get the opportunity to campaign since biden was the presummed nominee i can also see settling with the vp will quickly have any infighting potential solved because this would be succession
biden ’s analytics team is probably the best ever assembled biden had to win over independents last night the biden analytics teams said that trump tanked in their tracking when he trump made personal insults they ’d expected trump to be more disciplined and not repeat the manic performance of the first 2020 debate when trump got more aggressive they saw him alienating swing voters when the president responded on abortion and ukraine they saw him winning those rounds this is gon na be a close election even if biden steps away at this point i do n’t trust polls because it ’s incredibly difficult to do polling these days people have cell phones
i was surprised it was so bad when you look just a couple months back to the state of the union that was a totally different vigor
it was n’t just his voice or how he was speaking though he was fumbling the most simple talking points basically anyone else in the democratic party would have done a better job objectively removing his age and stuttering he did an incredible poor job and then came out and said he did an amazing job he ’s supposed to rise above trumps level of delusion not sink to match it
that does n’t matter the clips of him looking senile and confused are n’t going away and is it worth the risk of him performing like this at the next debate two months before the election there is n’t going to be a third debate and harris ca n’t carry biden and her own baggage
yeah he 's okay in the middle of the day reading a teleprompter that was never up for debate but that does not change what happened last night and what millions of people saw in front of their eyes he could have to take an important call at 3 am and he 's clearly not with it enough to handle that
yeah like wine i ’m sure he ’ll just continue to get better with age
where was this last night not an ounce of this vigor was there
you are graphing at straws and coping it is over for him
sundowning only happens at certain times
a close election that should have been a democratic landslide it would have been with a candidate that people did n't hate it 's not totally fair how clinton was portrayed but the gop spent years going after her reputation the lies worked and the dem party faithful pushed her to the nomination anyway
uh i think you are forgetting how heavily skewed the dnc was for hillary and against bernie they forced that shit down everyone 's throats to the maximum
it is the same the democrats want to force a specific person regardless of what the majority of their base wants it was rejected last time and will be this time
he is not the same person as 4 years ago definitely wo n't be the same person in 5 6 months from now
can we dispense with the ' he was picked in the primary ' argument he had the full weight of the dnc and democratic fundraising apparatus behind him unless for some reason his polls were sub 30 no one else other than the incumbent would have been elected in a million years
was n't much of a primary no one else really campaigned
they 're nominating the same guy who beat trump because everyone voted for him in the primary actually here is a dnc hack stating ' there will be no primary there will be no debate ' live on msnbc around a year ago when rfk jr marianne williamson and dean phillips were attempting to run for the democratic nomination
they did n't even have debates how can you think that was a real primary
trump more than anything lost the election it 's a different time and people do nt care about the same shit they did then trump is gon na win unless the dems run someone like kennedy
the thing that did n't happen is bernie bros just slandering that the clinton campaign tried with obama too it just did n't work that time because calling the supporting base for the first realistic black candidate obama boys was as tone deaf as you could expect from that out of touch candidate but if biden loses we 'll just get another four years of you lot sticking your head in the sand to avoid any reflection
i do n't get why people ca n't understand this liberal coastal elite politicians are perceived as pure cancer in most states including a large number of swing states in the middle of the country the last 2 dnc presidents prior to biden were from arkansas and illinois and the political climate has only shifted further since then
our idiot governor in florida just changed the law to allow himself to run for president back when he stood a chance
i do n't think he 'll ever be president but it could be entertaining to watch him try
i think it ’s his stuttering in part different scenarios trigger it differently for some people and i could imagine the specific tension in the debate as a scenario where he really has to work on it which in turn slows him down not an excuse but it speaks more to him as a candidate if that ’s the case it is a flaw that takes nothing from his ability to do his job but does some damage to his image as a candidate
it would stupid of them to do so because biden was so bad yesterday it 's unlikely he 'll be like that again it would be giving him an opportunity to redeem himself but i mean i hope they do you never know what trump might decide
ya they agreed but that does n't mean they have to if polling in september has trump up by 5 why would he debate he can take any sort of hit from not and still be up
i was looking forward to watching trump perform the two handed water bottle move again
surely he can ask for a water during commercial brakes though right
water would n't have helped him string together coherent sentences though it may have been easier for people to hear how incoherent they were
bro the fucking president of the united states ca nt put on his big boy pants and ask for some fucking water that s peak cope
should have been in a full mech suit
how could he have been nervous the guy has been doing this in washington for over 50 years this was n’t his first rodeo
honestly he seems to do better in unscripted settings or reading off a teleprompter in situations like last night where he has to memorize scripted answers that 's where he really struggles you see him interact with people normally and he seems sharper
obviously not wsj but imo the damage has been dealt we all saw it and we all know he 's old this might not be how he always is but that is how he was when the spotlight was on him people today pointing out his rally and how he 's so much better sorry but negotiations with world leaders happen off script and without a teleprompter
what evidence does anyone have that he 's sharp behind closed doors if he 's so sharp then do n't act like a senile old man for one day he 's shown us who he is time and time again
i am not saying you 're wrong but you are not going to turn apathetic voters around with the message sure we are n't listening to you but vote for us anyway because the other guy is worse this election will come down to margins and i sure wish it would be a blow out for anyone who runs against trump but people have to face that it 's not going to be polls are n't everything but they should n't be discarded and the polling is bad biden is not improving the situation with what happened last night
again from a simplistic perspective the question is who 's best fit for president for a period of 4 years both options again do nt really have a predictable outcome as to which will fair better for us our families our community our country and the world legitimate arguments could be made for each party which is why you see this being so polarizing
biden did n’t just stutter he literally mumbled and droned on about nothing sometimes he literally stopped talking because he could n’t remember what he was talking about he looked confused at times and other times like he was asleep at one point he said something about being raped by your sister ’ in the context of abortion rights in other points he literally could n’t even finish a sentence trump is deranged and a menace but putting biden up there was a terrible look for the democratic party and probably just sealed a victory for trump i voted biden hillary and obama both times blue up and down the line in every national and local election and was until last night 100 000 % voting biden this debate made me think if this is the best the democratic party can do for us that i should probably just sit at home on election night
why not just choose a different candidate any reason you have been and are continuing to push biden
as i wrote it ’s a “ guess ” that “ i ” have we are all just guessing here my guess is based on my own take looking at the results of focus groups and from the general reaction people in r politics are all falling back on “ i ’ll take competent old biden over the felon dictator ” yeah me too but there are too many people in the middle who do n’t see it that way unfortunately and biden did nothing to help himself with that group who will decide the election
trump has said things that would end the careers of anyone else dozens and dozens of times over there is nothing he could add that loses him anyone he has n't already lost which unfortunately leaves biden
what could he possibly say that would swing a lot of people he ’s said every vile thing under the sun without movement in the polls the problem is n’t trump there ’s a clear anti trump majority but many of them saw that disaster last night and are left with nowhere to go they were never going to vote for trump but now they wo n’t vote at all
trump might say something that will sink his chances before november trump is made out of teflon there 's never going to be something he himself does to ruin his chances if biden ca n't outshine him and he just showed that he fucking ca n't then he loses simple as that
the difference is that i do n't believe for a second that things are going to improve biden is getting older not younger and the dnc only ever doubles down even when that 's the worst possible position
problem is if they stop the gaslighting now it raises an awful lot of questions about how long this has been going on for and why nobody who knows better has spoken up about it either the guy we saw last night has been calling the shots or somebody else has without the public knowing
his unwillingness to answer was a clear enough message to me
the purpose of the debate is to let the candidates speak their mind and voters to make the decisiom for themselves it ’s untenable for the moderators to try and fact check in real time we ’d still be at the debate right now if that were the case
yeah call me when both sides are pissed for the moderator 's deciding what is true and false what is answering and not answering moderators ca n't be expected to play god
why stop at just the questions we should see which candidate can rip a phonebook in half
not in real time during the debate that is 100 % untenable
it 's wsj you did n't expect right spin
he wo n't express an opinion here
i too would like to hear your position on the pushback and if your paper has more responsibility to truth or profit
this exactly i have a feeling that biden goes to bed fairly early every night the brain gets conditioned to the repetition for the first 1 3 of the debate it seemed like his mind was truly tired being nervous caused the stutter and stammer to naturally happen more which was n’t a big deal but the slow thinking and confusion was a direct effect of it being late in the evening on the east coast he looked and sounded like a completely different person a couple of hours ago at his rally the late timing of a 9 00pm start directly had an effect on biden in my opinion that ’s not an excuse for what we saw but it could be the reason for such a massive change in temperament between last night and today
it ’s very obviously because that ’s what americans are talking about trump lying is n’t anything new we just witnessed biden completely fall apart mentally in possibly the only debate of this election in the most televised public appearance outside d c that ’s unique and huge it was the job of both candidates to call each other out for lying
in what universe was biden ’s issue a sore throat you ’re only lying to yourself the general population saw an old confused man who probably would n’t pass a cognitive test
at a certain point the delivery and appearance can be so shocking that it ’s silly to just engage with the substance if biden showed up in a black face having shaved his head and wearing a wife beater you would nt expect us to focus on the substance of the debate
he 's not wrong though trump is a piece of shit but he 's not the president biden is and he looked absolutely pathetic he fucking blew it the trump is worse rhetoric was a viable strategy four years ago but it is n't anymore after a performance like that
in 2 weeks trump might be in jail july 11th has n't happened yet
i disagree the long meandering and ultimately garbled response that ended with biden saying we killed medicare will be shown in ads for months it clearly shows that biden is too old he 's no longer capable of being president if trump wins because biden is his opponent it will be on the democratic leaders
he clearly rehearsed too much and did n't have the mental capacity to save his train of thought or sentences when he got off track it came off very poorly obviously if you distill what he was trying to say it becomes obvious he rehearsed and understood the question he just could n't effectively debate and came across weak he 's really lucky trump was n't meaner that would have probably benefitted biden
i agree and i am sure the secret service has made it clear they rather have trump under some sort of house arrest for their convivence too the secret service had to because jared and ivanka refused to let them use a restroom in their personal residence it 's clear that the secret service is willing and capable of doing their job in a way that 's far less convenient and more expensive than what they prefer if the right person tells them no
it was a fucking trainwreck and everyone could see that i ’m impressed the pundits on cnn afterward did n’t try to pretend it was n’t for me this was the biggest surprise of the night
he 's an old man of course his cognitive state is questionable but he 's miles better than the alternative unfortunately
its the energy and volume of his delivery he did n’t seem like an old man using every bit of energy to complete a sentence and that it was past his bedtime his voice was low and it was hard to hear at time optics are more important than facts unfortunately
like the kerry vs bush debates kerry proved absolute mastery over every single topic and bush proved his ignorance however kerry was accused of looking like a know it all people declared him the loser
theatre or are you just looking for the circus trump will give you a show so much fun look at that ooo so magical wow i never thought such a fat ass could walk the tight rope wow oh no he just killed his political opponent like he said he would ooo an elephant i have more faith in the average american to not be swayed by the optics of a debate but if the media tells you biden lost and all your friends say biden lost and everyone says he should be replaced it 's hard to argue with meanwhile trump was trump so everyone just lets him be deplorable not a single word about his lies it 's irresponsible and the wsj is a key perpetrator
everyone knows trump lies but there could have been stories about how putin evidently told him of his desire for ukraine or how trump refused to say he would concede or how he left the economy in tatters and it recovered after he left office that 's just 3 things off the top of my head the tip of the iceberg none of this has to be pro biden but the media or at least journalists have the duty to report these things just saying biden is old or trump is a liar is n't doing your job
this is the end result of how the gop has operated since the 90s they lied more and more and it just kept working and then along comes trump who lies about literally everything and it still works the gop has accepted that truth does n't matter now their voters are split between gullible true believers and people who are in on the scam but do n't care about truth because they want to remake america into a theocracy
it 's also because of the extremely anti democratic electoral college otherweise there would have been no gw bush no trump
one day washington elite will stop rolling their eyes when people complain about the two party system and that day very well could be soon
ca n’t disagree with that in any case the horserace worshipping political press needs to be told how terrible they are
in my defense they posed that question to start with but not in my defense i do n't know what else i expected them to say
perception seems to be what swings the public 's favor for the most important office in the country you and i both know that biden is many leagues above trump in ability and fitness for the presidency but it did n't look that way on stage that scares me
polk is lowkey the best president ever at completely fulfilling campaign promises and then fucking off i 'm not saying that what he accomplished was necessarily exemplary but he was n't a bullshitter and i respect that now we ca n't get politicians to go the fuck away after they 've half assed campaign promises and spent half their time in an elected office just trying to get re elected
in four short years he met his ev'ry goal he seized the whole southwest from mexico made sure the tariffs fell and made the english sell the oregon territory he built an independent treasury having done all this he sought no second term
nominating at the convention was standard at the time when garfield was nominated by the gop in 1880 he was at the convention to support john sherman but when no candidate could gain the majority someone suggested garfield and despite his protestations he secured the nomination
i do n't see it as much less complicated you can always split any group into a million subgroups
the kamala issue makes this thing that much more complicated she was a horrible choice for vp in 2020 and absolutely nobody likes her there 's a reason she dropped out of the race before the primaries even started in a normal scenario biden would resign and harris would be the nominee as the incumbent that 's clearly not an option so now if biden is replaced the dems are going to face questions as to why kamala was picked at all if she 's clearly not up to the job and that 's not even getting into how some people will react to the black woman vp being passed over for the job
not potentially even in ca they do n't like her honestly i 'm surprised he chose her to begin with back in 2020 would need to be newsom or someone else with similar name recognition i think he 's the only one who would have a chance this late in the game
the third parties need to more seriously start at the lower offices and build their way up the republican party was a third party once they did n’t just come out the gate with lincoln and win everything these other parties need to run for dog catcher and everything else rather than emerging every 4 years for the top spot and then basically quietly going away
getting on the ballot as a 3rd party is too difficult either the short time left rfk ca n’t do it in enough states
at least elon is n't eligible thank god
what we really need is not to have parties
everything you say makes sense but she wo n't win i think she 's less likely than biden to win
see i was pleasantly surprised by the sotu lol
biden had vigor but slurred at state of the union it is not normal we are just used to him doing it joe has mild parkinsonian symptoms like a stiff gait with limited arm swing open mouth expression breathy voice reflux problem low blink rate and falls mild parkinsons at a late age does n't always involve tremor sometimes just pill rolling or a twitch in a few fingers meds can eliminate the tremor entirely for a while the big problem for biden is that his speech requires extra compensatory processing due to his stutter always stopping to say look or in fact then regrouping so his ability to reliably speak without a teleprompter is going to be affected quite badly and will betray his cognitive acuity i do n't think his brain is actually garbled
yeah he should have brutalized trump it was a rare situation where trump was lured out of his safety bubble and actually would have to confront somebody anybody who was n't maga and the media would be obliged to cover it then biden dropped the ball bigly biden might have gotten away with being a little fragile if he landed more hits and did n't say stupid stuff about beating medicare and rambling on about golf not a good look biden 's inability to handle this easy set up seriously brings into question his ability to run the country and to deal with many of the serious foreign policy issues that are going on right now not to mention handling maga 's attempts to steal the next election which wo n't be that much of an issue if trump genuinely wins
there is a very frustrating amount of gaslighting coming out of the biden campaign the economy is super great the 60 % of you who are really struggling are just imagining things and need to look at these cooked statistics biden did great last night not sure what you were watching but he really hit trump hard with that alley cat line biden is totally spry and high energy in meetings even though his public appearances do n't show that at all if we just talk about how great our policies are people will love us and vote for us etc etc
he did admit today he does n't debate or speak as well as he used to honestly biden being honest about his current state might be the best thing he can do now beyond dropping out even i almost feel sorry for him despite how deeply disappointed i am with the democratic party for elevating him in 2020
he was n't great last night but that link above shows he 's bounced back seems like just an off night but very poorly timed
next debate there ca n’t be another debate his campaign is on drugs if they think he should do another one
ya it 's like arguing john elway could still be a starting qb because he threw a pass in the backyard
as long as the worlds issues happen before 2 pm then all good
people like to pretend that party primaries are these totally free and fair exercises that are immune to pressure and outside influence the dnc runs the democratic primaries they have enormous control over which candidates are seen and how popular they are allowed to be the grim cowardice of mumbling out oh well the voters chose hillary after everyone in the party structure did their level best to crush every other candidate is really just funny at this point and here we are doing it all over again
incumbents always have an easier time winning as long as they have n't been i dunno guilty of committing 34 felonies that 's like politics 101
it is entirely different biden is president comparing the steps needed to take him out of the running to them putting their thumb on the scales to get clinton and biden as nominees is apples and oranges
who does the majority of the dem base actually want though i feel like there 's really no superstar alternative democrats are vastly more ideologically diverse than republicans
the establishment democrats forced him to victory in the 2020 primaries with the extreme round up of endorsements all at once after biden started out losing primaries he placed 5th in iowa 5th democrats were more concerned about tipping the scales in favor of their establishment candidate than actually defeating trump
given his decay in four years i just reviewed a 2020 debate clip imagine how he ’d be at the end of his second term
so trump proved that you can be president do nothing but have your workers go out a do a lot of damage in trumps case biden could literally sleep 24 7 while the team he hires takes care of things you 're not just voting for a president you 're also voting for the people they 're going to hire
and like who was even trying to challenge him in any of the primaries anyway he was picked because it was a 1 man race not hard to lose those
and he totally did n’t have the dnc behind him because he was the vice president or anything
i know you ’re specifically talking about politicians here but as someone who was born and raised in a northeastern blue state and has spent most of her adult life in california it really bothers me that we are generally perceived as being somehow “ less american ” than people in other parts of the country
i do n’t think he can become president while being the govenor of california i think he ’ll need time to shed the california costal elite label for swing voters they did n't say that in a legal sense
i ’m pretty sure newsome can run for president based on california laws i ’m saying he would n’t win because he is the govenor of california he is currently the picture of costal elites for swing voters and conservatives he would need time after serving to shed that label
maybe but it also gives biden an easy way to claim trump is afraid to debate him and the debates are also a good way to catch the attention of the independent political mayflys who ignore politics for 47 months at a stretch which is what they 're really after
that seems like giving too much faith to polling for a candidate that won the 2016 election in defiance of many polls
you would sure think so
again from a simplistic perspective the question is who 's best fit for president for a period of 4 years the guy not trying to sell us out both options again do nt really have a predictable outcome as to which will fair better for us our families our community our country and the world legitimate arguments could be made for each party which is why you see this being so polarizing literally no argument can be made for trump not in good faith name one good argument that can be applied to a trump presidency given everything he 's openly said he wants to do there is a very predictable outcome as to what 's better for our country and people and it is n't to elect trump
so your solution to the issue is to help trump get elected and consequently likely doom future generations once he appoints more sc justices that 'll spit all over the constitution for the next generation or 2 elect someone who openly expressed admiration for dictators someone who incited an insurrection make no mistake sitting it out as a democratic voter is the same as voting for trump
i assume you think they should replace biden but that 's not as easy as people are making it out to be replace him with who it 's hard for me to believe that having a messy fractured fight over the party candidate would be a good thing
yeah but you 're probably not someone he cares aboutb unless you were on the fence
i admittedly do n't really read wsj i guess now i 'm reminded of why
i get it but you d think with democracy on the line and a team of highly tuned political animals around him someone would have thought of that
biden tripped up a few answers overall his responses were far more coherent than trumps which were mostly completely delusional fantasy trumps body language and voice were better than bidens but the substance of what he was saying did nt measure up to biden 's at all
he 'd pass a cognitive test just fine just like trump passed his dementia test although not in the way he thinks biden sounded awful not sure at any point he looked literally confused dumbfounded by the nonsense he was hearing yeah sure but not confused and yeah he 's old so he looks old they both do they 're both very old and should n't be running
my point is more from a perspective of legitimizing trump as a candidate he should have been eviscerated every hour of every day since jan 6th 2021 but the media let him get away with one of the most disgraceful acts in our nation ’s history by painting him as a serious candidate for the last 4 years and we are all about to pay the price for it
you go on believing that a man that shits himself and surrounds himself with self assured con men with no experience is in any world close to the other old guy that surrounds himself with people that did n't get their degrees at liberty university
from the chatter i have seen on this sub trump is perfectly able to continue running for president and even win the presidency while inside a prison cell
trump will not be in jail i 'm not even one of the many people expecting him to get special treatment i think a jail sentence is on the table but i suspect if he gets a jail sentence 1 he will have his sentence delayed until appeals which i do n't think is that rare for low level felonies 2 the supreme court will rule that the president is immune to state prosecutions during their term which will align with their arguments on why trump could still run which are their concerns about one state preventing the choice of the nation
damn and to think hundreds of thousands if not millions of middle eastern folks could still be alive today if kerry did n't come off as such a know it all god damn we 're so stupid
remember when the tea party was a fringe movement not the entire republican party
definitely gave me some anxiety and thoughts of trying again to move to canada he just did n't seem long for this world honestly i do n't know what biden his advisors and the dnc were thinking the reason this election is close is because it 's biden his age and complicity in israel are major baggage
why fulfil campaign promises when you can keep the job indefinitely by saying we 'll get it done this time for sure every election right
that 's wild to just be fucking around at some convention and then get peer pressured into becoming the president lol
she ’d have to fail upward in some way or be bought off if people just came together and gave her a giant book deal or some kind of committee position that did nothing but made millions a year i think she ’d probably just take it if that was the price i ca n’t see her stepping down of her own accord if it was n’t being bought off to do that it all is a glaring example of how the system is rigged though nobody wants biden or kamala to run and nobody really did they were just forced on people nobody really likes any of the candidates trump does have some authentic support but even with him it ’s more that people do n’t like the alternatives
newsome has effectively zero name recognition with regular folk if someone like bernie is a 10 in recognition newsome is a 1
i 'm surprised he chose her to begin with back in 2020 she met all of his criteria for being the ideal candidate 1 black 2 woman it was just pandering to the far left who think those are important qualifications in a leader it did n't actually matter if she was a competent black woman she was just well known already so they ran with it biden harris was a horrible ticket even in 2020 but people were so tired of trump it did n't matter now they 've been trump free for almost 4 years and the economy inflation is really bad wars have been breaking out it 's enough for some people to say hmm was trump really that bad add a dash of cognitive decline give 'em a zombie like senile debate performance and now you 've got a real problem
yea actually i 'm going with that too lol
yeah let ’s just be the only body politic in world history to not have political factions genius idea why did n’t we think of that before
part of the problem with harris is nobody really follows her she is just there for admin stuff and only gets articles when she fucks up saying something i think if she gets media training and the spotlight she can get enough swing voters and people who do n’t want someone who looks old and senile to win especially off of a charasmatic vice president i think harris could become likeable enough to win she does n’t have close to hillary ’s baggage
seriously the bickering about golf was infuriating all he had to say was i 'm the president of the united states i do n't have time to play golf you absolute felon
this is exactly the point i 've been trying to make to people we knew he was old and has a stutter that 's not news to anyone the most alarming part of last night was how poorly he did tactically he simply can not react quickly or think on his feet at all anymore he opened himself up for easy dunks countless times and showed zero ability to steer the conversation to his administration 's strengths sure trump was n't answering the questions but strategy wise that was a smart plan in this debate format whether we like it or not steer the conversation to your talking points and avoid your weaknesses for any fence sitters who somehow do n't believe trump is a threat to democracy last night they saw one man who lied a lot but spoke to his strengths with conviction vs a man who looked wholly unable to handle the most difficult job in the world right now let alone for the next 4 years
bro i know i know a bunch of it is russian indian bots but like 2016 there 's a bunch of legit frustration about the dems absolute ineptitude and pretending things are hunky dory when they just obviously are n't is having the opposite effect they are hoping because dem voters are ever so slightly smarter than the right for the right you can piss on there face and tell them it 's raining for the dems the voters are just a little too educated for that you at least need the courtesy to give them an umbrella before you piss on them
he was great in 2020 and is a great one term president he should take the win and bow out that was the obvious choice that people were expecting i hardly think people were expecting to see a 86 year old president as biden will be at the end of his term
it had already been agreed upon and scheduled before the first debate happened sept 10th for biden to still do it is likely suicide for biden to renege on doing it is absolutely suicide
democrats would rally behind anyone they put up there most of us here did n’t have biden as our first pick in 2020 and yet here we are defending him and hoping he wins over trump
that is why they should have actually used the fucking primaries instead of just costing along because hey at least biden is n't trump they have had 3 5 years to prepare for this to act like it was a surprise when age was one of the biggest talking points before he was elected is gaslighting of the highest degree
the majority of the dem base obviously wants the candidate op wants duh s
newsom stewart i would vote for paris hilton even given her recent speech on child abuse
these types of comments are always crazy to me biden won against trump in 2020 so your logic is the dnc did n't care about winning even though they won and forced a candidate to win which they did n't try to do what
if trumps non stop golfing proved anything it 's that the team hired by the president can get a lot done let joe sleep while his team does the work i do n't care rather have professional experts in the white house vs the absolute brain drain and sycophants we got with trump
yep probably worse than regan in his second term falling asleep in cabinet meetings and increasingly incoherent
also bidens people are currently doing their job very competently i d like for that to continue
i agree but the previous poster made it seem like there was a possibility of anyone else there was n't
for trump to win he only needs to retain his base and have low turnout overall he 's been leading polls for months and the electoral map favors him his campaign is n't hinging much on undecideds who are mostly likely to just stay home in a situation like this all else equal trump coasts to a win from here so he has no incentive to risk another debate biden could call him out but it wo n't stick like the clips from last night people remember what they see hillary did the same thing in 2016 when she bailed on the final primary debate against bernie at the last minute she had a narrow lead on him in the upcoming california primary so why risk a shake up it 's not exactly sporting but it 's effective
lol after this there 's no way biden could claim that trump is the one afraid to debate
i do n't think it 's easy but things looked a hell of a lot more promising in 2015 than today it was going to be close but things are now absolutely rock bottom dire for reasons that ultimately fall on biden
i agree that is why i said “ that ’s not an excuse for what we saw ” i ’m just trying to do brain gymnastics on why especially for the first 30 minutes or so he was so incoherent we ca n’t have a president that has a bedtime of 9 00pm
i do n't believe that at all a lump of coal would be a better candidate than donald trump my point is that ignoring biden 's faults as a candidate by insisting that trump is worse is n't a viable strategy anymore despite the fact that it 's true i follow a lot of people on social media who are fairly left leaning and pretty much all of them hate biden or at the very least think he 's a joke no one wants him to be president but they 're stuck with him because the alternative is a literal nazi back in 2020 this was doable but his performance at the debate completely tanked any confidence left in him combine that with him bumbling the gaza crisis and the number of potential voters are dropping like flies hell i 've been willing to let a lot of his failings slide for the greater good despite being pretty left leaning myself and even i do n't know if i have the confidence to vote for him anymore i still will if it comes down to it because like i said he 's ultimately better than the alternative but the fact that i 'm even considering not voting if he 's the nominee shows how bad things have gotten with him he fucking sucks and if democrats want to actually put in an effort to save our democracy they need to drop him and get someone younger
yes we know that great look
and then get murdered less than a year into your term
i do n't think the problem there lies with her she does a lot more than gets reported and i saw her press secretary long ago being interviewed and saying that they sent out her appearances to the press daily and they just never got any kind of response i think her biggest problem as a candidate is falling into this middle zone that no one can get excited about progressives do n't like that she was a prosecutor and think she 's too middle of the road but the old moderates who like that she 's more middle of the road are less likely to support a woman or a minority or either she 's clearly competent but no one anywhere on the spectrum loves her she lacks biden 's one huge selling point from 2020 which was being a known quantity to having existing relationships with the many countries we needed to rebuild relationships with i would just anticipate a very very flaccid response
yeah that was incredible trump voluntarily highlighted something that everyone hates about his presidency the massive amount of time he spent playing golf instead of working and instead of pouncing on that like any rational person would do biden decided to go with i play golf too and i 'm better than you at it what the actual fuck man
or i do n't want to play golf on ivana 's grave
he was not a great candidate in 2020 he has been a good president
i hear you on paris hilton she is 100 % an underrated badass
retaining his base is n't enough overall he needs to win back the states that biden flipped between 2016 and 2020
if trump refuses to keep their already scheduled debate than its obvious
he also was n't a great debater in 2020 the dude has suffered from a stutter his entire life a good man a good politician and a good president yes a good public speaker no never
watch his debates in 2008 and 2012 like a completely different person
oh for sure but still not a great public speaker i ’m not saying last night was business as usual it was not good but he ’s never been a great orator makes me long for obama again honestly say what you will about his policies he ’s an amazing public speaker
we are witnessing our democracy being dismantled piece by piece
prosecutors must show that a defendant impaired the availability or integrity of documents or other records related to an official proceeding or attempted to do so ah they were n’t even after our precious documents no harm no foul kids
the bar was raised specifically for crimes committed by one indicted felon named trump
of all the dc circuit only one judge a trump judge ruled this way the supremes just blessed carl nichols ' bullshit
just in time for the next election this so called court says it 's okay to storm the capitol next time
this is insane because the obstruction charge was stronger than the vast vast vast amount of previous obstruction charges i have ever seen in the news
okay so if we do it we ’re in the clear too alright folks roll on up and get your buckets of feces ready to smear on the walls of the capitol building feel free to piss wherever you want so long as you do n’t harm any official documents
he ’s giving a speech right now and his energy is a night and day difference i wish this joe had been the one to show up at the debate
every time he talked about policy decisions they were good presentation was horrible
wow you know it was bad when the new republic is talking about alternatives
it actually does n't matter if he can do it or not someone failing to do the job is better than an actual dictator who openly wants to destroy the united states the only thing that should ever be talked about in this election is how one side is openly saying we are here to end democracy they said that into a microphone on stage for the whole world to see and hear they will destroy this country if we do n't start actually stopping them
just do what trump does call it fake news and move on
just going off the headline this is a fair statement i ’m a big supporter of biden his falter did n’t effect that but it is completely responsible to expect his campaign to address the issue
he has proved he can do the job of president for the last four years we are n't electing him to debate
fine sort of but are we really going to give donald trump a pass he spent the entire debate rambling and literally making things up i do n’t think this can be stressed enough he spent the entire debate completely fabricating his record and biden ’s using wild and insane hyperbole and lies meanwhile we know biden can be lucid and articulate well relatively speaking he has a stutter he can slur his words he obviously had a cold he did not look or sound well but now we ’re going to just jump to the conclusion that he ’s suffering from cognitive decline ’ that ’s how low the bar is for trump wow
nonsense our system can handle a president who becomes unit to serve in the unlikely event that happens with biden through the 25th amendment and other processes what trump 's four years demonstrated was that we are unprepared for a president who intends to use the levers of power to end our democratic republic and turn the country into his own putin style oligarchy wake the fuck up americs
right let ’s not hold the convicted felon rapist sucker loser dictator in waiting accountable per usual i suppose
when ’s trump and melania going to give the country an honest conversation about whether trump can stop committing felonies
the truth is that the democrats need someone to make the case to the american people about the dangers of a trump second term and to refute trump 's lies i do n't think president biden can do this his voice is literally weakening he ca n't campaign for weeks on end
the question is whether or not he 'll still support policies that democratic voters support it does n't matter whether it 's biden harris newsom or any other democratic candidate do they support what the voters want or at the very least more than trump will and for biden regardless of his current condition that answer is yes
i wish the billy madison moderator was there last night and could have used this line multiple times “ at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul ”
i ’ll vote for whoever is against trump this time but it does seem like this would be an opportunity bow out and graciously pass the torch to a strong younger candidate he could campaign for them bring all of his supporters to them and make a clear statement that the country comes first over pride and ego it would also totally disrupt the entire republican campaign strategy which has been almost purely based on attacking biden as a person rather than any policy
bullshit headline does not even address his stutter last night did not look great to be sure but by my estimation he would forget a point he was about to make try and recall it on the fly and stutter his way through his time some fading memory but the lion 's share of his issues were his stutter in my opinion
wow the click bait is fierce today
what ’s embarrassing is people think trump won the debate by simply being able to talk even though everything he said was bullshit america is fucking wild right now
yall turned on biden quicker than you decided trump bad in 2015 curious to see how you treat your next target shoulda included elon in this math
we got the worst joe biden we ’ve ever seen in the most important moment possible what other vital moments is he going to look like that we do n’t know it ’s clearly time to step down
there needs to be an honest conversation about his medical condition i know and have known plenty of people in there late 70 's early 80 's that are mentally 20 years younger than biden if anyone has experience this with a loved one it is plain as day what is happening
the debate was disaster i think i 'll vote for the guy that gave a rousing inspiring speech right after biden
anyone wondering should watch his raleigh appearance today
for all those undecided people in the middle this debate should make them run from biden obama just made a statement backing biden i wish he just would n't have said anything joe biden should not be the candidate we ca n't risk losing more supreme court seats and putting a rabid dictator in office the dems have to put someone else up
fuck south caolina bernie should 've been president
no they do n't own the country anything of the sort notice how the same people saying this rubbish never hold the gop to the same standard trump is a 34 times convicted felon a liar and a rapist but nobody says he ought to drop out of the race but biden must drop out cos he 's old as fuck well guess what biden did n't grow 81 years in one night he 's old he stammers but he 's been an effective president and he 's not a liar a rapist or a felon he does n't fuck porn stars when his wife is pregnant or when she 's not pregnant and people do n't like to talk about this biden is n't an incestuous leech like trump who has openly sexualized his own daughter ivanka
not really it 's fine to just not have trump as long as biden is able to get across the finish line
given that a potato would be better than the other guy i think we can live with joe
he ’s so weak that the worst candidate in american history is beating him the arrogance is appalling
hubris plain and simple put away your pride and do what ’s right for the county step aside
it is disingenuous to spin this as something biden can overcome if he does n't make any other mistakes putting aside the reality that he has always been gaffe prone this was n't merely a bad performance it was catastrophic no one could watch what happened last night and still believe biden is capable of being president we are n't electing his handlers to be the decision maker in chief we are electing the candidate on the ballot we all need to be vocal that biden has to step aside right now for the good of the country if he is on the ballot we are handing trump the presidency and that can not happen let 's stop spinning this having biden 's back right now is being brutally honest with him that he is not capable of winning the presidency no matter how little he will be involved in executing the duties of the office he needs to refuse the nomination immediately and throw his weight behind a specific candidate not named kamala
we had elections he won you do n't get to now change that and select for us
anyone remember aesop 's fable of the tortoise biden vs the hare trump i will stick with slow and steady
there was a big drop from the state of the union to last night what will the drop be from today to 4 years from today that 's the question
he ’s obviously not capable of having any conversation
it would n't surprise me if rbg runs for the democrats in the next presidential election always looking for the worst choice all this shit is just sad
his state of the union speech a few months ago was great the best of his career maybe i 'm not changing my vote i despise trump but i can absolutely understand how this will hurt his chances with the undecided and those who may or may not vote
i wish the format had allowed trump to be a lot more of himself as well anyway i 'll be voting for biden as soon as my ballot arrives in the mail
scripted speech vs debate where you 're not allowed to bring in notes not a shocker that he 's outperforming the debate right now and it does little to alleviate my concerns if ever there was a time to show the world how sharp he is despite his age it was last night and he failed
he 's on the teleprompter he 's not thinking on his feet
maybe he could n’t take his nap before the debate since he ’s the prez had to block off that time for the debate so he crammed some work in instead of taking a nap someone said it somewhere here but the choice is evil grandpa the one that slaps you or box your ears cuz that ’s how he was raised or normal grandpa takes you to get ice cream cuz your parents say no sugar it ’s really not that hard of a choice
because trump is a succubus who sucks the breath out of any one with a shred of dignity
he 's capable of reading pre crafted words loudly that does n't mean shit
kinda does n’t matter though if he can only be relied on to act like a competent adult who can finish sentences like 60 % of the time i ’m not saying he ’s worthless or anything but like maybe he should n’t be the literal president
it ’s called sundowning elderly people get tired and more confused as the evening progresses this is n’t who i want in the white house
yeah the thing where he ca n’t function at night is called sundowning
because reading a prewritten speech barely requires any cognitive abilities
teleprompter speeches tell us nothing every time biden has spoken off the teleprompter over the last year has been a disaster he is clearly mentally diminished and having a hard time maintaining any train of thought let 's stop making excuses and demand a viable candidate before it is too late we are handing trump the white house and it will be a well deserved slaughter
he could be sundowning in the evening he does n't think straight of course i 'll still vote for him at least he 's not the devil
irrelevant in the grand scheme of things can voters depend on him to be coherent tomorrow or more importantly at age 86
he 's also reading off a fcking teleprompter and it does n't matter because the damage is already done and this is going to be his norm soon if it 's not already
people with dementia often have good days still they are n’t fit to lead a nation
the problem is that the portion of the voters who will decide the election only care about the presentation and do n’t understand or care about the nuances of policy and the only idea those voters came away from that debate with is that biden is too old to do it
agreed a kind but confused old man is better than a hateful narcissistic unintelligent wannabe dictator old man also why is n't there more discussion about who these two will be appointing and surrounding themselves with the president is the single figurehead but it takes a huge team of people to actually run things i have a lot of confidence in biden 's choices trump 's past and potential choices absolutely terrify me
it actually does n't matter if he can do it or not someone failing to do the job is better than an actual dictator who openly wants to destroy the united states yeah and while biden might be slowing down i trust his cabinet and advisors significantly more than i would trump 's
why should we believe the democrats are capable of “ saving democracy ” or even want to when they insist on running a candidate with historically low approval abysmal polling and just humiliated himself in a debate
someone failing to do the job is going to lose the election and then we get a dictator so yeah it matters a lot
it matters to swing voters he needs to step aside
well stopping him requires a candidate that can win that is n't more of the same gerontocracy i 've had teens in my gov't class that could have wiped the floor with trump last night time to take biden 's car keys away and let someone else drive and truth be told the republicans should do the same it 's ridiculous
vote for this person because the other person is worse is such a disservice to the democratic process and the dnc should be ashamed that this is their only move i will not vote for the felon but i also wo n’t vote for a person who is incoherent when he has to use his brain the chips will fall where they may and the dnc is totally to blame i was totally down to hold my nose and vote biden until last night he needs to step down down vote me if you must but i am certain that many other independents and moderates feel the same way i do the independents are going to be the group that decides and if we all vote not trump or biden it ’s likely trump will win
this is pure cope yes you ’re not wrong but biden simply is n’t going to overcome this narrative
reactionary how would a man who ’s openly mocked by top military brass be able to install himself as a dictator there ’s no power backing his authority to even do such a thing
the headlines should be trump must step down i 'm voting for a biden administration that will continue his policies i 'll vote for biden in a coma before voting for trump
it is a huge opportunity that some are obviously trying to grasp i 'm not sure it can be done it would take the entire party rallying behind a new candidate before the convention and before he steps aside there are probably a dozen different candidates battling behind the scenes right now for it to be them if he resigned then harris would be the default candidate this might be the only way without creating a huge mess there is nt time to pick a candidate in a democratic fashion picking a candidate at the convention would be insane
completely agree it is very sad everyone should listen to the debates in 2012 2008 2004 2000 1996 1992 1988 1984 does n't matter who you were for then what we have now is an unbelievable disaster
i ’m sure all the millions and millions of people who tuned in last night for a nationally televised event also watched the nc speech in the middle of a work day disaster averted
when he 's reading off a teleprompter i would hope he would n't fuck that up what 's more rare is to see him make sustained off the cuff remarks we saw what that looks like last night and it was a complete fucking disaster
just wait until the dnc hubris fucks us all over and then it will be months of them blaming “ the left ” and “ the youth ” for their absolutely predictable and avoidable failure
i do n't think there is such a thing as undecided
that ’s certainly true i watched the rally and he went off the cuff a few times i guess we will see if he can turn the optics around that definitely will not be easy
and now what you gon na vote for trump for rfk jr and his worm infested brain biden tanked one debate other presidents have rebounded from similar failures the facts of the election have n't changed trump is still a liar a rapist and a felon and he 's almost as old as biden
dude has been doing pretty well so far in policy or did a one night stumble change your mind for dictatorship
i am legitimately concerned about his ability to act effectively as president for another four years dems are absolutely refusing to say it because the other choice is trump
it sucks that it ’s illegal for the president to have notes when doing his job and that his job mirrors the debate exactly obviously the debate is the best representation of his performance while president
only normal grandpa is forcing us to make that choice biden could step aside and give the country a better choice if he does n't and trump wins biden 's entire political legacy will be forever tarnished and he will go down in history as the direct cause of this it is his choice
he should n't be but trump ca n't be trump will devastate education the courts our allies the environment the economy and everything he touches biden will surround himself with competent people who will also pick competent people
yeah but the other option would be a disaster so there really is no other choice
he gave a speech right after the debate where he was full of energy
you can come up with a reason someone should n't be in the white house for anyone who tries to get the job the important bit is to make your reasons real actual dangers not something that can be easily alleviated for example sundowning is a real problem and probably biden is suffering from it but he also surrounds himself with experts and professionals and would be open to someone telling him to wait until tomorrow to make this or that decision as we know trump does none of those things and that is the real reason we ca n't have trump in the white house and while biden is not ideal he has known good qualities and his deficiencies are easily alleviated
that ’s not a fact that ’s just your opinion you ’re not a doctor
you 're getting downvoted but you 're absolutely right biden was forced to think on his feet in the debate and absolutely terrifyingly failed to do so the people saying him being propped up on a stage and loudly reading words is reassuring are delusional
that ’s what i thought but sundowning usually occurs in dementia or alzheimers patients which is concerning
yeah you 're voting for way more than just the president do people enjoy the 6 3 split on the supreme court right now are people looking for it to stay that way forever if trump gets in the billionaires are definitely going to tell thomas and alito to hang it up so they can install a pair of 40 year olds roberts might opt to retire under a republican as well we could have a 6 3 for way past the rest of my natural life
yeah there 's a moment in history here that the democrats are straight up not able to meet right now that was unacceptable
dnc has its blame but you ’re not exempt either voting is a civic responsibility notice i ’m not saying duty here you do n’t have to do it sure it ’s your legal right not to but the outcome of your choice not to vote is just as much your responsibility as the outcome of if you did it ’s why we ’re in this mess in the first place
honestly if he had done that over a year ago harris would be positioned to wipe the floor with trump as she ’d have had time to establish her voice agency and maybe even buy some good will with the public while not being on the campaign trail the time for that passed a long time ago she ’s never been terribly popular and she ’s basically been a non entity for 4 years so she ’s not set up well to succeed here the dnc is enabling this nonsense and it ’s a shame to watch because we knew 4 years ago this would be the lineup and the risks with it if we did nothing and we did nothing
just like republicans ended democracy last time they were in power they tried to on january 6th
how would he even pull it off he has no in roads with the military to even force it to happen
by installing new top military brass who do n't mock him the president nominates generals admirals and the senate approves them it is n't far fetched to assume that if trump wins the election that the senate will be republican held as well
how would a man who ’s openly mocked by top military brass be able to install himself as a dictator there ’s no power backing his authority to even do such a thing i 'm sure there 's a chapter in project 2025 titled getting rid of war wokies or something along those lines
he wo n't its a common talking point by the far left that makes independent voters scoff at the absurdity the only people who actually think like this are gon na vote blue no matter what so its a moot point
slow and steady and highly effective even with this gop biden has passed a ton of bipartisan legislation and the us economy has defied all predictions of doom and gloom to be the current envy of the world
yeah he stuttered and mixed up his words and he had a weak raspy voice if you listen and watch him today he looks and sounds better after a night 's sleep optically it was a disaster but i had no problem with the overall substance of what he said yesterday
this right here i 'm in alabama so i 'm very invested in keeping dems in control of the fed gov because i can only imagine how much worse my life can will get under 4 yrs of trump screw joe biden 's ego and the dnc 's incompetence and apathy towards voters
i think we 'd be surprised depressed how many people pay no attention none my republican brother dismissed me last fall when i told him trump would be the republican nominee he laughed at me
do you not understand the conversation we 're having at r politics nobody 's voting for trump everyone 's voting for biden but the issue is that biden is n't good enough to win re election we need a replacement to reliably beat trump
and if it happens i expect the dems in the cabinet and kamala and even jill to do the right thing and have him step down
it 's kinda like the bar exam it 's idiotic meanwhile trump does n't need notes because he just babbles the same lies he 's screamed for a decade and the other person has to try and refute the gish gallop like you got ta constantly change gears and waste your time refuting how we had h2o under me and the most beautiful water when trump repealed a ton of clean water regulation and bragged about it
evil grandpa could step aside and allow a good person run instead why is biden the only one with agency
you changed the subject biden can not be trusted to be the president anymore and the convention has not yet happened
no it ’s not a binary choice the other option is joe biden bows out gracefully and a new dem candidate is installed before the convention there is still a lot of time many countries do n’t have these years long campaigns some just run for a month or two before their general election
every account saying this is a few months old with low karma these guys are all over reddit it ’s very hard to discern actual opinion from people who may not even be in the states i ’m not in the states just watching and concerned for democracy in general
stop huffing copium every sane person can see he is suffering from it being in denial is gon na hand trump the presidency
that ’s true i ’m not a doctor neither are like 99 % of people but most of them think he ’s got holes in his brain and a lot of them wo n’t vote for him because of it so what ’s your point
he could easily have a touch of dementia i also ca n't imagine the stress he 's under my dad gets worse when he 's stressed i 'll still take him over trump tho i 'd vote for my cat over trump at least there would be better people in the cabinet
if this is the most important election in american history and this is how they ’re choosing to run it
i ’ll definitely vote but it wo n’t be for either of the two major candidates at this point i ’m just hoping for some positive change in congress and senate
please explain how the protesters could have ended democracy even if they burned the building down this is such a meme and it makes the left look bad
he can only install with the overseeing of the secretary of the branch he ’s nominating for whom all hate him
link that evidence for me please
it does n’t matter what someone on r politics like you or i think about the substance of the speech of course i still want biden to win but is he going to be able to things are looking grim and the dems need to take a serious look at their options if democracy is on line
he had a week of prep and rest leading into the debate and looked like an old lost person in walmart he sounds better because he 's reading off a page vs forming his own thoughts on the spot look i 'm voting against trump no matter what but pretending last night was anything but a disaster is insulting and transparent
i do find it hilarious that this sub is called r politics
agree 100 % we 're so far down the rabbit hole as a country that no one is calling for the convicted felon known rapist and career criminal conman to step aside after he spewed vile anti american bullshit for 90 minutes
all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing biden is the good man trump is the evil but doing good requires you to do what is right
they changed the subject from someone ’s opinion of who ’s unfit to be president to someone ’s opinion of who ’s unfit to be president the difference will come down to the people each candidate will surround themselves with will it be another musical chairs of descending competence for trump or will they be more organized and accomplish many more of their goals their platform already has its sights set on marriage protections public education environmental protections what texts you ’re allowed to read the mere existence of libraries and social events social security child labor laws child marriage laws bodily autonomy and voting rights if trump is elected again it wo n’t be the same farce they will be prepared and hit the ground running “ you wo n’t be a dictator will you ” “ only on day one ”
but if it is november and he 's still the nominee it is a binary choice and the answer is still biden
unless and until biden makes that choice it 's not an option and you 're back to a binary choice trump or biden trump comes with the crew of project 2025 and biden comes with the crew that 's accomplished a lot in 4 years and actually know what they 're doing also biden has a vp if you 're thinking biden will die in office why do you not rank kamala harris as able to do the job she 's the vp after all you say joe biden bows out gracefully and a new dem candidate is installed why did n't you say and kamala steps into the role as vp she 's next in line but you skipped past her for some reason hmm
so you do n’t even live in this country and you ’re suggesting i ’m what a foreign plant because i said the struggling old man looked like a struggling old man
i ’m a doctor a neurologist i diagnose neurologic disorders including dementia on a daily basis he does not have holes in his brains he does n’t not have dementia and he ’s not sundowning
but most of them think he ’s got holes in his brain this is a completely rational and salient point to make not at all said by a person with any type of preformed judgement a weather vane for civility one might say s
dude there was an entire plan with an alternate slate of electors and a plot to have pence refuse to certify the votes in order to subvert the true electors e g end democracy the riot was just an excuse to halt the certification not a military coup
they ’d all just get arrested like they did it ’s a good meme tho these people do n’t know what an actual coup looks like
100 % this we do n’t want to replace him for our own sakes we ’ll vote for the dem ticket period we get the bigger picture we need him replaced for the independents and other voters required to win the election this is defcon 1 and anyone not seriously considering replacing biden is deluding themselves
it used to be relatively more relatively i said balanced until the right wing became fully insane and toxic and constantly would get banned so they fucked off to their safe space echo chamber it 's hilarious that they call this sub an echo chamber when they were the ones who expatriated to their r the donald and flaired user only subs they caused this sub to be an echo chamber by leaving especially cause they stopped talking politics and just started preaching revenge and hate as a platform
the rs did n’t even put forth a platform in 2020 we have one political party and one fascist death cult so yeah r politics is in favor of the guys doing politics and not trying to figure out what sequence of minorities have to be sacrificed to turn the orange calf into white jesus
i ’d say what ’s far down the rabbit hole is holding our leader to no standards as long as whatever he does does n’t make him as big of a piece of shit as donald trump which is a bar he could never really cross
so no response to biden being obviously not ok to be president anymore he ’s not even officially the nominee yet let ’s do everybody a favor and get him to step down so we can run someone that will beat trump
if that ends up being the case then i genuinely think we ’re cooked
it is n't binary because not voting at all is also a choice as is voting for a 3rd party candidate pretending that there are only 2 choices is exactly what will get trump elected the only chance we have is for biden to bow out now because there is zero chance biden can come back from this and we should n't convince ourselves to pretend otherwise
kamala ranks even lower than biden for voter approval sure she could do the job but she ’s not as electable if trump gets back in office it ’s a fact that he will do irreparable harm to our democracy project 2025 lays out the blueprint joe biden ’s hubris could very likely lead to the downfall of our country as we know it
you ’re able to diagnose public figures without ever speaking to them
so his brain is fine he just says stuff like “ we finally beat medicare ” because he means it is that supposed to be better “ we ’ll be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do child care elder care making sure that we continue to strengthen our health care system making sure that we ’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what i ’ve been able to do with the with the covid excuse me dealing with everything we have to do with ” biden said before freezing for several seconds ” we finally beat medicare ” he continued
he does not have holes in his brain unless you have access to ct or mris and are breaking hipaa you do n't know this and yes am physician too
how would you describe the public ’s opinion of his mental fitness feel free to substitute whatever description for “ too old ” that you ’d like
you mean the nothing burger that actually strengthened our democracy by clarifying the vice presidents role and brought criminal charges to most of the people involved our constitution is not so weak that a couple of republicans throwing a tantrum over losing almost cost us our democracy
where ’s the evidence to support that claim
ty time for a counter coup
they left because the would just get downvoted and banned anytime they dared question democrats
if it ’s your opinion that biden is unfit to serve due to his mental state then based on the crimes similar verbal mental lapses lies and sheer bullying for the last eight years from trump you must concede that he is also unfit mentally and morally therefore “ the difference will come down to ” see rest of above comment
are you sounds like you ’re trying to claim he has a diagnosis of dementia based on what exam
do you think he meant the prescription caps i did n't watch the debate because i 'm certainly in the nothing could change my mind on this group
what biden is n't his patient he made a comment on a reddit thread essentially stating that he has n't observed signs that could indicate a dementia diagnosis no one violated any oath here my guy
localize a hole in his brain in any location to a neurologic deficit he displays
so your argument is that the coup failed so it does n't count it was still the intent to overthrow a legitimate electoral result whether it worked or not is irrelevant to the fact that trump should n't be anywhere near a seat of power again
i doubt you 're acting in good faith but how 's reuters as an independent text according%20to%20the%20congressional%20committee%20that%20investigated%20the had%20won%20the%20popular%20vote%20in%20those%20places
downvoted yeah but banned lol there are maga mods for this sub they got banned because they 'd say bannable awful uncivilized shit they 're the reason we have that big rule bot for every post remember how the donald sub was so heinous and violent that reddit literally banned it yeah
of course i think that about trump but i do n’t see any possibility where he wo n’t be the nominee there is a possibility for biden to not be the nominee and going that way could save all of us the nyt opinion board and i actually agree on something for once biden needs to step down if we ’re going to defeat trump
no i never said that i ’m just wondering if it ’s normal for doctors to diagnose public figures based on tv broadcasts
here ’s the video if you wanna watch it
he might have meant all sorts of things he definitely did n’t mention that most of what he said was impossible to follow like he got teed up with an abortion question and immediately started talking about that girl who was killed by an illegal immigrant for absolutely no reason all of it was just extremely confused and disconnected
ic with the stiff gait in his left leg small vessel disease multi infarct hydrocephalus all wag since neither of us has examined him have neurocognitive testing detailed history labs or imaging to work with
thanks got some new insight that i did n’t know about coverage was mostly on the rioters so i did n’t know he formed his own legislative junta to force install appreciate you actually backing your stuff most ppl do n’t do that here
i get that but i think you may just be more optimistic than me i think it ’s probably still gon na be trump biden
happens all the time ask ronnie jackson
yeah it 's not good biden stumbles with words and then trump speaks clearly but just spouts utter nonsense
yeah you ’re skipping to the end and making that argument that ’s not the point i ’m making you ’re arguing against the wrong thing
biden was trying to address like 5 lies at the same time and it seems like it just scrambled his brain
restore equitable taxation the billionaire class is getting a free ride
time for america to eat its financial vegetables
imf often says something like this to many nations but not many nations follow their orders
if we raise the marginal tax rate for top earners and close some of the loopholes like the billionaire borrowing loophole and the corporate offshoring loophole it will fix the debt in a handful of years it is the addiction that the right has to giving out tax breaks based on debunked trickle down economics and the laffer curve that have put us into this situation
it 's foia friday here 's the latest from bloomberg news reporter and foia expert jason leopold in april 2023 russian state television aired video clips of a conversation between powell and the pranksters who go by the nicknames vovan and lexus the duo is known for pulling stunts designed to humiliate western leaders in this case they tricked powell into a virtual meeting during which they discussed inflation and rate hikes in a statement at the time a federal reserve board spokesperson said the discussion actually occurred in january and characterized it as a “ friendly conversation ” that “ took place in a context of our standing in support of the ukrainian people in this challenging time no sensitive or confidential information was discussed ” the fed spokesperson would n’t say anything else about the matter so say it with me i filed a foia request i wanted to know how the normally hypervigilant fed fell for such a prank whether any officials vetted the impersonators and the extent of any operational security failures i requested emails text messages and investigative reports related to the video chat so i waited until i got a nod from sources that the investigation was over and then in february i filed a new request for the same documents i ’d requested a year earlier this time i hit pay dirt not only did the foia office send me but i also got the fed ’s together they give a pretty thorough look at how the prank unfolded and what transpired after fed officials realized they ’d been hoodwinked
powell told the impersonator “ we 'll look around after we make those two and we 'll say should we do any more and then the question will be how long do we keep rates at this level and i think we 'll keep them there for quite some time interesting
do n’t care still voting for biden and if he gets replaced i ’ll vote for whoever replaces him
well trump ’s conduct when he debated hillary was borderline criminal so guess they forgot about that
if your response to this is “ who cares i ’m still voting biden to save democracy ” you need to realize that ’s the exact reason he needs to be replaced most committed dems are already voting against trump the presidency has always been a popularity contest and last night america saw their choices were a senile incoherent old man or an angry lying but coherent old man biden was already behind in the polls he has the lowest approval rating of any president at this point in their term and nate silver had given trump a 60 % chance of winning the election that was all before the debate we have nothing to lose by replacing him
mike pence and a fly has entered the chat
cnn was terrible trump was awful somehow biden was worse america has a lot of work to do
donald trump was a disciplined focused debater no he was n't he just behaved less badly than at previous debates this is like giving him ice cream for not pissing himself and falling out of the boat
you ’re right biden should have ignored every question and shouted an unending monologue about how bad trump is and how awful his record is
it is genuinely shocking that people did n’t expect what they saw from biden has anyone been paying attention to the president of the united states the past 2 years
governor whitmer should replace biden he will not win the swing states and this election is too important biden is too old period
“ but you have heard of it ” captain jack biden
even so it still comes down to voting for a mad man felon or an old man we are unfortunately in a situation unless it changes where the choice is one or the other even with last nights performance being like watching a child running amok in a store screaming nonsense and knocking things over as he throws shit around while at the same time watching the mother stand there and just saying in an almost inaudible voice now now you need to stop
there was a person who was sharp as a sack of wet mice at one podium and another with the reflexes of a bag of gravy at the other what a time to be alive
is this a trump quote because the hyperbole is real and no one really knows how debates went before the radio era but the trump trolls are out in force nice to see ya
biden has been on an obvious cognitive decline since he was sworn in and the media has completely played defense for him and some have even lavished him with hyperbolic praise like “ he ’s as sharp as ever ” then last night a lot of those same people who blatantly lied about his decline puzzlingly had a shocked pikachu face when he performed the way he did the polls have consistently shown that voters had serious concerns about his age and those concerns were ignored or excused away
i ’ll vote for a corpse over trump
we can only judge debate ' performance ' since such things were televised and the ' performance ' was a factor
when you rant and complain not provide a platform no proof or data to support your argument it is not a debate but a game show cnn do better
none of these media dopes have a problem with trump 's firehose of lies though clickbaiting assholes
it 's incredible that one guy who is demonstrably unfit can lie the entire time and refuse to answer questions and the other can have an extremely lackluster performance but the internet declares the liar the winner
wild that this gets more negative press than funding an ongoing genocide
you either die a hero or live long enough to
maybe all the media should shut the f up with their opinions or we will end up with trump due to the influence on the undecided maybe that s what they want
no i 'm sorry trump 's 2020 debate performance was worse
left wing media in full on meltdown mode it 's fascinating been telling us for months that every gaffe every missed step every wrong turn off the stage all of that was just a figment of our imagination he 's sharp behind closed doors the man who never holds press conferences finally was dragged out front and center for the world to see and the left wing media acts like their shocked at how he looked how he sounded and the lack of ability to literally talk
so what biden had a bad debate that 's all any concern of bidens ability to govern can be reassured that if it ever comes to it that biden becomes unfit to govern rest assured that he will step down gracefully can anyone say the same about trump let 's say trump beats biden and wins a 2nd term are you 100 % sure he will vacate the office after 4 years the fact that 's questionable or doubtful is all the convincing i need to decide who to vote for
i mean what 'd you expect i 'm voting for the turd sandwich
wow actually impressed this post is nt pro demoncrap but i guess the proof is in the pudding u just ca nt save it i guess they can still say bidens not trump wah wah
that 's where i am there is nothing that would get me to vote for trump nothing i 'll vote for whoever is running against him
still voting for biden and if he gets replaced i ’ll vote for whoever replaces him this right is why i do n't understand why he does n't drop out is there anybody right now that 's going i really love biden and if he drops out i 'm not voting voting for convicted felon donald trump who exactly are we losing if he drops out
this is such a bad take yes you were going to vote dnc no matter what but you do n't decide elections real independents in purple states not conservatives who claim the label decide the elections and real independents are not going to vote for whatever that was that we saw last night they might not vote for trump but they are not going to vote dnc either they will stay home or go third party either of those choices will give trump the election
i ’m tired of dems putting forth weak candidates that deliver trump hillary and biden yea i ’ll vote for a shit sandwich before i vote for trump but biden is being selfish he said he would only do one turn
joe 's got ta go no question about it dems have no chance if he does n't step aside
this is exactly why he needs to be replaced we will vote for him or whoever is on the democratic ticket because we see the bigger picture unfortunately the “ independents ” and “ moderates ” biden needs to actually win will definitely not vote for the biden we saw last night but they might vote for someone with a similar message who is younger and a better messenger
if you say you wo n't vote for biden it 's more likely he 'll get replaced with someone who more people would vote for
if anybody ever wondered why jonestown happened well pay attention to dems in the last 24hrs and you ’ll see how it happened
honestly i will protest vote if they continue with biden i do n't want trump to win and i wo n't vote for him but he absolutely will if they continue with a man who has warm soup for brains
the debate was never for you or for trump supporters it 's for all the people in the middle and that 's a disaster
that ’s the liberal way blue no matter their iq
but that was a display of fake strength americans wo n’t vote for someone this feeble he looked like dog shit to the degree that there ’s no coming back from that the denial needs to end quickly because he ’s not winning
pretty sure 538 had the general at 51 49 before the debate it 's currently 52 48 for biden i agree with your overall point just wanted to point out the polling model since i check up on it daily
finally some rationality on here after that biden is going to lose period he ’s not going to lose because people who would vote for his corpse to stop trump thought his debate performance was bad he ’s going to lose because the swing voters and moderates that will decide the election despite that they hardly pay attention to any other part of the campaign process just saw him perform like he belongs in hospice and that ’s the only impression of him they ’re going to take with themselves into the voting booth
it does n't matter that 's how the general public is going to view it when biden was literally on the other side of the stage actively shitting his pants
unironically would have been better i mean if he could demonstrate that he has the physical capacity to shout it would be better
trump ’s obnoxious but he at least seemed alert and mostly coherent a horrifically low bar to reach but there you go
honestly the times he looked the best were when he went on the offensive
biden could n't effectively string two sentences together
he gave a legitimately good state of the union speech that ’s where the cocaine accusations started coming from and after that i really thought the concerns were overstated and that he would be fine once the election started gearing up i was definitely wrong about that
yea they just thought that if they silenced everyone who talked about it and pretended that it was n’t happening that it would n’t matter now that ’s backfired
people have been believing the shameless lies that he ’s actually fine
has anyone been paying attention to the president of the united states the past 2 years yes which is why the narratives about how old and terrible biden is got smacked down he had one middling debate performance last night and every salty anti biden progressive on this subreddit forgot every interview and press conference and speech he 's given he 's had far more good moments than bad ones and the fact that so many liars on reddit are taking some stupid victory lap here is a sign of how gullible and easily misled many people on this site are
no those people were to busy saying those videos are all doctored all each and everyone it ’s crazy that people are so quick to jump and say they are when the guy is 81 years old even with the best medical team on the planet an 81 year old is still an 81 year old
it 's hard to post something like have you seen biden speak publicly in the past 2 years or so here when it just results in being downvoted because people do n't want to hear it
they ’ve been living in their echo chambers where they have been repeatedly lied to by the white house and the media his wife jill is a monster for letting him run again
most democrats on here default to lying about things you all knew he was in that condition you just prefer to lie because you all know that if you can keep up the lie and never acknowledge the truth lie then if proven wrong change subject the mainstream media will echo it you all just lie as a default and it is a concerted effort to lie the proof is in comment suppression and signal boosting while suppressing comments last night 's thread was mostly conservative or people being like wtf is wrong with biden we 're screwed etc comments turned off a new thread is open and it 's all pro biden stuff
oh but we should vote for him because trump i 'm so sick of hearing that lame excuse for a platform
sure all the republicans or center right independents that voted for biden in 2020 and will vote for him again will have no problem voting for a women
hmm well i guess i 'll vote for the geriatric that does n't want put me in a concentration camp what 's the point of pushing candidates at this point it 's either the party of everything gets worse or the party of nothing gets better fantastic
bro they were talking about replacing him on msnbc and cnn right after that performance he could not finish a thought and squandered almost every chance he had to make an argument for his re election it should have never been allowed to get to this point but he is not going to win the election like that
dude the author is jeff greenfield one of the most respected political analysts out there if anything he leans slightly dem was on the original rfk 's staff
the article explicitly mentions modern american history great job reading past the title lmao
even if you only read a text transcript of the debate you 'd see that biden ate shit half the transcript would be ellipsis and unintelligible which was n't even the worst part how he looked moved and spoke he seems like he 's 100 years old
or today 's supreme court decisions
and yet trump lost to him in 2020 when he was just as “ senile ” and democrats were “ hiding ” him short memory i guess i ’m digging the confidence among republicans
because it have been brigaded from all over
bro he should step down gracefully right now and is refusing your theory has already gone to shit
i ’m voting for the douchebag
unless you are completely brain dead you would know that people who will not vote for trump have been debating whether or not biden should be the candidate for years now
i 'd vote for a turd in a dixie cup over trump
what makes you think you are only allowed to vote for a democratic or republican
yeah this exactly as far as i can tell you have a bunch of people dead set on voting for trump voting against trump and then a set of people who are n't sure biden is doing nothing to convince the people who are n't sure so if you keep biden you 're basically hoping that trump says or does something worse than usual if you bring in an actual candidate that can articulate complex ideas and thoughts then you can start winning people over who are n't only voting against trump
if he drops out there is virtually no chance of trump losing will harris replace him that 's likely going to lead to a weaker showing than biden someone else who has the national recognition and appeal to run in his place with four months to gain recognition and to articulate a coherent policy platform the republicans and their news outlets will never stop crowing about how they were right and biden was unfit so the democrats are forced to pick and unknown at the last minute a relative unknown with no mandate from the primaries and could democrats unite behind a single replacement before the convention a closely contested convention would hurt their public perception even further i was completely in support of biden not running for a second term but that ship realistically sailed before the first primary was held and would be political suicide at this point
the great defenders of democracy lets have our duly elected senile candidate drop out so the dnc can appoint an unelected bureaucrat and push him into the white house we have to save democracy maybe they should cancel the elections like in ukraine and ban any public dissent and throw anyone who says biden is old in jail like zelensky does he knows how to defend democracy send him another trillion
disagree there ’s absolutely no such thing as an “ independent ” in this election no sane person is taking a step back and thinking to themselves “ you know i ’m just not sure at this point ” the two battleground groups are trying to get women who voted r last election to switch sides and trying to get young people to the polls last night biden lost ground on both counts
ehh i was at a ball game in another rural county in mi last night before the debates people started talking about the debates near me so i listened they were wondering if trump was going to say something awful about any group of people and the women were talking about abortion as in they were for the right to abortion those women piped right up about abortion it 's going to be like the midterms where abortion and not being ruled by fascists are the main points eta word
the answer is it 's people like you bidens handlers and dems know there 's millions of plebs who 'll vote democrat no matter what literally no matter what lol
he 's not going to be replaced though he won the primary the only way he gets replaced is if he voluntarily withdraws from the race and i do n't think he 'll do that the dnc replacing him would be a giant middle finger to the millions of americans that voted for him if the powers that be were serious about backing a new candidate they should have approached joe about declaring himself a one term president two years ago
someone who more people would vote for and who exactly would that be
nobody is claiming biden had an impressive performance on the other hand trump goes on nonsensical tirades about electric sharks and hannibal lecter and his batshit supporters cheer on his lunacy and claim he was sent by god now that is a cult
i would think it would be because of the lying piece of shit that a quarter of the population idolizes you know the rapist felon twice impeached piece of shit
if you protest vote then you want trump to win because a protest vote is helping trump win just be honest with yourself
and he definitely will with people choosing to protest vote do people seriously not remember 2016
it ’s gon na be hilarious when the fascism you willingly vote for comes for you too
only on r politics do these wwe fantasies have any legitimacy the univision focus group showed voters preferring biden more than trump after this debate
nate silver no longer works for 538 it was on still is n’t good news for biden though
polls lag by a week or so wait a week or two before the effects of the debate show right now biden ’s poll boost is still coming from trump ’s conviction
yes presidents should obviously be decided on how loud they shout and how well they can imitate a wwe wrestler portraying a fictional character
no he did n’t he claimed on live television that democrats support killing babies after they ’re born and said with a straight face that he did n’t pay to fuck a pornstar
what he responded to every question with endless and completely off topic bullshit sure biden was n't great but trump was actually deranged
you were n't wrong he has one off debate performance due to being under the weather and everyone on this subreddit forgets every single interview and press conference and speech he 's given the past 4 years it 's absurd
people have been gaslit look at the posts on reddit just hours before the debate people were posting memes fan fiction about how much biden would school trump reality is bidens best selling point for the average american is that he is not trump and that gets stale after 4 years no matter how much people want to comment i 'm still voting for biden despite etc etc in r politics
i 've watched his state of union speeches and many of his other speeches what am i pretending is n't happening when he does a good job and is n't a bumbling old fool unable to talk like fox news makes him out to be what am i pretending is n't happening when i saw him make plenty of good points throughout the debate last night while you pretend he was drooling all over himself speaking in tongues what 's going to backfire like it always does is underestimating biden and then saying he is using performance enhancing drugs or whatever mumbo jumbo the right comes up with when he speaks like he did at the state of the union and then trying to gaslight people into believing he 's a mute dementia patient when he has one middling performance
you mean the trump supporters on everything trump has ever said or bidens health because personally i 'm better off with biden 's health than trump any day and twice on sunday
saying biden had one middling debate performance is like saying the titanic had one middling cross atlantic voyage
no its not because i have like for instance the recent state of the union that sounded great are you going to gaslight and pretend he did n't
it took that long for the dictatorial candidate to finally triumph over the anybody but trump candidate but the good news for the dnc many in america 's strongest voting bloc would do anything to relive the last 4 years of reagan
gavin newsom has entered the chat
they clutch their pearls on msnbc so fast overy everything since 2016 they 've been in shell shock over that election since it happened i like msnbc and was disappointed in everyone but lawrence o'donnell last night
i sure did n’t fail to understand him and see he could form coherent thoughts what exactly did trump say that will sway any opinions
i will take that bet if you listened to biden he had good points
seems covid and the mail and votes had something to do with it but by that logic biden the great savior is going to get beat by a convicted felon
so many new names all repeating the exact same things and responding to other new names
contemplating on what to do ai nt going to get it done sure there are better candidates than biden for dems but that ai nt it chief as long as it ai nt trump so unless ur completely braindead u would know biden is ur only candidate
i 'd vote for elephant shit over trump
because voting third party in our current system amounts to not voting
voting 3rd party is a vote for trump in some states and that ca n't happen
when did he say that
i seen on univision last night a hispanic say joe speaks slow he has policies trump is just saying the same thing as last time
at what point did you get the impression that undecided voters are interested in hearing complex ideas and thoughts hillary clinton had the most in depth breakdown of her policy platform of any presidential candidate on her website and people still complained that she never talked about policy because they could n't be bothered to read any of that and they got bored and tuned out whenever she started to talk about details in her campaign speeches 2016 was about politician vs stupid wacky racist reality tv caricature 2020 was about stupid wacky racist reality tv caricature vs not stupid wacky racist reality tv caricature and 2024 is shaping up to be old guy vs wacky racist reality tv caricature
i did n’t vote in 2016 because i did n’t like trump or hillary i voted libertarian in 2020 because i did n’t like trump or biden this year i ’d rather vote trump over biden if neither party can present a competent candidate i ’ve suffered so much financially under biden and i ’ve watched my city and local culture absolutely demolished by undocumented immigrants biden clearly ca n’t take care of the economy the border and has no voice on the global stage i do n’t want to know what another 4 years of biden looks like
newsom whitmer harris we have three choices
oh come on it 's not like there was a free and open democratic primary he was not seriously contested
you are living in a left wing bubble if you truly believe that and besides voter apathy is a real thing the purple voter may hate trump but they will just stay home if they feel like both options are bad
you think trump gained hahaha
i live in a swing state and just talked to 2 coworkers that wo n’t vote for biden or trump replace biden and they might vote for them
there are millions of people who are undecided just because you are n't aware of them does n't make them non existent or insane as you implied
abortion is on the ballot this election many women who do n't follow politics did not know that in 2020 the right to abortion is a big deal to most women do n't factor that out
you can gas light yourself however you want into believing whatever makes you feel better biden has less potential voters today than he did yesterday that is an axiomatic truth and your refusal to face it is what put the country in this position to begin with
get out of your bubble dude some of us actually do n't have a horse in the race do n't generally care about politics and just saw the debate thinking wtf was that gave me zero insensitive to vote or even care about the next debate i and my coworkers sure did
vote for kennedy i know the pushback on that 1 he can win obviously both parties have been shit sandwiches for at least 8 years only way he ca n't is if we believe he ca n't 2 he is n't against vaccines him and all his kids are vaccinated he 's against lack of accountability or to sum it up he 's against bad vaccines would n't you rather have good vaccines than bad vaccines so would bobby but right now we 're not even allowed to evaluate good or bad vaccines this last point is n't a response i anticipate but i 'll just say he 's the only one with a positive vision for america more than 4 years from now economic power strong middle class use modern tools like blockchain to make federal money accountable and eliminate corruption he knows the real cause of problems he 's not just playing political football
and there are people who will always vote for trump what ’s your point get mad because a stranger refuses to vote for a criminal and dictator wannabe but hates her choice i have absolutely nothing to do with candidate selection i was given one dude in the primary biden
i mean his handlers are doing one hell of a job right why not vote for that cabinet jobs breaking records inflation is being worked on technology deals that do n't involve china cut costs to life saving medicine rescheduled marijuana etc biden 's handlers are doing great why would i vote for trump and his ghoolies all trump spoke about last night was about how he 's a victim and how he wants revenge never offered anything for the american people stop being reactionary
you mean to say it is n't more likely that he 'll be replaced if people voice their dissatisfaction i wo n't say you 're wrong but it paints a very ugly picture for democracy
vote happened but you can still speak make it clear that this guy is clearly not healthy enough to run it 'll make convincing him to step down easier
anybody who can articulate a thought and would run the same liberal program biden is nominally in charge of
i 'm sorry but biden is going to lose anyway especially in my state i do n't want either of these candidates and i want my will to be made known you can throw your vote away on biden if you like just like i 'm choosing to protest vote if they put him on the ballot i will still vote blue for the other candidates on there
this election is of extreme importance and biden can not win if he runs then we 're going to lose regardless of my one vote you realize what 's at stake here so why are you complacent i 'm expressing that he 's a bad candidate i ca n't vote for and your reaction is to attack the voter instead of holding the people accountable for this disaster of a candidate focus your energy on those that have caused this issue
because that ’s what people are talking about talk about fantasies over here
i see did n't know he left
i understand we 're not discussing the debate 's impact on polls just where they were prior to the debate
that is how it works unfortunately confidence is more important than substance
and then nobody pushed back on those things
yeah and to undecided voters that makes sense
which nobody caught because biden had one foot in the grave in the other camera
the difference is in the sotu address he was reading a prepared speech in the debate he is trying to go off memory which he showed he is n’t capable of doing
these excuses are n’t going to win an election it was n’t a cold and it was n’t a stutter it was someone who ca n’t communicate his thoughts and can not make an effective case outside of not being trump
he has given the fewest press conferences of any president in living memory precisely for this reason let ’s not pretend this debate was damaging because it ’s new information it ’s damaging because it confirms what the voters already saw
correct which is perfectly fine tbh plenty of people voted for trump in 2016 because he was n’t hilary i do n’t think anyone has a problem with people doing that it ’s the fact that people wanted to and worked to silence you if you had any sort of criticism against biden
i told my wife i had no desire to watch it trump would lie his ass off and biden look like a feckless old man but i ended up watching about 15 mins because the wife put it on went somehow both how i expected and also worse
lol this stupid subreddit was saying trump would n’t even show up because biden would destroy him in the debate
are you telling me what i saw and heard with my own tqo eyes last night did not happen the gaslighting is very real with the neoliberals today
are you shocked that biden ’s performance is strongly correlated to whether a teleprompter is involved
having mental decline issues does n’t mean the person shows outwardly shows said issues at every single waking point of their lives that stuff can tend to come and go it was certainly present last night as bad as it ’s ever been and it ’s happened many times before jesus the water carrying is ridiculous
both can be true do n’t just deflect off to trump here i see what you ’re trying to do
reading a teleprompter ala ron burgandy is a much different proposition than thinking on one 's feet in a live debate setting
like beating medicare biden did n't talk once about solutions to problems just tried to attack trump and gave some jumbled word soup about what he 's done and how he 'll keep doing it which was barely understandable no solutions from either candidate on issues plaguing americans our democracy is now a complete joke and we 're stuck with a felon and a man who ca n't function
same candidate running he needs to gain more votes to not lose like in 2020 with republicans tripling down on abortion he ’s losing even more support where ’s he getting this sudden massive shift in voters black voters claiming biden is senile like he has since biden announced his 2020 run did n’t work out in 2020 either
yeah the right wing has no policies they have goals and they sit in wait for moments to pounce the real truth is america lost last night in total in truth everyone should be worried and considering a complete refresh but the real danger is trump
voting third party is a vote for biden depending on your perspective
a fox stooge says what
the border the border that republicans did n’t want to secure either you ’re not the brightest bulb or being dishonest
newsom 's not going appeal much to the conservative leaning independents because he 's associated with california and ultra liberalism gun control covid lockdowns etc despite being a moderate california has also not fared particularly well under him largely due to factors beyond his control but some due to insufficient or ineffective responses homelessness and economic dislocation are among the most politically visible whitmer faces similar perception problems particularly because of the publicity giver her lockdown orders and to a lesser extent gun control she does however have the advantage of coming from a large swing state harris consistently polled lower than biden in favorability and is even less known than most vp 's she 's recently put a lot of time into exposing sexual violence by hamas but the pro israeli alignment that will imply to some voters some of whom point out the decades of sexual violence against palestinians by the idf which goes unmentioned will actually exacerbate the weakness with young and muslim voters caused by uninterrupted shipments of offensive weapons to israel i think either of the first two would have had a better chance of winning than biden if biden had never run or had dropped out very early maybe even all three but at this point whatever benefits they bring to the table over biden and in no case would it only be benefits it is simply too late to switch candidates and expect them and the democratic party to have much legitimacy with independent voters
great defense of your savior of democracy
due to joe ’s weak performance this far many women do n’t know that in 2024 either
how anyone reaches that conclusion after reading my post will remain a mystery
i ’ll let the fda do all the evaluations on my medications and vaccines not some internet randos or dingbats kennedy would appoint thank you very much
but right now we 're not even allowed to evaluate good or bad vaccines define a bad vaccine give me an example since you are so convinced they exist the point you are missing by a mile by claiming there are bad vaccines is that there are massive safety and efficacy trials both in the us and abroad you do n't get to bring a vaccine to market without it be rigorously tested blockchain should not be used in any capacity with the federal government they ca n't get drug and black market money out of bitcoin how the hell do you think it will eliminate corruption tell me again how many banks have collapsed because the founders did something skeevy with the crypto currencies any attempt to use blockchain for governmental oversight is naive at best and outright dangerous otherwise
i think kennedy has an advantage on governing because of the brain worm two minds are better than one but his opinions and policies are n't too great
get mad because a stranger refuses to vote what did i say that made you think i 'm mad i was given one dude in the primary biden that 's my exact point why do you feel like you 're only allowed to vote for a dem or republican you said you 're tired of dems putting weak people up there yet you still vote for them like a good sheep who 's the weak pleb
somehow america got amnesia watching the debate and forgot trump never offered anything to the american people besides revenge for him and how he 's a victim biden on the other hand lowering costs of families ’ everyday expenses more people are working than at any point in american history making more in america rescued the economy and changed the course of the pandemic rebuilding our infrastructure historic expansion of benefits and services for toxic exposed veterans the first meaningful gun violence reduction legislation in 30 years protected marriage for lgbtqi and interracial couples historic confirmation of supreme court justice ketanji brown jackson and federal judges of diverse backgrounds rallied the world to support ukraine in response to putin ’s aggression strengthened alliances and partnerships to deliver for the american people successful counterterrorism missions against the leaders of al qaeda and isis executive orders protecting reproductive rights historic student debt relief for middle and working class families rescheduled marijuana advanced equity and racial justice including historic criminal justice reform delivering on the most aggressive climate and environmental justice agenda in american history but yeah john stewart is telling me one bad night for biden means democracy is over give me a break i 'm voting biden
i have never liked biden i was down for elizabeth warren but here we are you telling me i ’m reactionary because i ’m terrified the orange turd is going to be president again because the other choice is weak that ’s kinda trumpy of you
spoken like a true diehard democrat solider who 'll die defending their team sad there 's millions like you who are either diehard republican or democrat supporters why even shlep out candidates when the majority of people will vote for their respective team no matter what
the primaries are over the decision is in the hands of joe biden and elected democrats whatever you type about it online right now does n’t really matter
you 're 100 % correct the amount of people on here die hard defending biden is ridiculous the whole world watched last night and saw the same thing this is a man who can not function as a candidate
spare me the sanctimony you just said out loud that you will vote for fascism if you do n’t get your way
to r politics perhaps voters do n't actually fall for that all that frequently
exactly the moderators were a joke last night
who the fuck are these so called undecided voters we already know what the smelly rapist is capable of he ’s telling us out loud he will shred our constitution and become a dictator he tried to overthrow our government stole state secrets was found guilty of fraud and rape and continues to encourage his cult to commit violence in his name who the fuck ca n’t decide between that and a dude who might be a little too old but still wo n’t plunge our country into chaos
nonsense anyone to whom that makes sense is already a republican you 're confusing undecideds with republicans
these excuses are n’t going to win an election they are n't excuses i 'm stating historical realities you deny that at the peril of your own credibility and this debate is n't going to win or lose the election either biden posted a massive fundraising haul last night during and after the debate and the only place people are dooming is on social media and in the punditry class actual focus groups with undecided voters have n't shown the flight from biden that reddit promised me would occur saying that biden ca n't communicate is a bald faced lie when he just gave a rally in nc where he was on fire you 're deliberately only seeing what you want to see
oh the old i m rubber you 're glue the video of it is literally out there nice attempt to gaslight ill say again i 've watched his state of union speeches and many of his other speeches what am i pretending is n't happening when he does a good job and is n't a bumbling old fool unable to talk like fox news makes him out to be what am i pretending is n't happening when i saw him make plenty of good points throughout the debate last night while you pretend he was drooling all over himself speaking in tongues the number of concern trolls out today is insane
here are the questions you ignored and then claimed i 'm ' water carrying ' what am i pretending is n't happening when he does a good job and is n't a bumbling old fool unable to talk like fox news makes him out to be what am i pretending is n't happening when i saw him make plenty of good points throughout the debate last night while you pretend he was drooling all over himself speaking in tongues the bad faith arguments and concern trolling are what s ridiculous
trump literally wears diapers and everyone who has been around him says he smells like actual shit let 's bffr they 're both old
it ’s an election you ’re picking between two candidates it ’s an apt comparison
the idea that the idea that the idea that
the fact that that one line is all people like you could focus on out of an hour long debate speaks volumes
maybe it 's not that trump is gaining more it 's that biden is losing his a vote not cast for biden is a vote for trump addition by subtraction
i would love a refresh so much right now if only we could call timeout on the whole thing and actually work together on a proper solution to this madness
and i ’m delusional choose between two evils but do n’t choose that evil right
the same ones that wanted to build a giant wall across the most major port of illegal entry
yes your cognitive dissonance is apparent keep being utterly baffled that there are people that do n’t share your views and keep calling them “ insane ” people clearly you think running the clinton campaign again is the best path forward this neo liberal exceptionalism is exactly what put the party in the position it is in now
i ’ll just point out that the covid vaccines were not rigorously tested nonetheless i took 3 of them and think they were helpful
that is a solid zinger
well it ’s not like i ’m voting for trump but would n’t it be nice to have a candidate that wo n’t lose
it ’s not about you dude or me or any other person that is willing to crawl across glass to vote against trump in november whether it ’s for biden whitmer newsom or the fucking ghost of fdr it ’s about the people who are actually going to decide the elections the 1 3 % of voters that could go either way and they saw grandpa joe out there struggling to stay on a train of thought and think that maybe they stay home or vote trump that ’s the problem that the democrats denying that the conditions of the race shifted last night are failing to grasp
i mean republicans are offering a rapist independent are offering brain worms democrats are old guy think i 'm going with the old guy you got someone in mind
i see very few people defending biden except for last night on the cspan phone lines it 's the people who are like i 'll vote blue no matter who who are bugging me like i get it you 're totally checked out your vote effectively has already been cast fantastic i wish it was so easy for me the thing is there 's a problem that needs solving and considering you 've already voted give the other people room to talk
nope but your one dimensional thinking is exactly why we 're gon na lose a protest vote in a state biden is n't going to win is n't a vote for fascism but keep berating the people that have major concerns i 'm sure it 'll work out well for democracy
why do you think dark triad people rise to such positions of power it 's confidence candidates also tend to be on the taller side as well with the average presidential height being somewhere in the six foot range this is above the average height as people see them as more confident and in control
cnn polls on performance had trump up two to one it ’s hard to do much worse than that
that was n't their job it was biden 's
honestly do you talk to people around you neighbors family coworkers not everyone lives in a liberal bubble there are people who are genuinely undecided
just looked at a few clips from that he does look very good even the lighting made him look younger and he was honest about the performance while being firm about still being able to do the job that ’s exactly what he needs to do in every single chance from now on and we have a chance
i 'm growing really sick and tired of reading people defend this bullshit biden literally could n't finish a fucking thought mid sentence less than 10 minutes in to the debate i struggled to make sense of literally 90 % of the words he was putting together anytime he talked shit he did okay because that 's something joe has done his entire life but anytime he had to answer a question off the cusp blank as hell it was horrible and people like you need to stop gaslighting us into thinking it was something it was n't i 'm fucking pissed at his performance and at the democratic party for allowing such an old and frail man to go toe to toe with trump who spends his life doing pretty much exactly what he had to do on that debate stage lie and dance around every question asked of him i 'm pissed this bullshit could cost us our democracy
what are you even talking about i saw the debate and i heard the debate you ca n't try and make me think i saw and heard something i did n't biden did not look good at all and you 're really not looking good for trying to deflect here like i do n't think you understand what gaslighting is if you 're the democratic party we are fucked rubber and glue you just used the word i accused you of beung right back at me like a child without explaining anything you 're the worst president no you 're the worst president nono you 're the worst president ever nooope you 're definitely the worst president ever that 's basically what we got last night two senile old babies
it ’s not about age yes they ’re both old but trump can form coherent sentences and biden ca n’t
people like you do you even hear yourself i can focus on many more failing at getting the correct magnitude of different numbers bringing up immigration when asked about roe v wade talking about people being raped by their sisters and brothers it was a mess mate i 'm a stauch progressive i 'm just not delusional
and where are we seeing that the folks that said they ’d protest vote in the primary but vote for joe in the actual election abortion rights are motivating voters to rally and we ’ve seen it at again a place that matters the ballot box
if someone was going to vote trump then decided to vote third party by your logic they are not voting for trump when they would so it 's a vote for biden of course i do n't believe that a vote is for you who vote for simple as bullshit theory does n't change reality
they had a comprehensive bill ready to go to biden and republicans self tanked it because of trump
they were not years of trials but one of the largest studies in human history with a tiny side effect rate great efficacy and saved millions
lose oh i 'm sorry this is the first that i heard biden lost his presidency to donald trump
i agree i 'm very concerned about biden i 'm more concerned about trump i ca n't vote for either of these men to be honest i want someone who actually has a semblance of a plan or solution
we all lose if the smelly rapist gets in the choice is pretty clear fascism or a frail old man you ’ve already declared you ’ll vote for fascism so i really do n’t give a fuck what else you have to say
people too much power in confidence and charisma i put those in quotes because too many people are unable to see when the conman is putting on a show
the moderators absolutely have a duty to push back on blatant lies the smelly rapist did n’t even answer any of their questions he just kept pivoting to bullshit and rehearsed talking points
those people are either complete fucking morons or too embarrassed to admit they ’re voting for the smelly rapist
i think their point is the abundance of ignorance it would take is unfathomable to most which i agree with
explain his state of the union speech then
i do n't think it can be quantified in 13 hrs how much damage was done last night
ooh you definitely showed him how much of a better person you are i ’m also a good person like you is n’t it great being so morally righteous god it feels so fucking good
a conman gets away with it because he has confidence and charisma those traits have no bearing on morality or truth they are simply traits that can make a good man seen great and a horrible man seem good
that was biden ’s duty do n’t make excuses for his pathetic performance it is no one else ’s fault
not every voter is knowledgeable about trump and biden so yes there are undecided voters
you do n't understand the difference between reading off a teleprompter and unscripted remarks
in june the only people watching were idiots like us looking at anything this early it ’s amazing seeing folks claim the media suddenly turned on biden they ’ve been doing it since biden announced his second run biden does something good and there ’s countless articles on “ how this is actually bad for biden ” people were on suicide watch when obama had a less than stellar debate against romney fucking obama it gets clicks and views
the discussion was about forming coherent sentences which we 've seen biden do
i ’m saying that it ’s harsh to call people who might be disengaged with politics “ fucking morons ” some people do n’t follow every in and out of american politics and vote on a whim party etc
if that 's the hill you wanna die on then we 're already fucked btw he does n't even meet that bar because his speechwriter formed the sentences lmao he 's just reading them without the teleprompter he 's shockingly incoherent for a retail job let alone potus
are you fucking dense he brainlessly reads off a teleprompter holy shit these voters
the impact could be substantial on either campaign said bernie porn pollster for epic mra what a name
i ’ve no idea post debate but before these polls claiming trump ahead in michigan are complete bs we have literally turned mi blue over the last election cycles governor ag sec of state all won by double digits last election control over congress for the first time in decades bills brought by the people of the state to amend our constitution for both abortion rights and voter rights again by huge margins but yeah polls say trump was ahead complete bs
this debate was a massive mistake and not simply because of biden ’s performance trump is a despicable traitor who belongs in prison and he never deserved to share the stage with the potus
those numbers do n't look good there are two polls with and without third parties and this was pre debate
i wonder how his using “ palestinian ” as a slur will go down in michigan ’s arab community
i think biden will win michigan but this poll is hardly a good sign for the campaign is 600 respondents enough to be statistically significant
bro here using results from 4 years ago to discount recent polls in his view the same party wins every election then
trump won michigan 8 years ago he lost it 4 years ago due to losing support in oakland and western wayne if biden 's support in dearborn and detroit slips combined with never trumpers in the burbs staying at home michigan will flip back to trump
biden is unpopular because people blame him for inflation but that blame does n't seem to extend to other democrats we ca n't put our heads in the sand and yell fake news that only gets us a mouth full of sand just look at his favorability ratings they 're horrific and that was before the debate
i disagree does n’t change the fact that i ’ll still hate vote for biden in 2024 just like i hate voted for him in 2020 and hate voted for hilary in 2016 just validated what i have been saying to everyone for 8 years now he is too damn old
well too bad because it looks like the democratic party has decided it 's going to stick with the octogenarian
i do n’t think michigan arabs were big trump fans before the debate
i was in michigan recently and the people i know there told me that the arab communities hate trump and plan to vote against him
they are n't fans of either biden or trump most likely will go third party
yes but its reliability depends on factors like margin of error population size response rate and methodology i think 1 000 or more respondents are considered more reliable for national polls while 600 can be sufficient for smaller populations
that ’s a whole lot of if’n you ’re doing there
biden is picking up support in the up
the reality in mi is that the support for democrats is huge now and it ’s based on the platform and not a single person all those positions in michigan that won by double digits yeah polls show they were really close there too it ’s not “ yelling fake news ” to point out that polls are wrong and do not reflect actual reality you trying to state “ facts ” about michigan based on polls or your feelings about why you think he ’s unpopular is just not credible information
this is such a weird beef so many have the guy is the incumbent president that beat the other candidate already why would the dnc try to replace him it makes no sense why would they back another candidate over the incumbent president
fine i 'm not voting for biden again he 's too fucking old y'all want to suffer through another 4 years of trump project 2025 sounds like a blast neither of these men belong in the oval office and i 'm not going to vote for either of them
they do n't have to vote for trump all that have to do is stay home and trump wins mission accomplished
not particularly there is a lot of national polling pre debate showing slipping of support for biden in the aa voters and the arab american vote is n't thrilled with the current administration either trump does n't need to flip votes his cultists will still vote for him biden needs to maintain the 2020 coalition this was going to harder due to the economic disgruntlement let alone the debate performance
imo 2016 was an anomaly the majority of america thought don had no chance and sat out we wo n’t make that mistake again
michigan will be won or lost in detroit turnout and the votes in oakland wayne
is this what they call copium
you have absolutely zero to back your assertions up besides your disbelief in the evidence polls may have been wrong about the popularity of local democrats but those democrats are n't saddled with the worst inflation in decades and do n't have approval ratings in the 30s all evidence points to biden being significantly less popular than democrats as a whole and you have n't provided any evidence to the contrary and need i remind you that the polls were wrong in the other direction in 2016 just because they underestimated democrats previously does n't mean they will do so again
he beat trump by less than 40k votes when you look at the electoral margins by his own admission biden has lost a step since then and the polls are worse for biden compared to 2020 no reasonable person would take this bet
i am still voting for whatever democrat is running against trump it 's the only logical thing to do
that ’s awesome man way to make a decision based on feelings and not reality lol
i ’m sure you ’re going to feel so great about standing for your “ principles ” when trump and his shitbag toadies turn the country into a fascist theocracy what a rational way to act great work
and there was still a glimmer of hope amongst some people that he would n't be as bad as he seemed i doubt that 's the case now
again tho the guy is the president do u really want or expect the dnc to rally around someone else i voted for bernie in 16 and 20 ftr but he lost and biden won now we have to buck tf up and preserve of our country for another four years
i 'll vote for any democrat without dementia
dementia is nt a feeling it 's a sad degenerative disease
if the dnc thought this election was so important they would n't be running a candidate with dementia
do u really want or expect the dnc to rally around someone else yes and it is not unreasonable to want a serious debate about this a lot of people like me have consistently been saying this for over a year now 1 biden should n't run again and 2 whoever runs we have to beat trump the polling and recent debate performance has only solidified this opinion it is not too late to change course
ok buddy we get it you ’re so smart do n’t forget to remind yourself that it ’s all the dnc ’s fault while you slowly watch your rights whittled away in favor of corporations and the billionaire class i ’m sure they wo n’t target you though so nothing to worry about
then that ’s a foolish expectation
the pod save america guys do n't think this is foolish the nyt editorial board does n't think this is foolish the only people calling this foolish right now that i 've heard are anonymous redditors
biden 's a shitty debater but a good president he 's still got my vote and in his defense there were parts of the debate where i had the jaw dropped blank stare from trying to comprehend trump 's bullshit
yeah the tactic has turned into gaslighting about biden trying to pretend it was just an off night or it was n’t that bad he was just a little low on energy it ’s a cnn conspiracy like we did n’t all see the same stuff on tv
it ’s wild how the whole narrative around the debate has been “ biden old ” and not trump lying about literally everything with zero pushback or fact checking
it 's now or never pick a lane
as they should not the country needs to call for the felon to drop out
0 discussion in these replies about the logistics of changing candidate 0 discussion about what to do about the already legally committed delegates for biden from primaries that have already been decided
the msm are always quick to sell the narrative of democrats turning on their own republicans would rather eat their own children than turn on trump
yes we are the powerful are not
well i am but as the dems showed us in 2016 our opinions do n't matter
just give biden a disconnected game controller already
we should be demanding the convicted felon step aside
russell berman “ congressional democrats are n’t ready to demand that president joe biden quit his bid for reelection after a debate performance that was almost universally panned but for the first time some of them are taking the possibility seriously “ the debate was a serious setback ’ senator peter welch of vermont told me by phone yesterday it ’s up to president biden and his campaign to demonstrate that they do in fact have the energy for another four years ’ “ representative jared huffman of california a democrat serving his sixth house term told me that thursday ’s matchup between biden and donald trump was probably the worst debate i ’ve ever seen ’ when we spoke by phone yesterday i asked huffman if biden should stay in the race “ i do n’t know ” he replied i think a lot of us are trying to let this sink in and do some processing ’ “ both welch and huffman were alarmed that the performance of the 81 year old incumbent his voice quiet and shaky his answers often digressive and incomprehensible only intensified voters ’ concerns about his fitness for office the question he ’s always had to address is the age issue and that was not mission accomplished ’ welch said ” read more
and there is n't any reason for him to quit yes he had a not great debate as much as i do n't like st ronnie he had a bad first debate in 1984 and still won
he lost a lot of peoples votes thursday and it ’s crazy that people do not feel a sense of urgency to replace him he is not going to win after that people need to stop rationalizing because any centrist democrat with a functioning brain will steamroll trump
it ’s not just that he ’s a shitty debater lol he sundowned this is elder abuse at this point
biden also was able to explain his policies he was just terribly inarticulate when he did so and voters do n’t care about the intricacies of your policies anyways so it was n’t the best strategy even he had been completely articulate
biden believes in a message of policy merit and truth he was going into that debate expecting good faith from trump to at least debate on merit and policy or at the bare minimum talk about ideas relating for the future relating to the question asked that 's where he was wrong he 'll know better next time ignore the troll do n't fall for the bait pretend like he is n't even talking edit hey brigaders your psy ops is n't working very well and your ai responses are shit
because politics is a fucking sport now substance does n’t seem to matter anymore just optics one of the dudes up there was way more coherent but everything he said was a huge lie fucking scary
trump lies everyone knows it it 's not shocking it 's not surprising biden seeming like he should be on a silver alert poster the entire time was surprising
there has been plenty of talk about trump lying
trump really jumped onto the nazi express with all that vitriol towards migrants biden migrant crime young women are being raped and killed the country is a rat 's nest every state is a border state millions and millions of illegals are voting and stealing your healthcare
y'all are just being willfully ignorant at this point the reason biden 's performance is existentially bad is precisely because trump was so awful yet biden was completely ineffective at countering any of it y'all sitting here crying about cnn not fact checking trump when biden should 've been the one doing it he ca n't even give a verbal beat down to a moron like trump in a low stakes environment but we 're supposed to expect he can dominate the likes of putin xi or netanyahu in conflicts that can spark into a world war most people would not trust biden to drive them to the supermarket but we 're supposed to accept him piloting the entire nation absolutely ridiculous
they both need to drop out
i disagree i 'll provide precisely as much support and citation for my stance as you did 1
he is a shitty debater now it is n't offensive or wrong to say that anymore than to say that a 83 year old athlete is n't competitive
an explanation that is inarticulate is n't a good one by definition so you meant to say biden strugglingly presented his policies
yep he talked about taxing a thousand trillionares in laws raping each other and beating medicare
yup he told us all about beating medicare come on we all saw the same thing biden was n't inarticulate he was incoherent
the intricacies of a policy can be misused to mystify the public in a see it 's so complicated you would n't get it way and the public is rightly suspicious of that the general public either does n't know what they ira is or they know that it cost a trillion dollars and it makes their electric bill more expensive the majority of a public has not been sold on it at all and you can not win an election on the satisfaction of a minority that does want electric bills to go up
i ’m still amazed they agreed to debate at all
because politics is a fucking sport now maybe so but it would be just as sporting to score donald trump 's lies so that does n't explain why joe biden gets all the crap a more apt explanation would be that media in general prefer donald just like happened in 2016 when a huge deal was made of the notorious ' hillary 's emails ' that never amounted to anything or like in 2004 when howard dean was ridiculed out of the primaries because media played a distorted mic recording more than 700 times to name two examples in the big sea
i ’ve only seen one network fact check all his lies
yeah you may be right biden has done a lot of good things in a short period of time his decline is noticeable but i ’m ready to vote for a poodle before the fascist felon
no bro he literally has dementia and is not competent to even speak a sentence let alone run a country
i did n’t say he had a good performance he had an objectively bad performance but he was able to explain his policies despite what some people seem to be suggesting
he immediately corrected his trillionaires mistake by saying billionaires instead and are you arguing that relatives even through marriage do n’t commit rape you ’re also ignoring his other responses where he did in fact explain his policies
in that singular response yes but that was n’t the entire night so why are you being disingenuous and acting like it was
because it ’s down right terrifying watching a man who is supposed to be a leader of a country visibly exhibit that amount of cognitive decline meanwhile most rational humans understand the media portrays trump as having every possible character flaw under the sun to the point of it being borderline comical if trump never ran for president you would n’t be calling him a liar or a racist or have any of the opinions of him you do now all those thoughts were injected into your brain and you believed it because you wanted to be right they were putting this dude in rap songs before the elections
he got a question about abortion maybe his strongest policy area and he started talking about immigrants who kill women
because it was if that was any gop candidate you would be agreeing with me but it 's biden so dems have to deny what they saw with their own eyes and ears to defend him you have to be able to acknowledge that or you 're no better than the gop
in 1968 and 1980 and 1992 an incumbent faced a serious primary challenge then the party who challenged the guy lost the election replacement failed every single time in 2012 and 2016 a nominee faced unusually loud calls to step down and be replaced late but times that person won the election calls to step down were wrong every time despite all that reality there is a band wagon insisting that the guy who won the primaries be summarily dismissed and replaced by essentially a cabal of insiders and somehow that person will buck history and win it 's not happening all those thoughts were injected into your brain this is a personal attack sort of like the kinds made by donald trump during the debate you sound like trump and you campaign against the guy who was nominated to run against him the only way donald trump can get back into power is through the strategy of the heritage foundation to discourage or reduce turnout all this discord on the other side can only serve to help reduce turnout and help donald back in
you ’re just being disingenuous he did n’t make one mistake on the first response and stay silent the rest of the debate he absolutely explained his policies in other responses but like i said he was terribly inarticulate in doing so you have to be able to acknowledge that or you 're no better than the gop biden was more on topic than trump so i do n’t know what you ’re trying to suggest
so dems have to deny what they saw with their own eyes and ears to defend him i 'm not a dem and i agree that he was n't inarticulate all night sounds like you 're biased
yeah he was only losing his train of thought and mixing up words and looking confused and looking vacant and staring into the distance with his mouth open and changing subjects randomly and trailing off and friend he looked and sounded and spoke like an 81 year old it was n’t just he bumbled around a bit and was inarticulate it was an absolute unmitigated disaster
friend he looked and sounded and spoke like an 81 year old well he is an 81 year old so i ’m not sure what you were expecting
do you have an actual argument to make or just personal attacks
not demented maybe jesus crist how can we possibly move the bar lower maybe next president should be someone with downs syndrome
even with the debate debacle biden seems to garner more positive views than kamala
she thinks she ’s going to be the next president most of america hopes she gets swapped out
dems and the vp missed the boat back in 2022 when desantis started the heritage foundation 's woke initiative that was a precursor to project 2025 linking these horribly evil corrupt wealthy cabal members and the politicians they own to the problems working americans are facing should be a no brainer vp harris should have shown up at the alec meeting in orlando last july to denounce project 2025 this is where the koch cabal republican politicians campaign donors lobbyist lawyers all met and discussed the roll out of project 2025 and the dems want to be heroes and git back lgbtq and abortion rights they let be taken she should be on tv every day demanding traitor who did you sell our secrets too what secrets did you sell what secrets do you still have why this has not been the standard phrase that comes out of every dems mouth when a microphone is in their face is beyond me
i like kamala but i really think they whiffed on her as vp and nothing in the last 4 years says i 'm wrong
most of the us voted for biden harris in the last election that means that they voted for harris to be president if anything happened to biden biden was old and doddery back then he looks like he could drop any time nowadays harris would have a clear mandate for the presidency in the event of biden keeling over or stepping down that ’s what people voted for if the ticket is biden harris in 2024 that ’s what they ’ll be voting for this time too
biden has press conferences every week but the media does n't cover them
no she should be in a grocery store every week in a different state talking to a mother about the price of items in the shopping cart james carville who got clinton elected had it right over and over it ’s the economy stupid ’
people voted for that ticket in spite of harris not because of her she is wildly unpopular if she ’s at the top of the ticket it would be a landslide for the gop according to polling
the primary reason i voted for biden was the alternative i would have voted for biden if his running mate was my daughter 's cat i do n't think harris taking over was a consideration to very many voters
i think we were voting against trump in 2020 so the situation is a little different now harris was n’t popular in the democratic primary so you can be assured that no one was voting “ for ” her dems have to realize that the situation is different now biden is clearly not fit for another term and harris would not win as top of the ticket
2020 presidential candidates number 2 3 4 and 5 ganged up on number one to elect numbers six and seven any other take is foolish 1 bernie 2 warren 3 buttigieg 4 klobeshar 5 bloomberg 6 biden 7 harris
any idea why she ’s unpopular i ’m fine with her edit why are legitimate questions downvoted without comment again can anyone explain why she ’s unpopular her record as vp is quite good people i know like her she has high approval among african americans is this a forbidden question
oh i totally understand that harris does n’t have the hearts and minds of the democrat voters but she does legally have their mandate to step up if biden steps down the dems ca n’t just say “ well we had our fingers crossed behind our backs when we voted biden harris and did n’t really mean the harris part ” does n’t work like that another problem is that asking harris to step aside in favour of a white guy because “ we did n’t really mean biden harris ” is terrible optics for black voters
that might well be true does n’t change the outcome harris was legitimately elected as the vp
i think during her campaign lots of hypocrisy was uncovered around her personal use of marijuana and her prosecutorial history as da that ’s the only specific thing i can remember right now though
every national politician is unpopular this is true in virtually every other western country as soon as anyone becomes the democratic nominee the 24 7 right wing propaganda machine will attack that candidate also progressive podcasters will start showing how the candidate does n’t pass their purity test and will have the left angry towards that candidate the best bet is kamala harris right now and she is actually coherent and her age could not be used against her biden needs to give up the reigns to her and i actually think there will be an announcement sometime over the next two weeks where biden steps down and chooses her as the nominee at least i ’m hoping this happens otherwise it does n’t look good
i think she is just as mediocre as most other vps over the last 50 years i think a lot of her ' unpopularity ' is msm social media noise that builds upon itself i certainly do n't remember anywhere the number of vp popularity polls as we 've had the last four years
i do n’t like das who keep innocent people in jail by withholding evidence
i anticipate downvotes but i ’ll go there anyway for the sake of giving you an honest answer gop does n’t like that she ’s a person of color woman from uber liberal california and is out of step with mainstream ideals our country has dems do n’t like her because her history as a lawyer and district attorney did n’t protect the people they care most about as well as not being even more progressive than they hoped as a counter action to biden historically moderate rest of america does n’t like her because she ’s whiny not particularly strong on any specific policy or an expert on anything and when tasked with taking the lead on fixing immigration border has fumbled it mightily
but she does legally have their mandate to step up if biden steps down as president for the 20 24 term not as candidate for the next one it 's a courtesy that she 'd get dibs to run not a legal mandate
i never wanted harris i did n’t choose her for vp biden did
how do you feel about real estate slumlords trying to get five proven innocent people executed
i guess perfection is required of poc and women
this convention is going to be wild black voters do n’t care about harris in my estimation “ she ’s a cop ” is what i ’m hearing
yes i understand that a lot of dem voters feel that way about harris they might not have had harris in their hearts when they voted biden harris but they did vote for biden harris
good to know presidents only have to function from 10a 4p definitely do n’t keep them up after bedtime
battle of the dementia candidates they both need a walker and can barely string a sentence together both parties need people decades younger
the past 36 hours showcased two joe bidens the veteran president rallying voters in a swing state and an 81 year old man struggling to string thoughts together in a debate no it 's the same guy he 's capable of reading off a teleprompter and putting on a show but completely incapable of thinking on his feet there 's a reason that he provides basically zero press access out of staged events like howard stern trying to act like a scripted rally shows a different guy is just spin
lmao we have a sundowning president
nope it 's one biden this is how it starts the pauses stuttering losing train of thought it starts out as a small hiccup then it 's mostly fine then gradually gets worse until they are incomprehensible remember diane fienstien telling everyone she was working when she had been in the hospital for like 3 months this is biden in decline next year it 's going to be so bad they wo n't have him go anywhere
from 10 am to 4 pm biden is dependably engaged and many of his public events in front of cameras are held within those hours
i think the difference is the crowd immediately after the debate he went to a watch party full of people and was full of energy not a sign of the tottering old man who ’d just embarrassed himself in the debate
trump is really the best option for this country out of these two
joe biden contains multitudes look it up
better than not functioning 24 7
they also need a teleprompter to be able to complete a sentence
facts dude can barely walk down the stairs now with any help
it 's crazy to think of biden lasting 4 more years in office like literal insanity that this is the choice the fucking democrats gave us
he naturally has a and the pauses are for him to try and get his words out not to mention he ’s had two brain in his life and i ’m sure that has affected some aspects eta sources since people seem to think i pulled this information out of my butt
please for 4 years trump spent all his time watching fox news
you ’re wrong trumps a traitor fuck him
fuck no i 'd elect biden 's corpse before somebody actively trying to destroy the country disastrous that we 're already losing abortion access and their plans get so much worse also the part where he wants to be a dictator democrats should have chosen better but trump literally just sucks that bad that there 's still no voting for anyone else
all other criticisms aside and there are plenty the teleprompter smugness is so unforgivably ignorant and i have to say something even a young spry president would need to give hundreds of public comments per month and i would honestly rather they spend their precious time between managing national security and creating political end roads as opposed to memorizing a bunch of speeches they ’ll never give again it sure seems like the teleprompter criticism is based on an imagination that fails completely to comprehend the scale of the job of president or at least the logistic landscape of memorizing dozens of speeches per week
“ he ’s demented but at least he ’s not trump ” may work for this subreddit but it ’s not going to be enough to win the election
i sympathize for him unfortunately he needs to removed from the ballot though if we want even the tiniest semblance of a possibility of winning this election keeping biden in between his abysmal approval rating and that humiliating first debate will be basically handing trump the election on a silver platter
so we should allow someone who ’s had brain damage be the president of the united states i see a lot of brain worm talk in this sub
you are n’t a serious person
what does that have to do with biden sundowning you really think a president with dementia is going to get out the vote if biden stays in trump will be re elected
so close this is a news article about the current president of the united states
no one is asking him to memorize speeches only to function like a normal human you know think and speak complete sentences
no one cares that he uses a teleprompter for speeches all presidents do the concern is that he is not able to answer questions using a complete coherent sentence or use critical thought without a teleprompter there s a reason he has quite fewer press conferences and public appearances than the last two presidents
i never claimed that the quality of presidential candidates is high we have a convicted felon and then a man who ’s extremely old but i ’d rather the latter over someone who wants to take rights away from pretty much every marginalized group moreover i ’m voting for the future of the supreme court
these are literal facts how does it not make sense to you that two aneurysms probably affected him lmaooo
i ’m appalled by all the defense of biden it ’s practically elder abuse at this point he ’s cooked
and specifically avoiding the other ex president running
i know that internet discourse is generally resistant to nuance but i ’m not interested in hyperbole biden functions well sometimes less so others not good enough for a president in my opinion which is why the dnc should have fronted someone else entirely and still should but that ’s not the point i was making the point i ’m making is specific and it ’s that getting uppity about teleprompters is patently a silly thing to do being annoyed that a politician uses a teleprompter is like being mad a construction worker uses scaffolding
maybe he should n’t be president
lest we forget who brought up the teleprompter bs in the first place oh it 's the guy who 's responsible for 90 % of the vitriol lies and obfuscation that conservatives perpetually regurgitate did n't see that one coming
losing to trump this time is gon na be the biggest fumble in political history
democracy is more important than an old man 's feelings fuck sake dude you 're 81 why was the decision to step down and just chill out not made years ago it may legitimately be too late now i do n't know but i refuse to believe these were the first signs behind closed doors
if you would ’ve said 12 years ago that the dems were going to face trump in 3 elections in a row even republicans would ’ve predicted 3 straight dem presidencies the only way we get here is if the dems refuse to accept that their candidates ’ popularity numbers are near historic lows and adjust if trump ran against virtually anyone else in any of these elections he ’d get killed that entire machine needs to be disassembled redesigned and overhauled its reliance on internal hierarchy rather than an honest appraisal of public opinion is consistently offering up garbage candidates when winning should be easy
look i 'm blue no matter who over here but seeing jill come out to escort joe off the stage after the debate made me so much more uncomfortable then her standing on the stage praising him for doing a good job like he was a child was even worse the optics of those moments just added to the perception he is a senile old man and killed my last shreds of hope that night
someone like whitmer or newsome has to have the balls to stand up and say joe is a good man but he needs to step down and pass them the torch for the race
tbh jill is starting to really bother me it ’s clear joe does n’t listen to anyone but her and she seems incapable of reading the room it comes off as just wildly out of touch this goes so beyond just one bad debate 2024 joe is not the same person as 2020 joe and he wo n’t get any better doing the job for another 4 years it was jill that gave him the green light to run again
i ’m glad that we ’re going to lose our democracy because jill biden wants to keep her proximity to power
do n’t tell me we have to save democracy and then make staying a power play selfish trumpish stepping down would be a patriotic move adding to his legacy btw it was n’t just a bad night e g “ we beat medicare ” yikes
may 29 jill biden says polls are going to turn ’ in favor of biden the first lady looked ahead toward the first debate which is set for june 27 and argued that the president will shine over trump “ i think the american people deserve a debate because you need to see your choices you need to see trump and you need to see the president and you need to see the differences and my husband and you ’re going to see how smart he is and the experience he has and then you ’ll see somebody who like you ’re saying i ’m going to use joy ’s words ca n’t put a sentence together ” she said in an apparent reference to comments made by co host joy behar about trump
what a joke these people are in positions of power for the wrong reasons they do n’t actually give a shit about the people they serve and they ’re too insulated and out of touch to see how bad this situation really is
that ’s disheartening if there was any voice on the inside begging him to step down you would think it was hers does she want to see this man die in front of a teleprompter
this country is doomed thanks to fucking jill biden ’s inability to see reality
she ’s a disgusting human being it ’s clear she cares more about the power of being in the oval office than the health and well being of her husband
jill biden on her hilary in 2016 shit lmao
if that ’s the case i really hope the donors start pulling out because as much as i like biden he is not in the state to be the president for 4 more years and i do n’t even want to think about the damage trump will do
total side note but why is the post itself getting downvoted yes we do n't like that jill is doing this but the article is quality and raising a good discussion i see this all over this sub and it 's mind boggling we ca n't separate i do n't like this news from this is not a good quality post article
i think she 's more worried about what it would do to him if he stepped aside rather than what it would do to the country if he loses to trump
disastrous debate one guy did n't have the energy you wanted the other guy fucking just lied with every word out of his mouth but it was the first guy that was a disaster i think i give up we 're fucking ruined
for ron klain a 62 year old with a career in washington who is considered responsible for most of the good things biden has been involved in to be referred to as not peers is fucking bizarre who the fuck is a peer he will listen to if not that dude
yes also she also calls herself a doctor she has a phd in english no one with that calls themselves a doctor
whelp he 's staying guys time to back up biden as much as we can because there 's no way that he will be persuaded to resign after his wife 's encouragement for him to stay in the race as the article said any attempt to persuade him to drop out without his wife 's his younger sister valerie 's support is futile let 's hope biden gets his shit together and proves everyone wrong for all of our sake edit an attempt to force him out by the delegates ' rebelling or a 25th admentment challenge right now would be very messy because biden controls his campaign 's funds and because he still has support of powerful allies like obama and bill clinton and because forcing him out after he already won the nomination breaks the rules it would much better if he drops out willingly if he 's asked
not american but i was thoroughly entertained i think its all over social media
terrible wife and person to keep sending her husband out like that just go she can stay first lady and keep her life style power not nearly enough is getting said about her right now
the telegraph reports has encouraged her husband to remain in the us election race despite mounting pressure on the president to step down after his disastrous debate night the first lady who has been married to mr biden since 1977 has emphatically told him they would “ stay in the race ” according to a report in the new york times “ her thinking according to people close to her was that it was a bad night and bad nights end ” the newspaper reported sources close to the president have said the next three or four days will be crucial in establishing whether ’s position is untenable after he repeatedly struggled to speak coherently during the debate however most of mr biden ’s closest advisers have also tried to put a brave face on the claiming he can make up any lost ground over the rest of the campaign the president put on a stronger performance in a rally on friday they point out at times the debate on thursday descended into farce as mr biden argued with his rival the former president donald trump about their golf handicaps and the quality of the democratic leader ’s golf swing even on lighter topics the president had difficulty expressing himself clearly and occasionally drifted off topic completely it came as a new poll reported by the axios news outlet suggested that 60 per cent of us voters believe mr biden should drop out of the race while a new york times editorial called upon the president to withdraw read more
probably after buying him some ice cream too
guys remember that we ’re voting for the future of supreme court
the face of the person who should be blamed come nov 5th
fuckin ’ twice dems keep nominating inept centrist ghouls and are surprised when that does n’t actually appeal to enough people to win an election the only reason trump lost in 2020 was because he bungled the pandemic and even then the margin of victory for biden was pretty thin
i ’m starting to not like her
joe biden is literally the only candidate that could lose this election and he ’s refusing to drop out after just proving to the world that their concern over his age is valid how is this happening
if you were going to tell me trump has become stronger as a candidate over time i would n’t believe you either but he has become just that objectively in polls if you told me he was n’t going to easily divide dems ’ base too also see above
whitmer is co chair of his campaign so that ’s not gon na happen
before the debate the claims of elder abuse seemed like hyperbole now it 's clear that the people around joe are failing him and the country
the video of her on stage telling him he did a great job gave me a sick feeling
surely swapping candidate at this stage is not an easy thing to do and probably risky we should not forget that 's it 's not only a president that will be elected but a whole administration i hope people remember what mess was trump 's administration
if the country is doomed it 's due to the american electorate period we will get the country we deserve
it ’s even more doomed that we have polls in our faces telling dems their own field is even less electable than biden against trump but denying that he would n’t be back here if it were n’t the case much as it sucks there ’s 4 months to go period some party surrogates lined up behind biden for years now do n’t want to share in biden ’s fate behind the curtain good or bad but are keen to distance themselves when allied with him for far longer too bad trump will make it about him so either help or get joe to do better or share in it
saying that an 81 year old with clear cognitive decline is just missing energy is like saying john kennedy got a headache when he went to that parade in dallas
she does n’t have a phd she has a doctor of education degree edd which carries even less clout
you think he will last another 5 years
nothing entertaining about a possible fascist dictator en route nothing if he wins
that 's a weird comment do you not like ice cream
people do forget about just how much the pandemic contributed to trump 's loss he mishandled a public health crisis an economic catastrophe in which hundreds of thousands perished and even became hospitalized by covid himself in october of the election year and still only lost by a few thousand votes in a few states
look at the virginia gov race that was run by an easily beatable republican but dems ran an absolute shit already had governor people did n’t care for and still ran an even shittier campaign for him get money out of politics and run what the people want it ’s not hard
“ the only reason ” you have a very limited recollection of a dumpster fire of an administration
only 27 % participated in the 2020 primary where we had a full slate of options it is apathy that is killing our nation not the democratic establishment
hey primary voters are n’t without blame
i think if you put a battleground governor ticket together you could pull off the win pa and mi in some combination would be my recommendation
only happens if they exclusively run trash obama or anyone remotely on his tier would repeatedly beat trump like a gong
newsom is also basically a biden surrogate since 2023 ish not happening
my god it was one of the worst things i had seen other than the actual debate itself we beat donald trump because joe answered all the questions like a good boy and because trump lied is this the bar for the presidency now
the media would be reporting on the candidate change constantly drowning out anything trump
it ’s not like biden was chosen for this round with a mandate or anything he was n’t challenged so he waltzed into the nomination his run this go around is deeply unpopular keeping him in is risky
and probably risky assuming it ’s not to a former republican the dnc wo n’t lose a single vote they have today for biden if they change they ticket
swapping candidates at this point would be complete electoral suicide
clear cognitive decline repeat the lie until you believe it champ
irrelevant he 's already lost we all know it america will not vote for someone who is senile and they would indeed rather have an incompetent convicted felon liar and rapist as president if your force them to choose it does nt matter how many times people repeat trumps ' negatives at this point the denial of this from some posters here makes them complicit in trumps re election
he does n't have to kamala can take his place if he dies
who are the replacements for biden the guy does n't seem like he will be able to walk for another 4 5 years its not too late to change candidates
trump only won by a few thousand votes in 2016 also
it 's risky for biden to talk covid stats since more died post trump and that was with a vaccine
oh i remember but a significant portion of the country misguidedly does n’t care about that
people would n’t be so apathetic if they were given decent candidates to vote for
obama ca n’t run again per the constitution and would n’t we ’ve heard all the names polling further behind trump and not even in moe 4 months out is too late to change the standard bearer
i 'm gon na say something crazy that i do n't expect to happen but would be thrilled about if it did joe should step aside and the party should nominate jill to run in his place
that sounds better than reporting on biden sundowning drowning out anything trump
keeping a guy that can barely form a coherent thought and that looks totally lost is electoral suicide
i do n't think it is just bring up the big disparity in deaths between red vs blue states
where do candidates come from
i do n’t know that it would remotely change anything tbh or help
what makes her remotely qualified to be president
and if the debate performance were indicative of that and not just a single bad night i might be inclined to agree with you he had a bad night no questioning that but the hot takes about what that bad night means are completely out of proportion watch the speech he gave in raleigh the next day he had a lingering cough clearly he had a cold the night of the debate and the stutter was a little worse than normal but by and large he was back to his normal self nobody in the state of mental decay that biden is claimed to be in would be capable of that but those are n't the clips that get endlessly posted and dissected and any evidence that does n't fall in line with the performative negativity is ignored
they can come from anywhere but sourcing a good one much less getting them to the national stage is a tall order then of course you have nepo babies people who buy their way in etc
that 's part of it though is n't it the worry about flipping a campaign completely on its head this late in the game whether it helps or not is the big question i think it would but i 'm not a campaign insider
she 's more qualified now than trump was in 2016 i 'm not sure it needs any further justification than that ideally you would want an experienced politician but that comes with a whole host of other problems as well newsom for example is highly qualified but a huge chunk of the nation would rather watch democracy die than vote for a california democrat think of the tax hikes s
having a bad night or a cold is a terrible excuse anyone who has an older family member with cognitive issues can instantly recognize the distant look he had in his eyes i saw his speech the next day and i 'm not convinced he was reading a teleprompter and not having to think cognitive issues get worse not better
there is literally an axios article out about how biden does n't function well after 4pm sundowning is a sign of dementia
i 'm as anti trump as anyone but i do n't see how changing joe 's diapers counts for anything
go back and read what biden actually said during the debate he may have been stuttering and speaking too softly and he did misspeak a few times but the substance of what he said does n’t show “ cognitive decline ” then go back and see what trump was actually saying he was loud and did n’t stutter but everything he said was complete nonsense nothing he talks about is based in reality biden is considered the loser of that debate because the standard for him to meet is so much higher than the standard trump is held to “ oh trump lied and rambled his way through racist and fear based non answers but that ’s what he always does biden on the other hand that ’s just inexcusable ”
anyone who has an older family member with cognitive issues can instantly recognize the distant look he had in his eyes yeah it 's a good thing the human brain does n't excel at false pattern recognition or anything and that once we 're committed to a narrative we do n't go psychologically all in on it to the point where we throw out all competing evidence or anything biden shows signs of aging but i say again nobody in the state of mental decay that you claim he is in could have made the speech he made yesterday and you 're not convinced well okay you can be as stubborn as you want about shit it does n't make your interpretation anywhere closer to reality
i think that 's a little dismissive of her own accomplishments but everyone is entitled to their opinions
but the thing is if even 5 % of people think this way and stay home it 's game over it does n't matter if they are wrong people are dumb and believe bullshit all the time this is a case of perception is reality for a non insignificant portion of people
well okay you can be as stubborn as you want about shit it does n't make your interpretation anywhere closer to reality this is a great analysis of your perspective
ah yes the classic no u retort my perspective accounts for his debate performance your perspective does not account for his raleigh speech we are not the same
did you miss the part where i said he was reading off a teleprompter but go ahead and keep insisting that an 81 yr old with clear cognitive issues is doing great your mindset is why we will lose this election
hoping to win with just the notion the biden is not trump is not going to work this election the democrat party needs to take action if they want win this year
he ca n’t recover from this the sooner he gets out the better
it was “ a bad night for biden ” as one european diplomat put it “ it is a sad reality that biden is old and he is getting older we saw it i had difficulties understanding what he was saying and i understand english pretty well ” said a second european diplomat “ trump ate him alive ” said an arab diplomat “ i was shell shocked i could not believe my eyes ” an asian diplomat said of biden ’s performance a ukrainian politician told cnn he found trump ’s statements on the war in ukraine “ worrying ” “ we ’re very concerned because we more or less understand what it means for ukraine a biden presidency and we really do n’t know what it means for ukraine a trump presidency ” oleksiy goncharenko told cnn “ it can be very good it can be very bad we just do n’t know and that ’s definitely concerning ”
it was horrifying to see biden struggle so much with his age i 'm a dem and i make no bones about what we all saw but the main source of the horror is the probability that biden loses voters and donors over this and we all have to suffer a malignant narcissist crime family in our whitehouse again
someone slipped biden a bennie
you have the attention and precision of a surgeon to have found all those little nuggets in trump 's lie a log
i ’m starting to find out both parties are the same one party haphazardly fixes things the other party destroys it so forth and so on both parties benefit from stocks as well as profiteering from covid and continued wars
voters will decide his fate in november
so nothing will happen to him obama clinton newsom whitmer shapiro prizker pelosi harris and clyburn etc have all come out to support him idk
the media is gon na hook on to this “ biden needs to step aside ” narrative because it ’s gon na get clicks and views it ’s dangerous ragebait and will do more to harm our democracy than the stuttering of joe biden
trump has convicted felonies but democrats struggle finding one person among 49 registered million dems to guarantee a landslide victory we should have a win on a silver platter but we do n’t
lol who is going to replace biden this nonsense about replacing him is exactly what trumpers want there 's so much brigading in this sub about removing biden and no one can offer a decent replacement that would actually want to run with 4 months left
when will these dipshits in the media realize that the democrats will never replace biden
apparently he is not capable of deciding his own fate which is quite telling
i see the sub is back to the business as usual of dnc talking points
i sure hope not there are many better choices donald trump is not a very popular candidate sure he has his little maga cult but there are a lot of republicans who do n’t even want to vote for him joe biden is quite literally the only person who could lose to him and november there are many better candidates no one is voting for joe biden we are all voting against trump
the people the article is referring to are in the first paragraph and there is no overlap with your list they 're not referring to political allies
has anyone considered that perhaps the dem establishment does n't want to win this election they are very comfortable with the notion of being in opposition and barking about the fascism that trump will bring while also not paying higher taxes on their considerable incomes everyone with even with a fractional brain knows that taxes would need to go up considering the fiscal sate of the country they do not care about trump destroying the federal institutions as long as they keep as much as they can in their accounts
if it 's a 25th amendment scenario it will likely be at the beginning of his second term kamala will take over and we can have a normal younger president
even if biden did well in the debates i am pretty sure all these articles were already writen and the media was waiting for a chance to use them biden is not perfect he would have slipped up eventually there is an argument to be made that getting this out of the way now may in fact work out in bidens favor at some point all these articles become noise
it is disappointing and frustrating that the media is normalizing disenfranchising voters only mn put up a decent protest vote voters already spoke in the primaries
i think trump supporters who watched the debate are thrilled that 's the guy trump running against
it is so tiring being accused of brigading for pointing out the obvious trumpers do not want biden replaced they are feasting on this debate failure and they have good reason to think they are winning right now you know who agrees with that take these guys do you think former obama aides are brigading too because that is just insane
if biden died there would be any number of good candidates willing to throw their hat in the ring what we saw the other night was a political death joe is n’t up to the job and needs to have this burden lifted from him only idiots will vote for trump but a lot of people who might have turned out against him will now stay home
why not the vp harris
agreed the only possibility i could see is newsom but he does n't exude confidence that he 'll unify the party in such a short time what i think biden needs to do is highlight his team and cabinet show that it 's not just him making decisions and that the country is in good hands should the worst happen it 's a contrast you could make well considering a significant number of trump 's cabinet have been charged with criminal offenses oh and every other sentence out of his mouth should be that trump is a fucking felons to me failing to mention that was the biggest failure of the debate forget the memes and stumbling
anything is better than a senile old man as trump is about to prove being an incompetent bufoon liar felon and rapist does that sound like a trump brigader to you or someone just being realistic
literally any top democrat trump is n’t a hard guy to beat biden is just the worst candidate anyone has seen in a very long time but yeah it only works if it starts with biden giving up power which is something most boomers struggle with especially career politicians
jill biden crazy definitely but might be crazy enough to work little no changes to campaign structure and staff she 's very popular in pa which is a must win state younger than trump no political baggage looking at you newsom
a lot of people want to replace biden look at the comments in the nytimes
then people here need to realize these democrats are complicit in giving trump another term if you force it to make the choice the us will indeed choose an incompetent liar felon and rapist over someone who is senile we all know it
it generates ads and clicks so never
dnc talking points so a you 're acknowledging there 's been an influx of non typical users since the debate trying to influence opinions and b dnc talking points is quite literally straight from fox news nobody coalesces around the party 's talking points like republicans please tell me what are dnc talking points do you mean the idea that replacing biden right now would be electoral suicide because that 's not a dnc talking point that 's reality the talking points i see are things along the tiresome lines of that 's it his political career is dead etc when it 's only june there 's plenty of time for biden to make up ground and trump to lose ground
joe biden is quite literally the only person who could lose to him and november this is just so ridiculous
the problem with most of these ditch biden people is they tend to ignore harris altogether i would love for her to take on the mantle but i do n't see that happening either
of course they are anyone who ca n't see this is in denial
i think people are in denial that there are no good options those that want him replaced understand replacing a candidate is not a good option but what people who want to keep biden are forgetting is that keeping biden is not a good option either there are no good options either way is a huge risk people who want biden to step aside are n't brigadiers trolls gop bots or russian trolls we are fearful of a trump presidency
i do n't see how newsom would win over moderates in swing states when he ca n't even win them in california someone like whitmer would probably be a better replacement what i think biden needs to do is highlight his team and cabinet problem is biden had a golden opportunity to do all of that in the debate and he squandered it and then some if biden is still on the ticket for the second debate he really needs to just ignore everything trump says and focus on his own platform i mean even hillary was saying that 's what he had to do i 'm not getting my hopes up that he and his term learn that though
what next i 'm going to hear michelle obama or the maker of psycho babble grifters oprah please stop
anyone not a shill talking about replacing biden is only considering people they like taking his place the fact is not everybody will get the person they like since that person is different to each individual they 're hoping for a savior that does n't exist
i ’m talking about posts like yours ideas like yours will lead us straight to another trump term
yeah he 's not the only one hillary 's right there
the reason for this is there are still old school democrats that have a hard time voting for a woman biden is harris 's vehicle to become president voters should be informed that all of biden 's work has been done by harris behind the wheel
exactly and i judge biden staying to be the greater risk right now there are a lot of unknowns with replacing him but the current path looks pretty bad i see no reason to believe it will look better for biden by november
whitmer is the only option because she brings with her at least one swing ec state perhaps two with wise shapiro is perhaps an ok 2nd choice but he has a smaller national profile
it ’s not that she ’s female but being married to a politician does n’t make you one and worse it plays into the conception that the democrats are this calcified stratified party where only the people who are related to or very close to certain families get to the top
maybe it 's hard to know for sure what swing republicans actually want this cycle i personally believe a large chunk of that elusive voting bloc will be motivated by abortion women 's rights if that 's the case i think having a white suburban woman is n't a deal breaker
whitmer newsom and harris are also right there per poll after poll rn it 's not a biden specific thing the race is only close with him on top it 's that dire a situation
but being married to a politician does n’t make you one being a tv game show host does n't either so i 'd love to hear republicans put that argument out there drain the swamp right oh no wait she is the swamp because she 's married to joe i guess that makes her qualified also george w bush jared kushner ivanka trump whatever eric 's dumb wife is named i agree with you in general but i think it 's a harder argument to make from a party that has completely given itself to one family who had no prior experience in politics
we do n’t need whataboutisms yes the republicans but this is about the democrats
the democrats who need to defeat republicans this whole panic over joe is because he opened himself up to republican attacks over his age and mental acuity i think it 's a mistake not to factor republican attacks into a potential replacement candidate
log cabin republicans confuse me like they have to know they are despised by their party right like gay religious folks who believe in the bible and the bible is very clear on what should happen to queer folk i am just baffled by the thought process
someone needs to tell him about project 2025
so he thinks he ’s going to flip nj ’s traditional political alignment on the issues just because he ’s gay i do n’t understand why that would change most votes
how long till this becomes a story in r leopardsatemyface
there 's no such thing as a gay republican this guy does n't have a snowball 's chance in hell with his own party
thanks to menendez he might actually do it although i do n't think it 's the likeliest outcome
gay republicans make as much sense as jewish nazis or black segregationists the gop hates gay people
i 'm gay and in the 90s was with a guy who two years into the relationship decided he was a republican and became involved with log cabin i went to a couple of their events and the thinking goes like this it would be better if both parties were open to supporting gay rights and the only way to make that happen is for conservative gays to counter the prejudicial thinking by creating change within the gop seeing how in the intervening decades the gop if anything got worse on gay rights it was wishful thinking and more than a little delusional but that was the idea
they like having the ability to yell slurs at other people and that 's a big draw of being a republican
why do you say there is no such thing there are still plenty of closeted self loathing gay people this seems kinda similar
lindsey graham has entered the chat
the best solution is to downvote and pretend all is well
biden may be old may take a stumble but he is n't a classified document tratior
i am still traumatized by that debate i firmly believe if corrupt donnie were to get back into the white house democracy will be over in this country i am pissed that biden is seeking re election because he is putting this country at great risk he was not only completely incompetent in that debate but it was actually disturbing for my family he was completely out of it and not at all competent it does n't have to be this way gavin newsom would have mopped the floor with donald
more money so they can buy more ads so that they can show more people who trump is
no harris polls better than biden with nonwhite and younger voters
would changing his vice president help convince independent voters to choose the democrats over the republicans it may only help if people know the vice president takes over if the president is unable to do the job
the best solution is to downvote and pretend all is well while i agree that pretending he did n't have a good debate is n't a good idea what exactly is the best solution
that ’s this subs solution for every article they do n’t like
when it is so obvious that the incumbent the twice primary winner and the guy who previously beat donald trump then surprised many with a more progressive agenda than expected must not be thrown out it may be time to downvote the storm of spam and move on but for those who want more discussion of this topic this might help finish it
but he can lose to one that s the problem
uhh that may not have been the best comparison to make
gavin newsom would have mopped the floor with donald i think that 's likely but newsom would not do well in the general election without a significant amount of time to move towards center with how progressive he is there are no viable candidates to replace biden and the polls show that biden has the best chance including ones conducted after the debate
the primaries are over the most harmful thing to joe biden 's chances right now and therefore the best way to support donald trump is the band wagoning against him there is no way that some late replacement picked by party insiders could do better than biden who already beat donald trump once
yes because biden ’s horrible debate performance was n’t the issue it was the nyt pointing out what everyone with eyes and ears saw and heard
has that worked so far
barely still very badly vs every other past dem on a ticket in recent times outside her party difference is marginal between her as well as biden there and she under runs biden enough with white voters that it keeps her below trump outside moe on top of it she ’s still the strongest replacement candidate available right now but 6 6 is a “ we ’re doomed ” territory
that ’ll show em and it will definitely help biden appear younger than he is go get em tiger
no whitmer would cause people of color to defect to 3rd party or abstention more shapiro is a “ who ” and newsom is liable to damage dems more with white college educated women who adore harris it ’s a lousy situation but it ’s reality
if bringing up 2016 helps you cope with 2020 and 2024 then go for it
biden can not win after that debate not only is he already 3 points off where he needs to be it ’s now clear that much of the republican scaremongering was actually right and i only see more gaffes coming from biden it ’s over he has to go the last thing trump wants is a generic dem opponent with no national track record for him to twist and lie about
but he can lose to one that s the problem that was true earlier this year it was even true in 2020
yeah do you know how the laws work i 'll give you a hint only one person was charged because he actually broke laws everyone seems to forget pence was in the exact same situation as biden why does no one bring up pence being above the law maybe because they followed the law
while not giving a shit about all trump 's lies kinda like you
i mean he did win 2020 and has been tied with trump in polls if polls are just a little bit off in biden 's favor he might actually be winning right now it 's very hard to know there are always a few people that are very hard to reach and they probably did n't even watch the debate
democrats that lost the house in 2022 are way too comfortable
then as per the article nobody else can either concede to donald trump and go home let the rest of us deal with 2024 you 're making everything worse
yeah but you need to reassess the likelihood given the impression biden gave he may have 1 2 more chances to make widely seen public impression do you really trust this 81 year old to suddenly look like he ’s 61 again and even then it probably wo n’t be enough the election result is pretty much set now and i ’m sorry but the only way out is to replace him
i care a lot and will vote blue no matter what but i ’m also not burying my head in the sand about biden ’s age and ability to beat trump and lead for four more years i can care about trump ’s lies and biden ’s age simultaneously i ’m sorry objective reality is hard for you to accept better to denounce things you do n’t like than to accept and deal with them huh
there 's a reason a lot of really smart people make for terrible politicians it 's not good enough to be smart the most important part is a social skill being able to inspire people and convince them that you are the right choice with enough charisma even the village idiot can get elected it does n't matter that trump told lies it would n't matter if everything he said was a lie if the person debating him was n't able to convince people that they were lies people firmly in each camp are irrelevant to the debate it 's all about the few million undecided who will determine the election what they saw was biden getting steamrolled by trump it 's what trump does he does n't have to be smart he does n't have to even know what he 's talking about he just has to convince enough of the undecided and or uninformed voters who are n't going to take the time to do a deep dive of the claims made that he does know what he 's talking about in that context he absolutely destroyed biden because again charisma is what wins the day and that 's why the debate absolutely rocked some people 's expectations
the republican nominee wo nt change the rnc has spoken no matter how many more lies he says unless trump dies he is going to be the r candidate nothing can change that its set that discussion is over all the trials pending sentences etc do n't matter anymore trump is the republican candidate republicans will vote for trump talking about trump is like farting in the wind wo nt change anything you can write a million articles and it wo nt change a thing which by the way the so you are as much of a liar as trump so stop complaining about trump because that is n't going to win the election
let me just address that article because is it ’s full of wrong assumptions imo 1 no one else polls as good as biden because they do n’t have the name recognition to beat out the do n’t knows 2 correct but biden 4 years ago was a much better communicator than today 3 he has but it ’s not viewed by the american people that way 4 yes but not under an inflation spike 5 all dem nominees in my lifetime have been phenomenal fundraisers 6 this part is a very valid concern 7 simply not true name recognition will be solved within weeks once they are the democratic nominee 8 unfortunately now it is 9 this one did 10 yes but this years already been about trump and bidens losing of those only the civil war is a valid point to swing the election away from trump i think the dems need to both remove biden and run a very disciplined re selection process
polls from after the debate show biden with an uptick the doom and gloom attitude is extremely premature
the election result is pretty much set now it 's june lol and i ’m sorry but the only way out is to replace him there are no good replacements and there 's not enough time for a new candidate to move to center by the time of the dnc when someone would be selected within a couple months of the election any new candidate that was not campaigning during primaries that is already center enough to replace him now will not do it because it hurts their chances for a 2028 run
better to denounce things you do n’t like than to accept and deal with them huh you 're clearly accepting the reality that biden did n't do well in the debate but how are you dealing with them
i think you 've made wrong assumptions in your analysis of the article i 'll stand by the article and leave others to make up their minds beyond those points history has shown that any party seriously challenging or replacing an incumbent loses the next election 1968 1980 1992 we may believe that joe biden may lose in 2024 doubtful but we can be virtually certain a replacement at this later than ever date will lose if we want to keep donald trump out of power we ought not to be participating in the foolishness of distracting from important issues and dividing donald trump 's opposition as that and the reduced turnout is exactly what the heritage foundation would like donald trump can not win in 2024 without substantial turnout drop off and divided opposition is a good way to make that happen
it ’ll be a week or so before we get accurate polling that includes the debate fallout but let ’s remember that if he ’s down by 2 points then he ’s actually down by 5 he needs to win by about 3 % and in todays polarized world that ’s a disaster
a lot of candidates have lost by june before and i do n’t really understand your second argument you ’re saying more centrist candidates wo n’t run i do think generally that there are risks in a new selection process but i would take these risks any day over the risk of running with biden at this point given what ’s at stake
i mean my first point is essentially undebatable but a lot of the other points are more complex of course i take your point about incumbents being replaced however it ’s a bit more tricky than that because they only tend to be replaced when they are very unpopular so it suggests a difficult environment for the incumbent party the bookmakers currently have biden at only a 20 % chance of winning so i do n’t know how you can tell yourself it ’s doubtful that he loses
and i do n’t really understand your second argument you ’re saying more centrist candidates wo n’t run let 's play this out then who exactly can replace biden that is center enough to retain the center right he 's got already this poll was conducted post debate and no one polled better than him against trump who among those names or even anyone else would do better edit updated with link that has visualizations
giving them both a f agreed trump sucked too if anyone actually bothered to see the whole thing
i 'm an award winning social studies teacher there should n't be debate coaches or debate teams the purpose of a debate is for two sides with honestly conflicting views to steelman each other 's sides and then hash out their differences so people can pick a side honestly what this format and all debate teams are is a sport a stupid sport that stresses snap rebuttals and public speaking skills rather than a search for truth imagine trump was debating stephen hawking about physics i would assume the vast majority of us would agree that hawking knew more about physics than donald trump in this ridiculously absurd format hawking would earn an f because the guy is totally disabled and unable to speak so that 's the not freaking point of a debate cnn 's format incentivizes lying trump says some ridiculous thing then biden has 2 seconds to explain why it 's wrong well it takes way more energy and effort to debunk a lie than to lie so biden looks bad debate is not a sport period in my class if a kid has a gaffe during a debate first they are allowed time to recollect their thoughts and try again second anyone that laughs at them for having a gaffe is thrown out because that 's not what is important
are n’t champion debates a sham at this point only about saying the most arguments as fast as you can
hmm your opinion that you 're a champion debate coach scores an f the substance of what biden said was fine
to save you a read the author of the opinion piece is a college debate coach he thinks both sides get an f but biden gets a slightly lower f
neither one should get another term i ’m tired of rehashing the reasons trump should n’t he just should n’t biden did a great job of taking the wh from trump in 2020 and signed many important bills into law he stood up for us all thank you joe let ’s move on do n’t mention rfk jr he ’s not on the ballot in every state and he ca n’t win the electoral college now what what who how do we save our democracy
talk about maximum cope that debate was like watching mike tyson in his prime punching an infant to death
i ’m also a champion debate coach i give both candidates a 99 100 amazing work by both parties they ’d sweep harvard
he did give trump a b not sure how a b and an f make an f overall when biden got a d and an f to get an f overall
time for biden to step down
totally stephen hawking and trump debate about what to do if your boat with a battery sinks near sharks who wins they most confident literally the con in con man or the lesser articulate truth teller
i should have added text in my post to explain that this is from an article and i am not the author of it
stop this is the first paragraph you did n't read the article editor ’s note todd graham is a professor of debate at southern illinois university his teams have won five national championships he ’s been named the national debate coach of the year three times and been presented with the lifetime achievement award in academia and debate the views expressed in this commentary are his own view more opinion at cnn
the substance of most of what biden said was fine when you are asked about the national debt and your answer is look we beat medicare then your debate substance has failed on that question alone
how were you able to decipher him
get out this is an intervention if you believe what you just wrote your as bad off as those poor souls being mesmerized by trump
why what 's your agenda that s a really poor description here is his teams page you 'll see that they are for about ten years now one of the best colligate debate team in the us
lmao if you cut the debate to just show trumps parts he comes out looking like a raving lunatic who should n’t be running a bath let alone the united states of america
when it was supposed to be a spelling bee
editor ’s note todd graham is a professor of debate at southern illinois university his teams have won five national championships he ’s been named the national debate coach of the year three times and been presented with the lifetime achievement award in academia and debate the views expressed in this commentary are his own view more opinion at cnn first paragraph here 's more info he did in fact beat harvard but i m not sure they are like a big school for that
he gave him trump an f overall just that on presentation to clarify
i think his substance was better than trump ’s but he should ’ve been hitting abortion like a hammer on trump 24 7 for one thing and point out he was the first pres to stand with unions at a picket line as sanders noted imo the debate coach gave a f to trump too beltway is dead wrong on this as usual he sucked too no one won this if you watched more than 20 minutes
the best way is to read the transcript without considering people 's skin tone and vocal tone
biden not only did n't talk about abortion but he rambled on about his worst policy immigration when asked about abortion just shameful that democrats would allow someone with dementia to embarrass themselves should have let him retire in dignity imo trump got a b in this debate
biden it ’s been a terrible thing what you ’ve done the fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported roe when it was decided supported roe and i was that ’s this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous and this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it we ’re in a state where in six weeks you do n’t even know whether you ’re pregnant or not but you can not see a doctor have your and have him decide on what your circumstances are whether you need help the idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying we ’re going to turn civil rights back to the states let each state have a different rule look there ’s so many young women who have been including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral the idea that she was murdered by by by an immigrant coming in and inaudible talk about that but here ’s the deal there ’s a lot of young women who are being raped by their by their in laws by their by their spouses brothers and sisters by just it ’s just it ’s just ridiculous and they can do nothing about it and they try to arrest them when they cross state lines oh you 're right this made things so much more clear it 's basically night and day sometimes i think the read the transcript people are n't actually reading the transcript this says biden was inaudible 3 times this is an incoherent mess
your brain must be bigger than mine biden is barely coherent even when spelled out in a transcript
your whole feed is maga crap
trump ’s presentation was better initially but it quickly got worse and by the end his performance itself was trash too to the author which is more or less my opinion
i did not say biden was articulate i said that compared to trump even when sick and inarticulate he reads like a genius yes he looks up to mediocrity but trump is beyond the pale and a ridiculous bser and bonus biden is not calling to end the constitution like trump has done
biden looks up to mediocrity but compared to trump yea that is a very very low bar biden answered questions instead of bsing its all irrelivant to me only trump has called to end the constitution and i have a policy to vote against any unamerican politicians calling to terminate the constitution
that is n't mediocre it 's bad it makes no sense and again this is n't considering the actual sounds he made or his hour of confused expressions which make it even worse what do you mean end the constitution do you mean abolish it compared to trump biden does not read like a genius this is an insane take
when did trumo call to end the constitution
i said he is looking up to mediocrity compared to trump 's inane bsing he is a genius trump called to end the rule of law including the constitution compared to trump trump did not even try to answer most of the questions and just ranted compared to trump a cartoon is genius as i said it is a very very low bar yeah biden is crap in his own way but filtering out the visuals and tones helps focus on words that is all i am saying
good question on one occassion that i am aware of he said it explicityly also he has talked up the idea of and promoted the image of himself as king and dictator on multiple occasions example his nfts that show him as a king
dude you actually might have lost your mind focusing on the words eliminating most of the evidence pretending i did n't see what i saw biden comes across as extremely unwell based solely on these transcripts compared to trump in the best light biden is clearly unhealthy
seems pretty obvious you 're spinning the context of what he said
if rnc had run anyone other than a felonious insurrectionist they would win in a landslide
did you notice all the hamas supporters are the ones jumping on biden in these comment threads check their comment histories it 's like they only discovered politics when palistinians die but nothing about ukraine xinjiang grozny etc
did 80 million americans watch that one too
it ’s ridiculous if the bar for our candidate is he can read words from a teleprompter we ’re in trouble he absolutely is going to lose and we have the dnc spin machine to blame
i really did n't see why msnbc went straight from the debate to the histrionic reactions joy reid was receiving on her phone is joy reid 's group chat a place i would normally get my news where totally measured and rational discourse happens
“ you can hear it already praise for how fired up and alert joe biden seems when he ’s reading off a teleprompter at a rally in raleigh n c instead of answering questions on a debate stage in atlanta yes that ’s the point in tightly stage managed appearances where biden does n’t have to think on his feet he can competently read words written by other people and every speaker sounds better when applause greets the end of every sentence and if a president ’s lone duty was to read speeches between the hours of 10 a m and 4 p m the country could easily survive another four years of joe biden alas threats disasters and high stakes decisions arrive at times outside the middle of the day as hillary clinton ’s 2008 ad in the democratic primary warned “ it ’s 3 00 a m and your children are safe and asleep but there ’s a phone in the white house and it ’s ringing something ’s happening in the world your vote will decide who answers that call ” biden appeared lost confused and overwhelmed shortly after 9 p m eastern standard time god only knows how he handles any 3 a m phone calls warning him of a developing crisis he probably mumbles “ build another pier ” forget the argument that biden can handle the duties of the presidency over the next four years biden does n’t look or sound like he can handle the duties of the presidency right now but democrats are talking themselves into believing that thursday night was just a bad dream that somehow biden ’s abysmal performance before the cameras for 90 minutes wo n’t have any meaningful effect on the race democratic elected officials have dutifully issued statements that they ’re sticking with biden barack obama himself has thrown cold water on the idea of replacing biden at the convention and mark is right without the public or private support from obama the effort to ditch and replace biden will go nowhere we ’ll see if the impact of the debate is minor or major but it ’s hard to believe that thursday night helped biden in any way his job approval rating was already low americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction and they think that biden is too old to be president biden ’s road to reelection only got harder last night and teleprompter speeches at rallies are n’t going to undo the damage he just had the worst debate performance ever in the immediate aftermath everyone in the democratic party was in a completely justified panic and less than 24 hours later they ’ve decided to double down on the same bet sure the democrats are ruthless underhanded and determined to win at all costs but they ’re also often really stupid the nation ’s emergency rooms are full of americans suffering the effects of political whiplash as the conventional wisdom suddenly and violently shifted back and forth over a matter of hours ”
who really thinks a teleprompter speech assuaged concerns after the debate
you could say the same about the dnc trump is n't a strong candidate someone younger would be running away with this the country is n't clamoring to go back to trump they just do n't trust joe to navigate what is an incredibly taxing job
i hate to break it to you but the evidence is pointing to a trump landslide the latest poll shows trump leading in new jersey new jersey is now a swing state
nice try only 50 million watched the debate down from the last one
cool biden 's poll numbers went up after the debate mostly cause most people watching had n't seen a trump speech in years they were reminded what trump is all about and why he lost the election
exactly unbelievable that the dnc is blaming “ a cold ” and “ stuttering ” what we all of america saw was absolutely alarming trump is a clear and present threat to the united states and the dnc is holding up biden as the bulwark against that it is a nightmare
i have heard many commentaries today regarding the “ strong ” performance of biden at the rally the dnc is delusional it ’s unbelievable that they are white washing the debate performance as the fault of “ a cold ” or “ stuttering ”
the latest poll modern polling is very broken and bad polls are more effectively being used to steer public sentiment than predict outcomes mark my words as soon as the results come in for biden these low value polls will be used as evidence of fraud and the magas will be all over it
which shows one of two things 1 there is something seriously wrong with the polls 2 if nj is really in play then switching candidates right now is pointless because any dem would lose enough swing states to lose overall
finally took a look in the mirror
does the 50 million figure include streaming
how many of these 50 m people would actually consider voting for dems also how many of them were actually in a state that matters and how many of them wo n't care and how many will forget about it once the election is here
i kind of believe the cold story his voice was so different weak strained but it does n't explain all the issues that was happening
biden is one person in a giant administration that he has built with decades of experience 12 in the white house i care far more about that and desperately want the current admin to continue instead of rolling the dice and swapping it out for something that is probably going to be worse this is n't a cult of personality or a one man show like trump and the gop want it to be it 's a giant team effort and we have to look at the big picture
halfish of this sub is going to have reality slap them in the face come november they ’ve scurried back to their echo chambers and are high on copium
or they just shine the light on trump which i think is warranted just after biden is gone
is this the new democratic spin polls are broken dems are in serious trouble they 've had a corpse run this country for 3 years and have openly lied about it by telling us he 's sharp as a tack undecided voters are scared of the democratic party and are running in the opposite direction that 's the fact
yeah if nj is somehow actually in play then trump has just flat out won none of the replacements stand a chance
partisan brain rot democrats always good
the nielson numbers do yes
lol people have the memory of a housefly biden will do a bunch of normal speeches and it 'll be forgotten within a month tops count on it
bro chill with these mental gymnastics
i agree it sounds like he had a cold however as you said that does n’t excuse the inability to counter any of trump ’s outrageous bullshit comments
i did n't think they could be as bad as maga with the delusions but they are just as bad
well if he had a cold they knew about it maybe they actually did give him drugs for it and it might have had some negative effect on him that could explain some of the rest he is old even smaller changes to his energy could have an impact in a stressful situation like a debate my biggest problem with the debate was that he was trying to speak so fast that he just mumbled and did n't finish the words he was trying to say and add the stutter on top of that and then the weak voice i think he 's brain was slower than normally perhaps because of the cold and or medicine for it and his brain just could n't keep up with his mouth lol
even if he did n't have a cold attempting to list off every fact in his head about his presidential accomplishes was just a wash of unintelligible information the cold certainly did n't help
a republican senator attacks biden why is this news
the gop can piss off
trump spewing such a constant onslaught of lies engulfs the opponent it 's like a swarm of drones which one to swat at first cnn provided the platform for it without fact checking
this is getting absurd i 'm sure tom tillis and his band of maga rough riders would love for biden to be removed from office for literally any reason but for a shaky debate performance gtfo
unlike trump 's cabinet i have no doubt that if biden 's cabinet had concerns they 'd enact the 25th amendment
who do we contact about the convicted felon running for president how is that legal ok
if a republican wants it then i guess biden is still the best option to beat trump
a game of “ turnabout is fair play ” silly man political games
every discussion on this forum is the exact same “ biden did terribly ” “ yeah but donald trump lied a ton so he should ’ve lost the debate ” repeated over and over yes trump lied a ton yes in a better world people would care more about substance than delivery and all that lying would disqualify someone from being a serious candidate but we live in the real world in the real world delivery and appearance are more important than message you can whine and complain that it should n’t be that way but it is so it ’s time to move beyond complaining and just select someone who can also deliver their message well
biden ’s strategy was bad he should have just said “ those are all lies i yield my time back to the liar over there so he can say more lies ” every time god damn his people failed to prepare him
biden should be competent enough to refute the lies but he was n’t and now here we are
do n’t blame the platform for biden ’s dementia he is literally the leader of the most important country in the world and the bar is so low we ca n’t hold him accountable to standing up to a reality show star jesus christ this is the american presidency and y’ all want hand holding for everything
optics is at least 50 % of the message
dude he 's sick not a cold like he 's actually falling apart plus i 'm fairly sure the counter is no it 's your turn to speak so speak and then we 'd be left with incoherent word salad again biden is not well
stop making excuses for donald trump 's incessant lies have you been doing that for the whole month now
tell me you did n't watch rally the next day in raleigh without telling me you did n't watch the rally in raleigh the next day
look it 's whataboutism that 's what you guys are doing yeah joe biden belongs in a dementia ward but trump lies you 're deflecting from the obvious i 'm not a trump guy i 'm a dem have been since i could vote but i 'm not blinded by party loyalty i think we should be willing to have the discussion about bidens fitness for office you guys would rather elect someone with mush for brains than to criticize validly
who did and why would i
the incumbent who won the primaries twice and has been doing a good job in office will continue to do so despite quietly talking policy on stage and at times being overwhelmed by donald trump 's incessant lies to the point of frustration there is an election coming up with two candidates comparing one to the other is not whataboutism it is rational decision making
trump is not qualified for a million reasons of course that 's a nonstarter let 's set that aside that debate was a disaster biden is obviously not mentally fit to hold office we need a better more viable candidate and we need them now i 'm voting against trump regardless but i do not want biden to be the president i want someone younger someone who is both physically and mentally capable of handling the stresses of the job
do you really think he 's the one doing the job he cleared his schedule and spent a week to prepare for that debate and he could n't even keep track of his own thoughts but at least he defeated medicare
joe biden is literally in power right now and doing a better job than many expected you may or may not vote against donald trump but you are definitely part of the hysteria working to discourage turnout and get donald back into power whether you intend so or not because 2024 will be decided upon turnout biden is not going anywhere more
the job is being done under his authority and we have seen him doing it well since 2021 so spare us the absurdity the debate is practically meaningless and this focus on one debate as if it changes everything is hysterical just like all the focus on ' hillary 's emails ' in 2016
this is no hysteria you are ignoring the evidence of your eyes and ears you can hand wave all you want it 's not going to work jon stewart warned about this months ago biden is 82 he is n't getting better this is a one way trip he 's has his four years step aside and make way for a better candidate who will be a better president someone who has a chance to defeat trump
dude that debate is the absurdity here you ca n't have a president who ca n't finish a sentence or keep track of his own thoughts it 's absolutely batshit crazy he is loosing to a convicted criminal where i 'm at he would be legally barred from many types of jobs he would loose his drivers licence in a heartbeat it 's completely insane and unethical to make him the most powerful person in the world nevermind the elder abuse this is you should read the reactions from foreign diplomats to get some perspective on how the world sees this
nonsense joe biden got better that very night after the debate and was quite lucid the next day and btw he 's 81 oops read the article here 's a portion it is not possible to gain name recognition trust and public respect over just a few weeks the summer before an election and gop politicos certainly understand this even if democrats do not and this normal operation of u s politics is exacerbated to democrats ’ detriment by the fact that trump has a highly motivated even fanatical cult following that will definitely turn out to vote if democrats had a superstar with that sort of appeal they ’d already have made themselves known
that s how out of touch this sub is and i suggest you to read it as a comedy from now on that being said after the debate the only feeling i have is pity pity for biden that he should be retiring enjoying life instead he has to be pushed out to run for dem because in that party no one is agreeing with no one
you know how the trump cultists are blind to his many many glaringly obvious faults that 's you right now
yes it is the overturning of chevron deference is going to gridlock the courts for decades of course for these psychopaths that 's the point justice delayed is justice denied
this is like saying water is n't wet grass is n't green no it 's as radical as it could be given the current political climate and it 'll cut off idaho abortion rights in that case the second trump gets re elected if he is permanently for instance kavanaugh said he would n't help overturn roe if given a seat on scotus but did it nonetheless and was going to
they legalized bribery they allowed pollution of our beautiful waters and air they decided that women are second class citizens the supreme court are devils
all i 'm saying is that if i made 4 million from gifts that i failed to report to the irs i would n't have a job
allowing cities to ban homelessness nope not radical yet on the statue of liberty give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these the homeless tempest tossed to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door
you mean they ca n’t do a kick flip on a skateboard what ’s their opinion on pizza
reddit 's algorithm is so cooked why is this being shown to anyone when it is getting nothing but downvotes or is this part of the foreign influence campaign like seriously we deserve answers on why r politics is constantly littered with this bullshit
it is more corrupt arrogant corrupt incompetent corrupt political corrupt inept corrupt political and corrupt though
it 's far more than i thought it ever could be thinking judges know more than doctors and scientists in their field or study is absolutely insane the supreme court is going to actually kill off the united states
overturning roe was radical add to that the endless delay in the immunity decision and the rampant and blatant corruption of the maga 6 and you have a radical court no matter how you want to sugar coat it
because reason is a libertarian rag they 'll support any deregulation of anything
“ biden ’s performance was n’t as bad as you thought it was ” just change this to r gaslighting at this point i ’m done
they ’re correct most rulings do n’t come down to 6 3 on party lines
reading chevron it just sounds like legislators have to write better law that does n't make it up the chain of courts
he lied to congress so did barrett both should be impeached and removed on that basis
more than half of the house is the same
gratuity it 's no longer a bribe gift
you do n’t report gifts you receive to the irs that ’s not a thing
cities have been effectively doing this for decades though this is n’t some new policy just furthering previous ones every anti loitering law every time they remove benches or make it impossible to sleep on it ’s always been trying to criminalize homelessness
why are you quoting the statue of liberty while discussing legalities one has nothing to do with the other
your answer here is part of the problem this is a political sub which goes both ways you ’re just expecting to only see things from the side you agree with and if that ’s the case just go to r democrats or something
in other words the republican party
it was terrible but the funny thing is the vibes that reached uninterested voters for months prior to the debate were that biden was feeble we visitors to a politics subreddit had much higher expectations of biden than the politically apathetic potential voters it still sucked bad but was not perceived quite as badly from the sidelines
this thinking is the problem they are supposed to be an apolitical bench there should be no party lines within the supreme court
most ruling are n’t on political cases you can bet they will help republicans every time they can even taking the trump immunity case is disgusting and intended to simply delay
gift tax is a thing covers anything over 15 000 with that being said his issue is technically that he has to disclose things of value publicly and did n't so yeah technical inaccuracy on my part point stands
the quote on the statue is supposed to speak to our ideals and when our laws and our ideals differ that should be seen as a problem this highlights that stop being obtuse
no but i do come here to see articles that the users of this subreddit have agreed with and upvoted not universally panned and downvoted to oblivion that 's how reddit is supposed to work
this is a political sub this is a popularity contest aggregator website when shit gets upvoted it 's supposed to gain visiblity the inverse is happening logically the site should be a giant echo chamber for better or worse and yet here we are with immensely unpopular shit sitting on the front page again you may like or dislike that but something not visible to users is determining the presentation of content rather than what one would expect
you make a very good point i ca n't tell if it makes me feel better or not
why do n’t i hear the media complain about the 3 liberal justices voting in a block
gift tax applies to the giver though not the recipient
i 'm not being obtuse if you 're going to quote a poem that has fuck and all to do with the law you might as well start quoting the quran and bible as well
yeah i was technically imprecise with my speech there it is n't a thing that you have to report most gifts as the receiver unless they are given from less than a detached and disinterested generosity
then “ nope do n’t give us your homeless however give us your wealthy ” better
nope and i do n't why you think it would be
author tries really hard to sound insightful about the usa but um what
trump is a populist the dems need a plan b or we are going to get a neo christo fascist project 2025 abortion ban hellscape
convicted felon rapist conman and failed president who is a pathological liar pass
turns out people “ like ” a candidate that can form a coherent thought and speak in actual sentences who would have thought
it was n't a debate about substance because the other guy was completely incoherent and not there
plan b spend time mentioning the good things that have happened in the past three years policy proposals for the future the terrible things the republican majority supreme court has done the misdeeds of donald trump and project 2025 not ' biden needs to drop out ' nonsense
beautiful company beautiful guy ’s been doing it for 50 years sells hundreds of boats they use mercury engines they want to take that out they want to make it all electric i asked “ how is it ” he said it ’s a problem sir they want us to make all electric boats the problem is the boat is so heavy it ca n’t float ’ i said that sounds like a problem ’ he said also it ca n’t go fast because of the weight and they want to now have a 50 mile or 70 mile radius you have to go out 70 miles before you can really start the boat up and you go out at two knots that ’s essentially almost like two miles an hour ’ i said how long does it take you to get out there ’ he said many hours and then you ’re allowed to go around for ten minutes and then you have to come back because the battery only lasts a very short period of time ’ so i said let me ask you a question ’ and he said ' nobody has ever asked this question ’ and it must because of mit my relationship to mit very smart ’ he goes i say what would happen if the boat sank from its weight and you ’re in the boat and you have this tremendously powerful battery and the battery ’s now under water and there ’s a shark that ’s approximately 10 yards over there by the way a lot of shark attacks lately do you notice that lotta shark attacks i watched some guys justifying it today well they were n’t really that angry they bit off the young lady ’s leg because of the fact that they were they were not hungry but they misunderstood who she was ’ these people are crazy ’ he said there ’s no problem with sharks they just did n’t really understand a young woman swimming ’ no really got decimated and other people too a lot of shark attacks so i said there ’s a shark 10 yards away from the boat 10 yards or here do i get electrocuted if the boat is sinking water goes over the battery the boat is sinking do i stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted or do i jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted ’ because i will tell you he did n’t know the answer he said you know nobody ’s ever asked me that question ’ i said i think it ’s a good question i think there ’s a lot of electric current coming through that water ’ but you know what i ’d do if there was a shark or you get electrocuted i ’ll take electrocution every single time i ’m not getting near the shark so we ’re going to end that we ’re going to end it for boats we ’re going to end it for trucks yes really coherent thoughts and speaking like every 5 year old would after some candy and cola
for your next trick explain why any of that makes a difference when the guy you 're simping for lies like it 's a bodily function complete sentences do n't really amount to much when it 's all delusional horse shit from a man who is quite literally incapable of telling the truth
ah yes many is the time i often wonder how i would fair on a boat with sharks and batteries or how the revolutionary war was fought at our airports you maga cult are strange ducks at least we know biden 's faults you all think trump looks as strong as rocky is rich and coherent
he does n't have to make sense he just need to deliver with confidence and energy and create an emotional connection with the audience that s why he 's popular biden is the opposite if they do n't replace him trump will win
they both told lies and made stuff up during the debate i ’m not a republican i ’m an independent and i ’m not some sort of trump super fan you really think biden is the right person to be the leader and commander in chief of the most power country in the world i would n’t trust him to live by himself without a life alert button what the democratic party is doing right now pretending he is ok is disgraceful he had a cold please we are n’t blind
he just need to deliver with confidence and energy so that is exactly how con artists work
they both told lies and made stuff up during the debate lmao yeah sure
only person that mentioned biden is you soooo yeah just because i criticized ttump and rightly pointed out that he 's a pathological liar which he is does not equate to me automatically thinking biden is a good choice trump sure as hell is no better tho and would be infintely more destructive to this country than biden complete sentences or not if you prefer to waste your vote on a diaper wearing nazi who is detached from reality that 's on you
i know this from many years of pondering why anyone would vote for trump in my opinion what happened last night completely ruined bidens candidacy optics is the only thing that matters he has to be replaced
that 's exactly what trump is but it works
maybe for you but there 's a lot more than optics going on for many the sky is falling is already getting old speaking of old the old people in this country the ones that always vote many did n't see the debate anything like you did
i agree substance does n’t matter debate was about optics biden looked really bad
reddit was pretty well flooded with nonsense about hillary clinton in 2016 and then donald trump got into power today reddit is all flooded out with arguing over whether the current incumbent and winner of the primaries should drop out and hand the nomination to someone picked by party insiders instead we ought to learn from the past
the world also see that your man trump is a liar thief cheater rapist and con man there are literally videos of world leaders laughing at him and avoiding personal contact because he 's such an awful person but wsj never mentions that because you make no pretense of being fair or balanced in your reporting just another russia owned disinformation outlet out to sway american public opinion to make russia great again wsj is unfit for the bottom of a bird cage
i saw an honest man showing signs of advanced age vs a self serving liar
do n’t care still voting dem all the way down the ballot
i always find it odd that trump has been having his brain melt since 2019 also tried to overthrow an election and overthrow our government but the real problem is a single debate by biden
wsj not really unbiased here
that north carolina campaign speech kinda proves this wrong i recommend watching it also wsj is a murdoch rag
one of the problems here is that there are several types of dementia but most americans are only familiar with the ca n't recall names unsure about where you are symptoms trump 's forward pitched posture trouble with ramps need to help guide a cup to his mouth with the other hand hygiene issues incontinence and use of adult diapers inability to smoothly speak certain words mixing up the names of people etc are apparently all signs of frontotemporal dementia that groups of sharp eyed psychiatrists and psychologists have noticed with him and written about since 2017
we also saw trump deteriorating and republicans ignored the warnings where s the article about that
biden literally beat trump by millions of votes before people forget the only reason why it was a nail biter of a race is because of the bullshit of the electoral college ooh the guy had a bad debate in a format where he 's expected to rebut a bunch of lies in 2 seconds here you try it the correct psi for a toyota prius is 5 can you rebut this false fact immediately on national tv i bet you ca n't even if you driven a prius i drive a prius and inflate my own tires regularly and i ca n't do it it takes way more energy to rebut a lie than to lie
so let me get this straight the maga cult ignores the lying cheating convicted felon rapist and the democrats are the ones who do n't see the warning signs
lol he gave a rousing speech right after the debates biden got gish galloped that 's all bad night bad format
if you want a taste of reality look at his speeches for the past 3 months was the debate an anomaly you 'll find out that 's called critical thinking folks all the wanking done on here is worthless in the face of just finding out what 's actually going on that said i think he should step down because i have no faith in people 's ability to think critically he 's toast whether deserves to be or not
they did n't just ignore it they lied and attempted to gaslight everyone about what they were seeing cooking up ridiculous claims about cheap fakes and so on
all this anti biden propaganda is laughable y'all have the morals of alley cats republicans ignored the warnings that trump is a life long grifter convicted of 34 felony charges and found liable for sexual assault
he ’s got ta drop out now that debate performance was a disaster trump just got a huge shot in the arm
ignored also are ignoring and will continue to ignore
just put hillary back on the ticket
it ’s not praising trump to say that biden ’s performance was abysmal i ’m so sick of this narrative biden looked horrible i ’d vote for a moldy bag of grapes over donald trump and i ’m sure a lot of others will too but it is not praising trump to say we want a better candidate we should n’t just be voting against trump we should be voting for a candidate we truly believe in no one watched that debate and thought that joe biden is the man for the job
“ your guy sucks worse than our guy ” is not a defense against your guy also not being qualified there is a minimum bar and the dnc failed us we expect the gop to be self serving awful liars that ’s their brand the democrats are self deluded prowler grabbers that do n’t know when to step aside because they live in a “ my turn ” culture
laughing at him like when he told europe to get off russian gas or to pay 2 percent for defense measures
you are mixing morality with ability to do the job biden has morality but increasing showing that he may not have the ability to do the job trump has no morality but has the ability to perform the job so is your definition of elections a morality contest or ability to actually work most ppl definition is the later and that is why wsj is not mentioning about trump ’s morality it ’s not relevant when the discussion is about whether you can do the job
what are you talking about everyone 's laughing at biden he 's turned america into a joke and the world is spiraling into war
not a single word about advisers sure it boils down to a single person ’s decision but it ’s also based on information from advisers who research a specific aspect in relation to that decision three of trump ’s family ’s were advisers and if that is n’t a rubber stamp
neither one is who should be in the white house for the next term
we all saw the debate it was horrible he was reading a teleprompter at the rally
biden literally beat trump by millions of votes before and will again it 's bananas that we have to talk about how close this race is when we know trump will lose the popular vote by millions for the third time the electoral college has failed in its purpose and should be abolished
you are comparing making speeches by reading off a tele prompter against a live debate where were the live interviews of substantial length in the last few months that we can compare with it was n't stammering and poor oratory that people saw it was his confusion inability to finish a sentence and losing the trains of thoughts that many americans have seen in their own family
probably yeah and him dropping out sooner rather than later would be better for his legacy too whitmer would be a good replacement but she 's going to need time to build up national brand recognition
putting the only person to lose to trump at the top of the ticket is literally the dumbest possible option
february ' 25 putin invades georgia estonia poland who in their right mind would want either trump or thursday 's biden in charge of the west 's reponse
do you want to vote do you want your vote to count then you 're down to 2 bad choices feeble capable and ethical vs vigorous unethical and incapable mark cuban
this was the 2020 election talking point too biden has had a fine presidency when are you going to learn the presidents power is the people they choose to do the job they are a figurehead it 's why trump was able to watch fox and friends and eat hamburgers non stop for 4 years
the smelly rapist already demonstrated during his first term that he has no ability to do the job
trump has the ability to do the job wtf trump at the best of times behaves like a petulant 6 year old neither of them are remotely fit for office a rock is a better choice than trump because it will do less damage
the leader of the us must demonstrate moral character everyday and ethical behavior on the global stage trump is a parochial convict and global laughingstock the momentum competency and success of team biden clearly demonstrates the total lack of us progress during trump 's administration he surrounded himself by losers and it showed four lost years mark cuban summed it up do you want feeble capable and ethical or vigorous unethical and incapable
any day of the week i 'll take the aging guy over the narcissist compulsive liar who is aspiring to be an autocrat i will 100 % be voting for biden edited to fix typo
i ’m old fashioned instead of fantasizing about perfection i ’ll support honesty and a solid record of accomplishment over lies and incompetence every time
that ’s what vice presidents are for apparently the only way we get power away from boomers is literally from their dead hands
so one bad performance and he 's damned for life yeah go doom somewhere else
again bad day vs bad condition does he say anything off the cuff in recent speeches or pressers could he do a speech if he was that badly off i do n't know the answer but yours is the usual knee jerk response
i want the fucking guy and party that is not totally compromised by putin is this a serious fucking question
probably not the one who is complicit and was working to give to putin everything he wanted by attempting to weaken and shut down nato meanwhile blocking congressionally appropriated aide to ukraine and attempting to trap zelensky in a quid pro quo arrangement where he would announce a fraudulent investigation into hunter biden yeah they 'd probably want the guy who is an actual fucking president and not the one at the heels of vlad like an obedient lap dog
mark cuban would be an embarrassment of a candidate but at least he ’s able to think on his feet without a teleprompter and does n’t currently have a borderline abysmal approval rating
well election is about what america citizens think and wants not what you alone think i know you like to think that only your vote n view matters but unfortunately in a democracy the majority decides
but let ’s say he wins that means majority of americans have decided that moral character is not the main concern right
same but that does n’t change my opinion that he should step aside
lmao fantasizing about perfection we literally want a democratic nominee who does n't have dementia that is not fantasizing about perfection when biden loses in november people like you will be to blame
his abysmal public approval rating does n’t exactly speak to his accomplishments tbh lol
dude he ’s going to get trump elected that ’s not doom it ’s the truth
does he say anything off the cuff in recent speeches or pressers a sentence or two yeah a full on interview almost never why do you think he was kept away he is still being kept away from journalists could he do a speech if he was that badly off dementia still can do certain things he already had some gaffs just not nearly as serious we have just been gaslighted to believe it is normal for him you can have a nice conversation with a dementia patient and not noticed anything unusual while they actually have no idea who you are and where they were we have seen seasoned politicians having a bad day on the podium sweaty forehead nervous hand gestures lost of words saying things that do n't make sense but biden was clearly confused and lost the sentence midway he was on democrats can swept this away and pin this on hope that it wo n't happen again or do something while there is still time but the window is closing so fast i do n't have much hope this wo n't be total derailment by mid september
right lol i very much do not want the guy that shared multiple times the intimate talks he had with putin during the debate that was one of my takeaways watching the whole thing
putin told me he was going to invade ukraine before he did cool why are n't we talking about that coupled with trump 's response to hold ukraine 's military funds it should be a huge post debate talking point instead we want to talk about how the old guy with a lifelong stutter lost his way in a question and had a hoarse voice insane
i despise trump with the fire of a thousand suns and made it clear he 'd be a nightmare in the scenario i presented take a few deep breaths clear your mind once more then you 'd want the biden on display on thursday dealing with a russian invasion of poland
we can kiss our democracy goodbye if the smelly rapist is allowed to return to power and clearly the majority of the country does n’t want him since he always loses by several million votes
but unfortunately in a democracy the majority decides if only that were true but thanks to the electoral college presidents can be elected without winning a majority of actual votes it ’s how the orange shitstain who is abjectly incapable of doing the job got into office
i would posit that trump 's lack of moral character was the biggest factor in his 2020 loss where any other incumbent would 've coasted into a victory he managed to lose it 's not 2016 anymore the american people know who trump is and while his cult loves him for all of his horribleness average americans are sick of it and would still rather have a guy a couple years older and slower who at least has morals and cares about people and does n't call our country a shit hole
i will say it in every thread because someone has to trump had a much worse night than biden it ’s not an advantage to be allowed to lie unchecked when your lies make you sound like hitler he directly insulted blacks and latinos he bragged about overturning roe his policy positions were uniformly poison and he skipped questions repeatedly to rant about immigrants like a nutcase white liberals and the media are running around screaming with their hair on fire i ’m sure maga loved it everyone else looked at trump and recoiled in horror some people actually watch debates to find out the candidates ’ policy positions weird i know
when biden loses in november people like you will be to blame nope the folks to blame will be those who voted for the narcissist compulsive liar who is aspiring to be an autocrat
i ’ll blame people who did n’t vote for biden because you know they ’re the ones who actually did n’t help
the only one who will get trump elected is people who wo n’t vote blue look at the maga nuts this would n’t phase them at all let ’s not go all “ bernie bros ” here and throw away democracy because he had one bad night
your opinion not mine please doom somewhere else
the biden on display was n't a horrific unmitigated disaster as so many people and so much of the media is desperate to portray him as to the majority of americans that did n't watch and probably never will so absolutely and i am extremely confident that the majorities in those countries in the line of fire would say the same
what are you saying it 's a binary choice either trump or biden and i choose biden if i get to choose eisenhower or roosevelt in their prime then maybe but what third choice are you hinting at
i ’m sure his voters are saying the same thing about biden winning being the end of democracy so who ’s right when both sing the same tune and both set of voters think they are right and that is why everyone has only 1 vote the same as everyone else
i think you are being very simplistic with regard to how people think when they vote morality plays a part but it means absolutely nothing to a guy who had money in the bank during trump and is now struggling to pay bills now do you think he ’s going to vote for morals or based on under who he had a better life there is a big majority who only care about how life is for them personally
sure but the idiots who refused to change direction while heading straight for a cliff also share some blame
it 's not dooming if there 's an alternative if your car is headed for a cliff it 's not dooming to say we 're gon na die turn the fucking car
except it ’s actually true in the case of the smelly rapist he had said as much he refused to leave peacefully last time encourages a coup attempt and has said out loud multiple times he will be a dictator and should be president for life reality will always trump the delusions of the maga cult
you ’re just a little chaos agent bot
hitler could do the job stop making this stupid argument that morality does n’t matter
democrats want to lead step the fuck up what 's more important biden 's pride and feelings or the country if democratic leaders who are the only ones who have the ability to fix this refuse to do their duty here they deserve to lose note of course i 'll be voting democrat no matter what but guess what a lot of people are going to be staying on the couch if biden is the nominee
well if this court said it then it was actually that prosecutors understepped
trump 's judges are being loyal to trump and his trash traitor fans who would have thought
and then they appointed themselves the regulators for all federal agencies we are in big doo doo
i think the ruling only affects about 15 prisoners those charged with obstruction only
i heard and the ramifications will reverberate to trumps other cases
noted trump loyalist kbj lmao just listen to yourself speak man
so that explains why ketanji brown jackson voted with the majority she did n’t really seem like maga to me or why barrett dissented this does n’t seem like a traditional political alignment on this case
soft paywall my ass here 's a link to circumvent the paywall
reticent to write this coming from the land that gave us boris johnson but here goes really america is this the best you can do
i understand the loyalty people want to show but we ca n't keep pretending this is going to work out it is n't joe is not benjamin button and maybe he makes it to november ok but there is n't anyone on this planet that saw that man and thinks he can be president for 4 years it is horrifying that we are willing to hand trump the presidency ruin our democracy because nobody has the stones to admit biden is too old to compete with him and for sure too old to serve 4 years someone needs to act this is not going to end well
we need obama to talk joe into stepping aside biden is unelectable after last night sucks
despite being a bit slow biden gave correct and concise answers to debate questions while trump babbled lied and dodged every important question asked of him palestinian state climate change inequality etc because his policies are for sale to the rich on everything important that said asking whether biden is up for 4 more years of a stressful demanding job at his age is a legitimate concern developing contingency fallback plans to replace biden is not impossible replacing biden is not impossible there are already ' uncommitted ' delegates due to the large number of protest votes over the war in gaza in the democratic primary ' uncommitted ' won second place after biden and uncommitted delegates are not pledged to vote for him uncommitted delegates awarded to protest the war in gaza can nominate someone who would be better for us policy regarding israel palestine based on existing public statements such as chris van hollen then biden can release his delegates once he is convinced there is a competent backup candidate lined up with strong knowledge of foreign policy and other concerning issues then his delegates can vote for the replacement candidate as well so us progressives and uncommitted delegates awarded to protest the war in gaza can put forward a plan b candidate that will improve us policy regarding israel palestine which centrists moderates can get behind as well
i 'm ready for the announcement in a few weeks that biden his halting his campaign due to unforseen health concerns and the dnc announce whitmer will replace him this means biden does n't look bad democrats get a great pick for president and most importantly trump is fucked
legit question when was the last time he was challenged in a public forum put on the spot challenged pressers do n't really count anyone who gets in those rooms are vetted for all kinds of conformity issues
lol it ’s like people forgot trump is a rapist convicted felon and attacked our nation it does n’t matter if it ’s biden or they replace biden at the next debate with a cat licking it ’s itchy asshole you ’d have to be a complete piece of shit to support trump in any way shape or form
he 's been like this for two years whenever he ca n't stick to a strict script it 's a mess how are people just now shocked by how bad he looked at the debate
this debate shows how embarrassing our candidates are and one of these fools will be voted into office truly shows the ignorance of the american public
nato and ukraine should be very very afraid of what is going to happen in the next 4 years thanks joe
obligatory plug for my new sub r hypotheticalpresident two members and growing we got ta find someone and sadly patrick stewart is british
there is n’t enough popcorn for reddit today and last night
this is the text i got from trumplandia from trump i love cnn they gave me the opportunity to wipe the floor with joe biden how 'd i do stop to opt out
afraid of what trump ran around lying and making up disjointed stories for years none of his supporters cared much biden mostly made sense landed a zinger or two ally cat and never does all that great at debates anyway if trump did nt lose much support doing that i do nt know why biden will i get that allies and americans alike do n’t want any chance of a dictator thief in chief in charge here but if the fraudlord felon always gets a pass i do nt see why good faith joe with a competent veep ca nt
i do n’t get how people are that surprised speaking has not been biden a strength honestly he ’s just not nearly as crazy as trump
folks in europe should be scared but remember republicans are allies to russia and n korea controlling 3 states that would be great for landing troops alaska texas and florida so americans should also be scared maybe biden is the democratic party 's reagan is joe governing now how much governing did reagan do i love joe but for me and most likely many others he was the in between president to get the traitor 's mess cleaned up wow what a failure jaime harison should have been fired on 11 9 22 for not being able to beat into the ground a party that attacked the usa in an act of war i know many here blame pugs but dems are just as guilty instead of strengthening democracy the dems have allowed a full on assault to our democracy in the public view project 2025 and have done nothing except spending for donors and appeasement to the base to get back rights the dems let be taken away we are on the verge of wwiii and one presidential candidate most likely set this up and the other just showed the world he may not be able to handle it and may not be driving the bus call your democratic reps and senators offices and ask how are the democrats going to defeat project 2025 and the money behind it put your seat belt on am i the only one sick of voting for democratic candidates because i know the pugs will burn the place down but the dems always to allow another part of our democracy to burn what 's the plan
hot take this is why the debate was so early no one will remember this in a few months then there will be a 2nd debate closer to the election which undecided voters will use and not this one
biden was sick have y all never been sick before i could barely get out of bed or think when i have the cold personally i think biden team should have postpone the debate but they forced biden to debate yesterday so if there 's anyone to blame its them biden himself was impressive given the handicap while trump rambles with incoherent lies
at least uk were able to fire boris johnson and also his replacement when they were acting too erratic while trump got away with 2 impeachments theft of the most sensitive gov secrets a coup attempt and plausibly rampant corruption during his kleptocratic reign
boris was a corrupt embarrassment who dug in his heels for too long before finally giving up however he could at least string a sentence together and was n’t completely incompetent on every issue he was great on responding to ukraine for example not to mention that boris got the boot because of the backlash to his antics and the tories are about to have a truly terrible year come july 4th trump and biden are absolute tragedies in comparison
the dnc runs who they wanna run it 's an invite only club citizens do n't have a choice also we are overworked underpaid and lazy
it never would have come to this if we 'd admitted a year ago that the emperor had no clothes they taught us about propaganda and peer pressure in school but to see it at a national level has just been wild
that someone is barack obama time to talk his friend down from the ledge
rank and file democrats have been asking for a replacement for a while we elected biden in 2020 as an emergency “ get rid of trump “ button we ’ve had four years to search and pick a replacement for the future enough of old people entrenched in power we are for that it ’s the damn politicians yes dem politicians that have failed us and decided to get in bed with gramps
newsflash no one will act they never do everyone is waiting for the next guy who never comes to do something about it
i heard one liberal commentator say “ it seems like the universe wants trump to be president ” it just seems like dems ca n’t catch a break and everything just seems to break trumps way nothing has ever worked at breaking the spell he has on the republican party and his base
trump is only 3 years younger and did n't offer anything last night calm down
that ’s what vice presidents are for and sadly the only way society is going to wrench power from the boomers out of their cold dead hands
modern televised presidential debates have never been about policy they are about projecting an image and detracting from your opponents image nixon lost to jfk because he showed up to their first debate unshaven and was sweating all over the stage meanwhile jfk showed up with tv makeup and a youthful appearance does anyone remember what either one of them said nope that debate is remembered for nixon 's poor appearance
it 's mind boggling how the masses are just now seeing this
nobody is landing troops on the mainland lol
there ’s no plan it ’s allowed to happen because it ’s what the 1 % want
there wo n't be a second debate there 's no benefit to trump all he has to do is run ads showing everyone what we saw last night and it 's a wrap
the optimistic theory is that the debate was scheduled early so that the dems could figure out a replacement soon if biden bombed badly articles like he 's not dropping out does n't help inspire confidence though then again they 'd still probably say that even if they are planning to replace him the whole x coach has the full support of management kiss of death thing maybe
did they mention his illness before the debate
lmao you can not actually believe what you just wrote
so sick he went to waffle house for a meet and greet after the debate
and maybe we should n’t be electing people so old that a cold turns them into a zombie from the walking dead
he 's looked like this for two years i 'm not sure why anyone is surprised
it ’s insane i ’m watching biden live on tv right now speaking in raleigh and he sounds so much better than last night he sounds impassioned strong and coherent where the hell was all this 16 hours ago
pelosi schumer bernie we need an intervention and it has to happen fast we also do n't need alot of fighting and hurt feelings we need to rally around whoever we can i have preferences mainly tied to who i think could win but whoever it is i 'm voting for them and i m not questioning anything i can vote for who i like in 2028 this is no time for infighting we need to get this done
so far nobody has the courage to step up give it the weekend and time for some pollsters to get info into the hands of decision makers in the dnc realistically you ca n't expect the sitting president to stop his campaign in a mere 12 hours if things are going to happen i would think we would hear rumors early next week
dean phillips tried and was labelled a maga psy op
25th amendment if you have to something has to happen it is clearly appropriate to invoke the 25th the cabinet can act kamala ran for president if she considers herself a leader nows the time to lead
i think billions of dollars of money flowing around from oligarchs is giving his “ luck ” a boost
he offered up a slew of lies and hate and all anyone saw was biden ca n’t do 4 years we are n’t going to overcome bidens age he ca n’t do 4 more years not one person i have asked on reddit will say out loud that they think biden can be president for another 4 years someone said well he has staff man that does n’t work do you after seeing him think he is ready to go for 4 more years
people said there would n't be this debate pretty sure they already signed off on the 2nd debate in september
bad theory you throw in fresh meat to trump the r voters biden appeals to now are conflicted if the new person has radical views compared to biden trump could just find the worst dirt on them and use it as amo the list goes on you replace biden with someone new so close to the election it 's a gaurenteed loss why do i say it is a bad theory we would n't have this discussion if biden came out like the state of the union address a few months ago he will learn from this one and adjust for the next one
they should play it like he 's sick check him into walter reed and then say that he 's too ill to go on
they have no reason to stop biden trump lied and did n't offer new voters anything biden explained his policies and the future sure did biden suck yes but trump certainly did n't convince people last night he can suddenly make ameria great again when he already failed once
our leaders are cowards kamala is n’t going to do anything
i 'm telling you trump will gladly back out
i mean i agree if they were to replace him it should have been way sooner but look at the polls and they 're very close with trump even having a slight edge in many trump may be popular amongst some but he 's not that popular it 's hard not to think any halfway competent dem candidate would be leading in all polls now biden 's electability is an issue and has been for months now the one thing i grant you and it is still a big one is that biden has that known quantity aspect of him and in the us that seems to matter a lot but i really think it 's going to get worse from here on out until november for biden
he just held a rally in north carolina that i watched a live feed of he was like a completely different candidate collected cogent focused passionate high energy i do n't think they can push the illness narrative or plan to
nobody thinks biden can go 4 more years nobody biden told the truth trump lied trump won that debate because biden clearly can not be president for 4 more years
i agree he will gladly back out i also feel like this debate did n't help him either so i guess we will see biden camp can also make ads about this and there is 3 months of both of them making speeches and appearances until the next debate so who knows what 's gon na happen
my issue with polls is the sample trying to figure out how the millions of people will vote also there are a lot of people that do n't remember how crazy trump was as president because it has been 4 years and the attention spans are in the present which is why the debate in september will be the main one it could get worse or it could get better imo he was going to have a rough trying to debate someone on policy when the other person does n't debate the questions and only lies or brings up other topics example q view on jan 6 a immigration q view on climate change in american a i made other countries pay their fair share it was a shitshow all around but back to the main theory no way they would use this debate 5 months away from the election to decide if they should use a new candidate
he gave a speech immediately after the debate and looked fine i have no idea what happened during the debate
no we know what 's going to happen trump 's base does n't care about lies they do n't care about ads they just do n't care they wo n't move the needle and they 're going to vote for trump meanwhile the dems will continue to tell us that biden is fine blue maga will continue to bury their heads in the sand and people who wo n't vote for trump but need validation to vote for biden will see what everyone saw last night an old man who seemed incapable of forming a coherent thought there 's zero chance biden serves a second term its on the dnc to either replace him or give trump the win
why would trump want biden to drop out you throw in somebody 25 years younger and trump ca n't keep spouting nonsense unchecked he 's getting free punches
trump does n’t want him to drop out why would he
i guess the ca n't believe his luck
i think the right would be afraid of someone new getting in office biden is probably their best bet if they keep going in on him biden failed his country yesterday by letting trump get away with all his bs lies
trump knows he 's almost as old so he does n't want to emphasize the age issue too much plus biden is vulnerable and a known entity easy to attack and already unpopular
remember that trump barley won in 2016 and he is even less popular now
he should just remind people that trump was voted out last time and the shitshow that endured after talk about what good he has done and what his plans are simply say trump is all continuous superlative lies and wo n't spend too much time going after all of them but his team will fact check them on some corny website
as i 've said elsewhere it would be impossible to set up a primary and a full presidential campaign in less than 4 months the logistics grassroots movement and the name recognition for the leading nominee would n't be there for campaign victory newsom would be seen as elitist california and part of the establishment by the midwest swing voters and progressives whitmer and harris would both have trouble getting in as they 're women with harris being black a cop and who prosecuted non violent drug offenses buttigieg is gay which means he may have trouble with swing voters not to mention that any replacement other than harris would make black and poc voters angry as they 're passing over the vice president x200b if biden needed to be replaced it should 've been much earlier so that his replacement could build name recognition and a proper campaign with a few rallies under the candidates belt the only viable replacement would be harris as she can just take over the biden campaign and she 's well known she 's more unpopular than biden though and does n't have charisma according to the information from the latest polls the debate did n't seem to have much effect on voter perceptions so any calls for him to step down now are premature but biden should be giving harris more of a role in the campaign let her spread her wings and give her a chance to build a good reputation among voters so that she can become a viable replacement for biden if the worst comes to pass
trump ca n’t and wo n’t ever drop out he will never admit his defeat most importantly to him he wants presidential immunity to halt all of the court cases against him then he will also attempt to pardon himself basically if he drops out he ’ll be either going to prison or have to deal with consequences of his court cases he also will aim to extend his presidency beyond two terms ideally for him until he dies of old age
trump added that he does n’t believe democrats would ditch biden “ because he does better in polls than any of the democrats they talk about ” pointing to california gov gavin newsom vice president kamala harris and “ some of the others ” “ it ’s hard to believe but crooked joe biden polls better than those people ” he said
what would you say to the people that think you are n’t fit to run our country biden my cereal was under cooked this morning ummmm i carried my own bags on the golf course today toe box lookin good ahhhh breakfast ball fried egg incoming mulligan foot wedges ball dammit ummm get my caddy i neeeed aaaa nap my fitness is great btw
trump does n't have to do anything because the democratic party is in disarray and him taking a position would just unite them it was also smart of him to not hammer in that biden is failing the debate the guy is abhorrent but he definitely has some type of animal instinct for debating
he should drop out his performance was wretched trump spouted countless lies but biden was too lost to debunk any of them
it would be a disaster for trump if biden is replaced in a month when it becomes too late to replace him expect attacks on his age
the way he said he was a 6 handicap so smoothly let me know how easily it is for him to lie
trump could just sleep through this his next big event is inauguration day in january
he ca n't drop out because no other candidate has the fund raising infrastructure in place to catch up the dnc probably should 've taken more seriously the conservatives who 've been saying joe 's out of it mentally for the last few years
good biden is n't running this country successfully
seriously this is the most winnable race in modern history probably for democrats we ’re running against an even weaker trump than 2016 and 2020 all we need is someone who can make a case against that con man and look strong and capable to do the job for 4 years any of the relevant options can do that
trump knows that biden is the only person he has a shot of beating the only one some democrats are somehow in denial about this fact
' he studied so hard that he did n’t know what the hell he was doing ' trump 78 said of his 81 year old rival adding “ it ’s not his age it ’s his competence ” trump added that he does n’t believe democrats would ditch biden ' because he does better in polls than any of the democrats they talk about ' pointing to california gov gavin newsom vice president kamala harris and ' some of the others ' ' it ’s hard to believe but crooked joe biden polls better than those people ' he said
biden can not spend the whole debate being trumps fact checker that 's a huge job you 'd need 30 people data checking 7 days a week 12 hour shifts no off days no vacation 30 huge lies in 50 minutes joe does n't get to answer debate questions
what did trump bullshit about
but it only comes down to a small number of people to win over after that performance from biden i do n't see how he can persuade anyone who was wavering he needs to be replaced right now
he was clever of course but he pointed out the obvious elephant in the room of the denial of the party itself embarrassing
biden has done a decent job considering the absolute mess he inherited with that said i do wish he would retire and endorse either gavin newsom or gretchen whitmer i say this simply because we can not afford to have another trump presidency if you do n’t believe me ask the families of the people who died from covid
you actually think biden is going to bow out even if he did at this point who is gon na step in to replace him that would stand a chance at beating trump it ’s very clear after last night sleepy joe lost any and all voters that were on the fence before the debate this guy is in no way shape or form fit to run our country has n’t been since he got into office joe ca n’t string along a full sentence honestly what is there to debate here
well he would say that trump wants to do whatever he can to keep biden as his opponent
it ’s a waste of time to try and fact check someone in real time you have to dismiss it with one sentence biden already has a famous one “ that ’s a bunch of malarkey jack ” you dismiss the absurdity and make fun of him for it no one wants to look like a crazy person
bro biden could barely manage answering the completely uncritical questions i mean like mentally and physically speaking
biden set the rules of the debate including muting trump ’s mic getting rid of the audience and picking the moderators the entire debate format was created to allow biden to effectively fact check trump the second trump agreed to a debate with those rules a chill of fear should have gone down the spine of every rational democrat
they employed a totally traditional debate strategy when this moment in time called for something drastically different
everything nearly everything he said was a lie
what ’s unforgivable is all the politicians saying he is sharp as a tack and behind closed doors he ’s great they lied to us and kept him out of the public and anyone questioning his mental fitness was attacked this has been obviously for a while now and everyone has just had their heads buried in the sand and they waited way too long to take them out
i think and this is what i think a lot of people are already doing the trump campaign will now mostly avoid directly attacking joe biden other than the regular look he looked lost here clips and focus their attacks on jill biden as an and i do not support this to be clear but just stating what will be going around elder abuse enabler you will 100 % see this in the next few days if not already and the sad thing is a part of the democratic party elite the same part that tried to get him to step down last year will probably piggyback off of that to get him to step down i think overall this will be chaos all around if there is n't a very very clear rallying behind him which i do n't see how there could be in my opinion he should have spent part of his 4 years in office prepping a younger version of himself to take the reigns and that was also i believe his initial messaging when running in 2020 i do n't know what changed and why that changed but i think the administration has known he has good days and bad days for a while he has taken very limited questions from reporters and always scripted ones throughout the past few years and the white house has been denying claims he has been facing problems with his cognitive ability all the way up to the debate remember that wsj article from a few weeks ago and the reaction to it
more like we ca n't afford to have another joe biden presidency this country has gotten worse since joe biden has been in office
i do n’t understand what you ’re asking it looks like you ’re making opposing points i think biden should do the patriotic thing and drop out and i think kamala newsome whitmer or any of the other relevant options stand a solid chance of beating a very weak trump
it ’s very clear after last night sleepy joe lost any and all voters that were on the fence before the debate source
you 'd think that but polls back it up
and i would 've also had a time of answering those questions and i 'm in my 40s if i had to remember the exact shit i 'd done plus the questions from the moderators plus fact check all of trumps shit i 'd be sitting in the ground with drool coming out of my brain biden did just fine
biden did n't set the rules these were rules they both agreed too not trying to diminish that biden did poorly but this is just straight up not true and it comes off completely disingenuous to frame it that way
the entire debate format was created to allow biden to effectively fact check trump misinformation no debate should have candidates fact checking each other that 's why the moderators ask questions to each candidate biden would n't have been able to answer a single question passed his first takes time to fact check someone if 45 mins per person is allowed no time to fact check did n't see trump fact checking anything also did n't see him answer any of the questions but the same point holds that 's not how debates work
i just read an article on wsj that which is kind of telling also because i remembered reading article on politico too so a which is it and b if it is the former were they just hoping it would not become an issue in the debates
politicians lying to us that s what they do best anyone that actually believed that bs was either in denial or were n’t paying attention the last couple years everytime joe got in front of a microphone
biden refusing to step down as the nominee is very much like ruth bader ginsberg not safely retiring during the middle of one of obama ’s terms who could have replaced her with a younger non maga not crooked nominee they love having that much power today and do n’t want to give it up for the better good of a future society they will not live to see i lost nearly all respect for rbg because her refusal to retire laid the groundwork for conservatives to overturn roe
again tell that to the families of all the people that died from covid
he should have never ran to begin with his team should have done this along time ago he ’s clearly not the one making the decisions behind the scenes after that debate even with all the lies trump told that ’s nothing new for him he ’s been saying the same bs since he became elected him talking out his ass with the same rhetoric is what got him elected the first time nothing has changed with trump biden on the other hand well the entire nation saw it last night
wild take he could n’t even get through his closing speech which is pre rehearsed and only 2 minutes and he spent a week prepping when talking about abortion the democrats best issue he starting talking about a migrant who killed a young women he completely lost his train of thought multiple times and it was hard to understand him
bro that 's some extreme copium there biden is not fit to work in any job at all nevermind president of the country if the democrats insist on running him trump is going to be president sit virtually anyone else in that seat and they would have obliterated trump trump did n't do good he just was able to get away with a lot because of who was sitting across from him
the rules in place do n’t allow for a proper debate there should be no moderator just the 2 of them in a room podcast style or a debate where candidates have long periods of time to talk trying to discuss complex topics in 2 minutes with 1 minute to rebuttal is a crazy way to get to the bottom of things it ’s set up to be a spectacle not to have a nuisance discussion
no debate should have candidates fact checking each other good trump impersonation but a little too concise
i understand they are trying to do whatever they can to beat donald trump but lying to the american public and gaslighting us for pointing out what is obvious about biden is abhorrent it makes people completely lose faith in the institution and the administration given trump ’s threat to democracy the administration hiding this from the public and hoping it would work out was gambling on our democracy
i 'll tell that to families that take a foot to the face buying groceries every month
this brings us to the next question who is running the country because a guy that vacations for a week in preparation for that is clearly not running shit
i understood him just fine people are weird i also understood trump just fine understood everything just fine
that 's some extreme comments right there so very much ageism and wrong doing i can not even comment past the sure level of wrong good day sir madem
the rules in place do n’t allow for a proper debate there should be no moderator just the 2 of them in a room podcast style no moderators for a debate
i agree debates should be about substance it sad to say but even reddit moderation is better than these debates let them lay out the case for their america the moment one of them mentions the other shut off their mic that s it that s the moderators job ensure they only talk about what they intend to do in no way should it be allowed to turn into the back and forth bullshit we routinely witness its all a pathetic show now
not the job of the people being question to fact check others the job is to answer the given questions some fact checking happens but it 's not how debating is suppose to happen
i understand they are trying to do whatever they can to beat donald trump which is the most mindblowing thing you 'd think that the best way to beat donald trump would be to have a younger charismatic and overall cleaner version of biden that has n't had to deal with the israel palestine shitshow why why why this insistence on biden you do n't have to replace him with a radical progressive there 's a ton of centrist democrats that would do the job and just not carry the same baggage
ahh yes corporations screwing us for profit is the same as a president mishandling a pandemic
your guess is as good as mine
buddy your coping skills are impressive
have you ever had a debate with a friend or family member you do n’t need a moderator to have a proper discussion yes it can help sometimes if shit goes off the rails but it should be mostly the candidates having an open dialogue
100 % any centrist democrat would dominate in the election
corporations have been screwing us for profit for decades such a coincidence that joseph biden get 's elected and grocery prices just start rising jill biden is currently taking advantage of and abusing her elderly husband what a shame
a debate at a family level is n't the same thing as a proper form debate done at the professional level and yes i 've had moderators for family fights my grandmother loved to take up the task
gretchen whitmer can take michigan possibly pennsylvania i feel like i 'm banging my head against a table
some people here need to take a step back and really self evaluate you do n't have to live in another planet like maga does normal people can all see it with their own eyes this guy is n't just old he has clearly deteriorated mentally go look at his debate with paul ryan on 2012 then with trump in 2020 it 's a clear decline stop trying to deny what everyone else is clearly seeing and this is n't even what 's behind the scenes
nothing can happen between now and november to make biden younger or more relatable christian nationalists maga supreme court radicalism we are facing a cultural movement on the right that threatens the existence of democracy biden represents the minimal effort in adhering to traditions and norms and i do n’t believe minimal effort will save democracy
he can stay if he runs on a platform of expanding the supreme court to restore its legitimacy and rendering thomas and alito completely impotent
in addition to the headline the article includes when the survey asked respondents to choose between biden and former president trump 45 % chose the president and 44 % chose the former commander in chief which suggests there are voters who believe that biden should be replaced but might vote for him anyway if he were to remain a nominee interestingly the article also points out that shows president joe biden has lost no immediate ground to trump per morning consult 's findings we may have to wait for polls in a couple of days to see if anything changed after this debate
seriously what is there to lose here give us a candidate without any significant flaws clinton lost because too many people did n't like her including myself if biden loses it will be because he 's too old to be president for another 4 years give us anyone under the age of 70 and democrats will win
60 % of voters did n't even watch the debate give me a fuckin ' break
the dnc bots are doing a good job of downvoting these threads to oblivion but not the comments lmao
i think that people generally would have preferred someone else for a while polls have shown that biden has n’t had a positive approval rating in most polls for years but the dems do n’t have anyone in the wings that they can pull up right now biden would have to drop out on his own to let another person take his place and he ’s given no indication that he ’s going to do that so the dems have to run with their guy for better or worse if you ’re a democrat voter then get behind your guy the alternative was on stage last night
i ca n't believe we have to choose between these two what has this country come to
it would be impossible to set up a primary and a full presidential campaign in less than 4 months the logistics grassroots movement and the name recognition for the leading nominee would n't be there for campaign victory newsom would be seen as elitist california and part of the establishment by the midwest swing voters and progressives whitmer and harris would both have trouble getting in as they 're women with harris being black a cop and who prosecuted non violent drug offenses buttigieg is gay which means he may have trouble with swing voters not to mention that any replacement other than harris would make black and poc voters angry as they 're passing over the vice president x200b if biden needed to be replaced it should 've been much earlier so that his replacement could build name recognition and a proper campaign with a few rallies under the candidates belt the only viable replacement would be harris as she can just take over the biden campaign and she 's well known she 's more unpopular than biden though and does n't have charisma
my mom 73 and a life long democrat is now saying she will not vote for biden edit down voting does n't change anything this is a serious problem
“ you do n’t change horses midstream ”
how many of the people polled are republicans who want chaos in the democratic party
the headline does not match the math in the article and the figure include trump voting republicans who ’d only benefit by having biden replaced of democratic voters 21 % say biden should definitely not be replaced and 20 % say probably not when the survey asked respondents to choose between biden and former president trump 45 % chose the president and 44 % chose the former commander in chief the results were similar to those from a poll following trump 's criminal conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records linked to a 130 000 hush money payment that shows president joe biden has lost no immediate ground to trump per morning consult 's findings by the numbers still most respondents 57 % of those who viewed the debate said trump outperformed biden that includes 19 % of democrats 60 % of independents and 93 % of republicans
leave biden alone the boomers like him and that ’s all that matters since young people do n’t want to vote
it ’s kamala harris or no one the backbone of the democratic primary voters are black women replacing the current vp and next in line constitutionally with a white man or white woman instead of her is just asking the party to splinter it ’s biden or harris that ’s it there ’s no other choice you are n’t replacing the will of millions and millions of primary dnc voters
debates have no major bearing on who gets elected 60 % polled said trump won the debate but trumps favorability only rose 7 % while bidens dropped 3 % what will matter is how the independent and undecided voters feel on nov 5 2020 like it always does
serious question why is kamala the vp being totally passed over
lolz howabout kamala harris with biden as vp
pritzker would be great there needs to be a good messanger with energy
polls are fake news biden is going nowhere he is here to stay
replace biden if you want my vote
i 'm guessing most of those are republicans
to be fair something like 55 % wanted him replaced before the debate
60 % is way too low
but why it was n't that bad i mean he is still better than the alternative
ok but the polls could be off by 20 points they only poll landlines or something right
what 's their opinion about trump then dude is a shameless criminal and serial liar would they prefer that want him to keep running
replacing biden with an 11th hour stalking horse candidate at the convention should be infuriating to card carrying regular democratic voters one of the biggest arguments this election has been about “ defending democracy ” and you have a party that stopped a primary before it could begin threatened to blackball any candidate who challenged biden in a primary and who would then be willing to take the matter out of the hands of their own voters in a back room convention deal i ca n’t think of a more undemocratic way of “ defending democracy ” the party bosses and handlers knew this was a problem 2 years ago they knew it the democratic base has every right to be furious and they should be
the ny times makes an excellent point when they say consider his condition three years from now when he ’s trying to work with congress i question whether he would be strong enough to hold those nuts feet the the fire right now i wonder if he could go toe to toe with mitch mcturtle
the bitter truth was that bernie sanders invented maga when he got that bee in his bonnet to use the trans pacific partnership versus hillary clinton and kept hammering on that through the convention donald trump decided to run for president as a vanity project trump has never believed in anything he just randomly picked up what bernie sanders invented
60 % of russians that is
i do n’t care what you do at this point just stay out of the rest of the world ’s business
i do not understand the pro biden people nobody that was going to vote for biden would not vote for someone like whitmer it 's the independent voters and left leaning voters who would rather stay home than vote for biden whom we need to win over
whitmer actually polls much worse against trump
gretchen leapfrogging kamala is a tough position to be in for the dems if they do n't want to appear elitist they either need to go with kamala or go with whoever got 2nd in the last real primary democrats had i do n't think biden 's numbers will change much but he was still losing before the debate a candidate like sanders could dominate trump in a debate while bringing in younger voters whose turnout fluctuates greatly if anything the lack of real movement in the polls after this debate will be proof democrats are n't gon na lose voters if they switch candidates the voters are locked in beyond the young ones who might just stay home
andy beshear and roy cooper would be interesting candidates
hm i 'm not an american but i probably follow the us election a lot more than the average american for example i heard the names whitmer and newsom this election cycle not so much before i know the states they are from and that they are governors i did have to google both of them to know what they look like i ca n't name a single thing they 're done good or bad i do n't know how popular they are and if i do n't know these things the majority of americans outside their own states wo n't know either would n't you risk losing states like maine virginia new hampshire new mexico with someone like whitmer or newsom maybe even pennsylvania name recognition is huge in an election and so is being incumbent i would n't be surprised if kennedy stole a few extra % in those states against whitmer or newsom just because of his name and people do n't know who any of these people are why would more people go out and vote for someone they do n't know feels like most of the people here on this reddit only sees the election through your own eyes and yes in that case switching out biden does sound like a legit option at this point biden has been polling pretty close to trump if the polls are a bit wrong in biden 's favor he might actually be winning we have n't seen any polls from after the debate yet i saw a few polls with newsome polling like 10 15 points behind trump in jan feb in pa and the other swing states now i 'm not saying that these people would lose with 15 % in the swing states but i 'm saying that there is no evidence that they would do better than biden there is very little time to get the people to know them and i 'm not sure if they have enough funds or time to actually pull that off they would have to spend money in states biden would n't just because people do n't know them i also think the election is far enough away so that people will forget about this debate
yeah i got a real hardon for gretchen
skipping over harris a black woman for a white woman who was n't picked in the primary probably wo n't play well with african american voters a key demo needed for any democrat to win
yep there is so much rationalization it ’s really sad that people wo nt acknowledge what is happening all the evidence is there but they have to be open to seeing it
if saving democracy requires democrats to win every election from now on then i have some bad news for you
to claim that democrats stand for democracy is absolutely ridiculous we do n't know who makes decisions we have no idea who appoints the cabinet they expect us to believe that the guy we saw on the stage last night is running america sorry but enough is enough
what kind of american are you
you want to risk it all and get trump for someone who ca n't even string a coherent sentence together at the debate
bidens running a radical leftist administration at least trump wants to preserve the country i grew up in instead of turning it into a nearly maoist nightmare with struggle sessions for white people
we do n’t have a democracy and never have it ’s a constitutional republic
did you forget about the senate
no fan of the current scotus but that ’s a terrible idea
and rendering thomas and alito completely impotent that 's not how the supreme court should work yes i realize republicans have tried to do the same thing i wish both parties would stop fucking with the court like that
biden most certainly lost ground among independents team stay home gained a lot of voters last night there is no scenario where that turns out well for biden
what is there to lose here literally nothing if you 're voting against trump you 'd vote for a park bench if it was running against him and rightly so which leaves the swing voters and moderates and not a damn single one of them actually prefers biden over the dem alternatives let alone now those swing voters need to be the focus
even if biden becomes incapacitated in a year there is still vp so you 'll get 60 year old president anyways so voting for biden is a no brainer
maybe they did n’t watch it but they damn sure have heard about it from fam friends work or seen clips on fb x news sc etc etc etc it ’s 2024 news is everywhere instantly
i think 60 % of us wanted both candidates replaced before the debate too
if they did the numbers would be worse for biden
i saw some comments saying 60 % of people wanted biden to not run again in the last year anyway so that has n't changed
exactly and 48 % of voters want trump to be able to run against the weakest possible candidate
whitmer beshear we would n’t even have to debate
i hear you it ’s either an elderly guy who wants to preserve democracy or an elderly guy who wants to turn the county into a dictatorship
we do n't have to he can do the right thing and step down and endorse someone else he needs to be convinced to do so
harris has made herself unpopular her being passed over is n't going to make minorities angry minorities are n't simpletons that just look at someone 's skin color and decide they 're voting for that person they understand kamala harris is unlikable and very unpopular and there 's good reason for it exaggerated a bit but regardless it is gavin newsom is a very good politican and talker he can win over a lot of people his main problem is his baggage and the perceptions of being governor of california buttegig is n't a very good politician and comes across as disingenuous and weak it 's not because he 's gay this is part of the problem with the democratic party you guys think it 's all about these labels and steer conversations into unimportant bullcrap put someone that is remotely likeable and does n't come off as disingenuous and he or she will completely wipe the floor with trump we saw this in 2020 the real excitement was worth sanders but when he did n't get the nomination biden still won because he just seemed like a normal politican and that 's all you need to beat trump if they can get someone exciting then they will win in a landslide if they keep the guy that looks like he 's got less than 5 years of life in him independents are n't going to vote for him republicans are n't going to cross over and he 's going to loose a lot of democrats especially those currently struggling so where is the path to victory where does he gain votes from this campaign is embarrassing and is going to hurt the democratic party in the eyes of normal people for a very long time how are you going to believe the people that were denying what you could see with your own eyes
no primary needed was n’t necessary the two times the dnc shafted bernie
why do you not like the rebound the country is currently experiencing or do you prefer felons
if the horse starts shitting blood and collapsed i 'm changing fucking horses
pretty racist assumption that black voters can only vote based on skin color and can intellectually evaluate a candidate kamala harris is very unpopular with the general public and would be a poor replacement choice the only person worse would be hillary clinton i do n't understand why there is this need to prop up these immensely unpopular candidates
it 's a fact not an opinion it 's going to be harris if it 's not him is where we 're at
usually yes but this debate was a car crash for biden and trumps ' team just have to keep pushing out videos showing bidens terrible responses they do n't have to do much else to win over any swing voters this has to be the worst outcome of a tv debate of all time
she does n't connect with anyone except young women and minorities and she 's too west coast not enough
kamala is the only person that wants to see herself become president
run a candidate from a city that champions recreational drug use in the streets blatant mass property crime and has business after business closing up shop to find greener pastures against a guy that says we have a crime problem and an economy in shambles how would she plan on winning at least 1 of michigan wisconsin or pennsylvania let alone all 3 which she ’d most certainly have to do kamala as the ticket is playing checkers in an election where you need the most elite 4d chess player on the planet
so you ’d rather see trump win than biden
people on here can try and bully you into voting for biden all they want but what you 're saying is what a lot of americans are saying after the debate that are n't on the maga boat the anti trump argument can only go so far this is crazy everyone is in such a fantasy world
47 % of democrats polled said he should be replaced a plurality polled also support biden over trump
nope i think it ’s anyone with functioning eyes and ears that watched last night
the nyt editorial board is not comprised of republicans and they are calling for biden to step down
this is the exact argument bernie supporters made in 2016 anyone who was voting clinton was going party line anyways
i will point out that even in this poll biden has a narrow lead 45 44 over trump but enthusiasm is important and manypeople might be enthusiastic to vote against a candidate but very few seem enthusiastic to vote for a candidate this year
i do none of these suggestions are electable vs biden in poll after poll whitmer can do it because i say so polls say wrong wrong wrong it 's just a name rec thing and trump wo n't vet her every word every single increment of her past life and statements also attaching biden to her she 'll just get no vetting scot free also see newsom neither is stupid nor is bernie nor is kamala there 's a reason they 're protecting biden
a party that ca n't stand behind its own presumptive nominee when the going gets tough is not one i can take seriously i would be hard pressed to vote for whoever replaces him in this scenario
trump supporters maybe they ’d for sure want biden the democratic nominee
i do n't understand the people that want to replace him are we really going to 1 lose the incumbent advantage 2 give credibility to republican talking points 3 replace our candidate in the 11th hour all because of one bad debate i ca n't believe i 'm the one defending biden when i 'm the progressive that wanted bernie in ' 20 but here we are
that poll has 22 % undecided largely because they have n't heard of whitmer i assume that would change quickly if she were the new nominee and she would gain most of biden 's support if he dropped out
february 2024 back when we were told biden was doing cartwheels
i do n’t doubt that she did in february i think it might be slightly different now i also think these polls skew towards an incumbent as the presumptive nominee and she would poll differently if the nomination was open without biden in the running
that poll does n't have bernie sanders on it despite him getting 2nd in the last two real democratic primaries and despite bernie always polling well in head to heads against trump in past elections better than hrc in every major head 2 head of 2016 and better than biden in many 2020 head 2 heads bernie does n't have the same cognitive issues of biden and is a proven tested and hardened debator with a knack for exposing the corruption of the billionaire class hard to argue besides maybe kamala there is anyone beyond bernie who is more deserving of a democratic nomination given his past performance
andy beshear is a perfect vp too soft spoken for president but would go a long way to fix the dem rep split
really 'cause i do n't think they 're stupid and they probably realize harris is widely unpopular
i thought the trump people were the kings of rationalizing but r politics is doing some hardcore mental gymnastics right now it 's going to look like ronald regans map if we ca n't get back to earth
i do n’t think this threat will last for that long to be honest in 2028 gen z and millennials will make up the majority of voters trump wo n’t be fit to run and republicans will never be able to win over the younger majority this election is make or break it ’s why republicans have been particularly ruthless this time around
fascism following late state capitalism is an inevitable step
what kind of question is that
what color is the sky on your planet
nothing about biden is leftist the right has brainwashed conservatives into thinking anything good for citizens is marxism what trump did is he redistributed a trillion dollars from working class people to the billionaire class through tax cuts that will never trickle down that drives hyper inflation and all that money just sits in investment portfolios making the rich richer instead of changing hands frequently and driving the real economy republicans ban books hyper focus on minority groups like trans people to diminish individual rights and freedoms for everyone republicans enable grifter tax evading churches to attack individual autonomy and liberty republicans expand government through militarizing police that hyper manage citizens and limit liberties republicans want to privatize schools so only the rich can get education same with healthcare republicans deregulate corporations so that they can profiteer and only the rich can afford proper medical care i can go on and on
racial leftist points to a corporate neoliberal you ca n't make this shit up lmfao
maoists sure wish biden was a maoist
i see you consume large amounts of agitation pundit propaganda a republic is a representative form of government that is ruled by a charter or constitution a democracy is a government that is ruled according to will of the majority the us is both but by all means if you think it ’s only a republic then you should never vote again and trust that the noblemen will more or less decide things for you
you do n’t think that announcement would spur turnout and down ballot voting too
i do n't doubt that there is some overlap between independents and those who plan to stay home but has there been any polling among independents regarding this debate yet the polls on 538 so far do n't suggest that much has changed post debate which makes me think that we may get better info in a couple of days i 'm sure pollsters asking whether people plan to stay home will be a frequently asked question
exactly this is completely irrelevant and meant to demoralize
but the dems do n’t have anyone in the wings that they can pull up right now again this is a fact
i believe and i think many people will agree here most people in the democratic party are also guys that want to preserve democracy and not necessarily elderly i get 2020 sure he had the name recognition as obama 's vp he was n't as old trump administration handled covid like shit and the democratic party did n't really have anyone else at the moment i ca n't for the life of me see what biden has in 2024 that prevented the democratic party from at least having a back up younger dem prepped to take over biden ran as a one term president in 2020 for christ 's sake
anyone who follows trump or is an undecided swing voter right now is clearly stupid not just minorities so quite a few of them will be angry at the vice president being passed over as a replacement biden gave quite an energetic speech this morning and polling suggests that support for him or trump did n't really change because of the debate calls for him to resign are premature we should at least give him a chance to step up and put this behind him it 's early enough in the campaign that if biden keeps this energy up voters can dismiss the first debate as a fluke or a bad day
well the dnc would select newsom if given the chance and it would cause a split with progressive voters with some who may choose to stay home come election night
i want someone who can lead us for the next 4 years last night ’s performance showed joe is near entering a nursing home let ’s get a candidate who is younger
i 'd like to think democrats would n't replace him with a felon
and how can anyone else build a viable campaign in less than 4 months the logistics to even set up a campaign take a lot of money and time signs tv internet ads merchandise donation money meet and greets a grassroots movement and campaign rallies are needed to build up a candidate and i think 4 months is too short of a time to build up a good campaign which can beat trump harris can take over the biden campaign which is why she 's the only viable alternative
it ’s not my assumption it ’s the reality of who the dnc is and how popular harris is within it there ’s a reason bernie got zero traction with the dnc why biden succeeded and why harris is his vp
were n't they pushing videos of biden falling rolling staring at nowhere for months already did it help much ratings are pretty much even now
why then is n't sanders considered next he got 2nd in the last 2 primaries instead of just being handpicked by delegates nobody doubts he could dominate trump in a debate motivates the group of voters whose turnout fluctuates the most do people really think older democrats would leave the party and go back to trump after all he has done i do n't seems like only upside
minorities young women so the base of the party then got it really going to win an election without those groups not
she is the first women of color vp does n’t she deserve a fair shot
he was n't going to vote for a dem anyway he is just bullshitting for karma
if i wanted trump to win i 'd be happy with biden on the ticket
the anti trump argument can only go so far except it ca nt what are you talking about
so 53 % of democrats do n't want that
it was wrong then and it ’s wrong now this election is n’t about strongly partisan voters it ’s about undecided voters you ’re not going to convince undecided voters to vote for your party by causing historic levels of chaos within your own party just months before the election
polls are absolutely meaningless in close elections hillary was ahead of trump in every single poll but lost because the voters who showed up for obama in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania did not turn out for her i genuinely do not understand how people think that an 81 year old biden who is showing clear signs of cognitive decline and had mediocre approval numbers before the disastrous debate is going to get anywhere near the level of turnout that he did in the middle of the pandemic in 2020
trump will vet her every word ok and biden ca n't even put words together he most certainly could not take the heat last night what is the point of trotting out a shitshow because we 're too conservative non politically speaking to take a shot on a better candidate let 's just pretend beating trump is a cakewalk like 2016
vetting is a pretty big deal the amount of skeletons that can come out of the closet real or not without enough news cycles to overcome it is a problem everyone knows everything there is to know about biden nationwide anyone else nope kamala polls worse than biden for whatever reason she excites no one if you pick anyone else you 've fractured the party none of the potential 2028 candidates would want to be the hail mary and tarnish a future run it 's all just a pipe dream that is n't worth entertaining it is what it is make sure anyone you know is n't apathetic about it
c'm on dude you 'd vote trump or stay home if newsome or whitmer become the nominee how are you possible better off that way
centering this moment around team dynamics is wrong and makes a person a bad citizen we have a duty in a democracy especially in this moment of unchecked fascist descent loyalty ai n't it in fact that 's kind of literally the opposite of everything a responsible democratic citizen should be doing i do n't usually give the founders credit for much but boy they sure as shit called the game re political parties and what they would do to this country
that 's a strange argument to apply to this situation how tough does the going need to get exactly before you would n't be hard pressed to support a replacement
when he loses in november we ’ll say we told you so
1 lose the incumbent advantage the incumbent advantage is irrelevant when the economy is in dire straits and the outlook is grim i 'm not stupid enough to think biden is at fault but guess what most people are 2 give credibility to republican talking points he already gave credibility to republican taking points during the debate that 's the only reason this discussion is happening 3 replace our candidate in the 11th hour in 2020 biden was n't even officially the nominee until august he still is n't officially the candidate in 2024 this is the earliest debate ever normally they wait until after the conventions have officially crowned their nominees so no it is n't all that crazy that someone else could be the nominee by august if biden steps down gracefully and puts his endorsement behind a chosen candidate it 's not even the first time that has happened look up lyndon b johnson those circumstances were far more chaotic and had far more divisiveness among the democrats and yet his replacement still only lost by less than 1 percent 500k votes there would n't be nearly that kind of split among the democrats because instead of being turn by a war we 're united against a would be dictator
i actually do n't think biden 's numbers will change much voters are way more locked in than we realize but if they did switch to bernie you could get higher turnout with the youth vote while losing few older voters this debate will be proof of how locked in older generations are
and you think 5 months before the election is a great time to attempt to elevate a largely unknown politician to the national stage
a women will never be elected in the united states for president unless she has an r next to her name
that 's not going to happen although i expect we 'll see sanders campaigning for whoever 's on the ticket this is not a game of who 's deserving it 's about math
what kind of convention scenario exists where the democrats can come up with a candidate to “ defend democracy ” in a way that makes it somewhat look like the will of their voters versus a primary that was stolen the dnc royally royally screwed the pooch here
supreme court is making a power grab as we speak republicans have instituted religiosity in schools and courthouses it is already a criminal offense in many states to claim ownership of your own body while i agree the current youth will break the authoritarian trend given the chance project 2025 is a real thing and there is a colossal effort happening right now to make sure today 's youth never gets that chance
in 2028 gen z and millennials will make up the majority of voters i used to really take stock in this i thought it would help out a lot in 2024 vs 2020 but i actually see more young people being radicalized than i expected i live in a pretty liberal area and many of the kids at my local high school are trumpers despite being raised in an school where trans kids were accepted whole heartedly and the school allowed walkout protests for george floyd there ’s a strange backlash against progressive thought
wokeism and crt has a fair amount of overlap with the type of stuff that went on in maos cultural revolution the parallels are there and it is concerning
i think whatever the pollsters find will be reflective of the knee jerk reaction from the debate polls did n’t shift much for trump or biden after the ny trial verdict the difference between the 2 is that the court room was closed to cameras and the debate laid bare in hd every single concern voters had about biden and put an exclamation point on them
biden 's performance at the debate is what demoralized people
i agree i appreciate biden picking up the pieces from the trump presidency and moving us forward but i do wish he would pass the torch on to the next generation of leaders however the worst thing that could happen to our country is to endure another four years of terrible trump leadership
to be fair given his debate he 's still going to be a one term president
i do n't think regular people are stupid for looking at 2 people and one ca n't form a proper full sentence and deciding both choices suck and staying home most people do n't know all the garbage that trump has done and biden does not look physically and mentally fit to lead a country stop gaslighting and calling people stupid for what everyone can see plain with their own eyes nobody watched that teleprompter campaign speech this morning what everyone did watch is one of the worst debate performances ever people have been yelling for months wayyy before this that biden is not fit to go against trump and should have just stepped down after one term this is n't premature it 's long overdue
a lot more progressives are going to stay home with biden on the ticket
this we are getting closer and closer to world war biden ca nt do this shit anymore folks need to stop kidding themselves its simple find a better candidate and let the voters decide why are folks here so afraid of that biden was never the best candidate to begin with
the debate was a bad look for biden i did n't expect that his presentation was poor but he 's not a movie star what his administration is doing is good and it 's helping a lot of people trumps did not that 's what matters trump 's a horrible person and only cares about himself also a convicted felon he 's a danger to this country he 's a liar and a cheater he 's also almost as old as biden and he has a butthole mouth
facts only she would have coh to do so then but whichever vp she picked would be divisive and we 'd likely be in a bigger mess period
because trump is a very poor candidate and does n't need much to beat him signs ads and merchandise are n't needed for presidential campaigns all eyes will be on that person this is n't some senate or congressional race they need some guys campaign rallies and to lay out a clear vision this can be done 4 months is plenty of time to do some rallies and lay out your plan maybe a debate with trump if he would accept it i doubt he would though there 's a reason he accepted 1 with biden but 0 with his republican competition
bernie had insane traction with voters and had plenty of support with black voters what are you talking about what are you seeing that harris is popular are you talking about dnc staffers and insiders because that 's not who votes bernie was winning the primary up until everyone except warren dropped out and endorsed biden
that 's not a good thing
my choice for vp was val demings from fl
this is what i thought she should be a no brainer to run against trump
if you run a candidate focusing on their gender or color you 're setting yourself up for a major defeat remember i m with her
define fair shot 'cause from where i sit replacing biden is only worth the upheaval if it gets us a candidate more likely to carry some of the swing states and i really do n't think harris meets that criteria
there 's only two people that poll worse against trump than joe that 's kamala and hillary fair or not fair it is what it is
not because of that at least she should be chosen if chosen for her exceptional leadership i hope that the administration uses its time to groom her for the position in 4 years or earlier god forbid letting her stay in the background like they did the first time around did n’t do her any favors
except it always costs karma around here to be critical of biden
everyone knows who trump is and he 's done basically any negative you can think of already people are n't changing they 're mind on him anymore
which is why hillary won
you almost got there but then went the entirely wrong direction with it we are living in the era of historic chaos changing out a terrible candidate with months left till the election would barely be a blip on the radar these days you ’re not going to convince undecided voters to vote for your party by continuing to run a candidate that just showed them he belongs in hospice more than the white house
he ’s also running against someone who not was not a convicted criminal adjudicated rapist and adjudicated fraudster who tried to overturn an election in 2020
just curious are you aware biden has a lifelong stutter
vetting is a pretty big deal the amount of skeletons that can come out of the closet real or not without enough news cycles to overcome it is a problem most of the names being mentioned are being groomed for 2028 they have already been thoroughly vetted
certainly not vote for trump or the gop and ultimately it 'd be a difficult conversation i 'd have to have with myself i think whitmer would be a fine president but not via shivving the party 's own presumptive nominee and incumbent president over a debate performance it would be a tough vote for me to cast i do n't think there 's even the slightest chance it will happen though
if the president has a legitimate health scare forcing him to withdraw or a death in the family that necessitates his stepping away from the campaign or some equivalent scenario i would respect that decision otherwise run the campaign all the way to election day it 's not over until the votes are counted
if he loses in november we 'll be saying you all told us so
the incumbent advantage is irrelevant when the economy is in dire straits and the outlook is grim i do n't agree with that assessment at all people know biden and they know he can beat trump because he 's done it before i wo n't pretend to know what you mean by this statement but i do n't agree things are in dire straits it was one bad debate and trump was not exactly stellar considering he lied through his teeth and said nothing of substance he already gave credibility to republican taking points during the debate that 's the only reason this discussion is happening no he definitely bungled that debate but that does n't mean he has dementia or that he is n't capable of being the president or a million other allegations the republicans make it would be worse for the democrats to actually replace him than to let him recover which he can and will do
yeah this is game 7 it 's a must win we got ta bench biden and go with the younger talent our chances are better with whitmer or newsome or pritzker or any number of other democrats than with biden i firmly believe that
its got a better chance of winning than the guy who just told the country he beat medicare and stared dead eyed into space for the better part of the debate
a random person from the street is a better choice nobody wants someone that you would n't trust with a drivers license as president
most countries have relatively short election seasons so it 's not exactly unprecedented
if hillary had payed a bit more attention to worker 's concerns in the midwest she 'd be president today she got a higher popular vote and was only 0 5 % behind in wi mi and pa
yeah that 's all electability is
the math supports bernie more than any other candidate 2024 is a very unique election after jan 6 and roe democrats do n't have to worry as much about older democrats fleeing back to trump because they do n't get a bland enough candidate those voters are locked in this will be proven by the polling barely moving despite how poor biden 's performance was and turnout does n't fluctuate much except with younger voters where bernie has proven he can marginally improve their turnout enough to matter in a general if they attack bernie 's age it wo n't hold up after the debate nobody cared that biden was twice paul ryan 's age in that debate because biden performed phenomenally he just ca n't anymore for health reasons that bernie does n't share furthermore anyone else besides kamala will create havoc within the ranks even kamala who polled at like 2 % before dropping out in 2020 could be seen as the dnc forcing an anti democratic process
their primary was non existent nobody is going to feel screwed
in all of america 14 million people voted for biden in a primary election this year that 's less than voted for him in the 2020 primary that 's less than the people who will vote in november in just the state of california and it 's way fucking less than the 50 million who tuned into the disastrous debate this week those 14 million will be fine voting again for a different democrat i 'm more concerned about the hundreds of millions of americans and a 2nd trump term
please elaborate tell me what mao did that you 'd consider wokeism for that matter give me any specific policy that biden and mao shared
that 's a reasonable expectation to have but until the polls come out with more information it 's a bit too speculative for me i 'll be keeping a keen eye out for now
i like how you framed it like yeah one of those elderly guys wants to end democracy but one does n't not a clear difference wow
anyone who thinks project 2025 abortion bans or a president who wants to be dictator are in any way acceptable enough to stay home for is n't worthy of respect that goes for anyone wilfully living under a rock for the last 4 years maybe it would 've been best if biden was a one term president and had groomed a good replacement by now but rome ca n't be built in a day and like it or not we 're stuck with biden or harris as it 's too close to the election to pick anyone else yes biden 's old and his performance in the debates was terrible he looked half dead on stage but i just do n't see another way forward anyone who trades democracy for cheaper eggs is not a patriot
well he is now he 's also the incumbent when is the last time an incumbent was switched trump should be used to losing by now he 's so good at it
we ca n't underestimate trump he 's a stupid liar who does n't have much support outside of his own base but we ca n't dismiss the advantages biden has he 's the incumbent well known and he appeals to all sides of the political spectrum thinking that trump is easy to beat is the kind of hubris the democrats had which allowed trump to win in 2016 it would be less risky to stay the course and have biden step up and give the energy and vigor that voters expect from a leader rather than make a risky bet on another candidate so close to the election
it 's not a no brainer because she like most other dems has problems with white voters as well but she 's the vp and obv biden 's heir apparent as things stand if it 's not him then it 'll be her and whatever dnc establishment candidate they deem appealing at this point in time
it 's shallow it 's pandering and it suggests that the most important thing about a candidate is their idpol
have you seen whitmer and newsom 's polls worse than joe
harris was in the position of being the 51st vote tie breaking vote in the senate it limited her exposure
no she won because she beat trump in the debates oh wait she still lost even though she won the debates
i mean he was always those things we knew exactly who trump was in 2020 he was talking about denying election results throughout the election season we already knew he was a rapist and a criminal and a fraud and a moron etc etc etc you ca n't pretend that anyone 's opinion on him has really changed even making it ' official ' by convicting him is irrelevant his supporters just think it was a political hit job and his detractors already knew he was a crook biden is running against the same trump but trump is not running against the same biden
you guys keep saying that as if it 's going to somehow convince all these trump voters of anything what you 're all so frustrated by is the fact that we 've seen trump be trump for a decade now none of what he did was new it 's the same as 2016 and 2020 the convictions do n't matter his record does n't matter none of what he does matters because it 's already expected that 's why no one 's going on about the fact he lied we knew he was going to do that from the start what we did n't expect was the condition joe was in and him to go on meandering and stuttering rants that end with him saying we 're going to defeat medicaid followed by an open mouth blank stare into the camera the novel thing is what people will naturally fixate on trump is just background noise at this point you can tune him out at this point
i have an idea what if trump had to run against someone younger
gaslight me mommy tell me about how a stutter makes you stop mid sentence and talk about beating medicare
i appreciate the honest answer my hope is biden will choose to step down i agree a fractured party is disastrous
where does the candidate being unable to communicate with the outside world due to debilitating dementia fall on that spectrum surely closer to the forced to withdraw
lol the conventions have n’t even happened yet it ’s game 1 at most terminally online people like ourselves regularly declare “ this is the end of enter candidate ” this debate wo n’t matter in 3 months
leaving kamala behind could alienate some voters or depress turnout if you are n't gon na kamala you need better justification than the state they live in sanders got 2nd in the last real primary that 's solid justification
but no potus is trusted with a driver 's license even after leaving office
i 'm not sure whether the math truly supports bernie but the dnc sure as hell does n't so it 's not going to happen replacing biden may cause havoc period although i expect most voters will be quietly relieved although the khive will be outraged if harris is n't the pick whether it 's now or in 2028 most dems would be relieved about that as well as for forcing an antidemocratic process the dnc has never given a shit before so why would they start now
it 's funny these people are telling you polls do n't matter then when you bring up gavin newsom and whitmer they use polls to discredit them
he 's in fact objectively stronger than in either 2016 or 2020 right now mainly because while trump has not gained any real support overall he 's succeeded very well in breaking down his opposition inch by inch into divisions divide and conquer being his strategy while his cult is diehard for him no matter what trump has never had better polling in h2hs than in this cycle in 2024 against any dem with a name in fact i think it 's understated that he 's not weak at all anymore vs a generic r arguably the opposite
biden had abysmal approval ratings before the debate there 's no undoing the other night he 's not getting younger if he stays then this is over trump wins biden lost all the normal people in that debate all he can hope for is trump does something to loose an equal amount
they 've had a fraction of the national exposure that joe hillary and kamala have had you have to consider unfavorables and undecideds not just positive numbers
and a big part of that was an alienated left that largely stayed home the same thing is happening with biden
she got crushed in the debates
sure but republicans specialize in moving the goal post there is always going to be “ one ” thing wrong with whatever candidate dems put up and we ’ll keep saying “ if only if only ”
i 'm saying the election is game 7 democracy is at stake not hyperbole
yeah right up until the next debate where he may or may not have the same exact performance but by that time it really will be too late do you really want to gamble with that when he 's already wildly unpopular
i would take harris over biden at this point honestly though i honestly doubt she could win i love bernie but he 's even older than biden though admittedly a lot sharper the best bet in my opinion would be a midwesterner from a swing state which whitmer fulfills but you are right that passing over harris would have to be addressed
that 's a fantasy they 'd be more likely to offer the nomination to a republican than they would to bernie and yes the state they live in matters if we 're talking about a swing state we 'll need in november electoral math is a legitimate justification and a big one
although the khive will be outraged is harris is n't the pick agreed but it is harder to argue against bernie who did do well in the last 2 primaries and has already been campaigning in swing states replace kamala with someone like gavin or gretchen and they will only be more upset i honestly think republicans have gone so far right that even much of the business community could get behind sanders if it is the most reliable way of stopping trump those tariffs would destroy the economy
they 've also had a fraction of the vetting scrutiny and attacks from the reps or the press as any of the above or anyone who ran in the last primary so we know nothing about them that could n't further jeopardize things as is 4 months out think about it
and removing biden wo n’t alienate his supporters it ’s a guaranteed loss if you deliberately disenfranchise the people who voted for him in 2020 knowing he would likely run again as the incumbent in 2024
text princeton%2c%20n j % 20%2d%2d%20hillary%20clinton while%2031%25%20chose%20donald%20trump why would anyone value your input on biden when you ’re so confidently wrong about clinton
i agree if trump is elected the world ends within 30 years i ’m not being hyperbolic either
if anything the debate proved age is just a number very few are saying trump looked too old despite being of similar age to both biden and bernie biden 's health is the real problem not his age at least bernie can motivate younger voters whose turnout fluctuates the most and can even the most corporate democrat really argue that older democrats would flock back to trump instead of holding their nose and voting sanders maybe before roe before 1 6 nobody is leaving now just because sanders is more progressive than biden
probably what matters more is not giving off the appearance of the dnc corruptly choosing a candidate behind the scenes bernie earned 2nd place last go around polled well in head 2 heads against trump and motivates the demographic of voters whose turnout is most volatile biden is n't the dnc and 2024 is n't a normal election it is n't like 2020 at all not after jan 6 and roe democrats have very little reason to worry about losing older democrat voters to trump they are n't gon na switch sides after a little red baiting by corporate media they are locked in what matters is getting younger voters out and not creating a controversy over anti democratic processes
do n't bogart that doobie man khive 's not going to be less outraged if the pick is sanders instead of newsom or whitmer and we do not live in a universe where sanders would be the pick
given a choice between hypothetical skeletons and actual visuals of biden faceplanting i 'll risk the skeletons if replacing biden is being discussed behind the scenes i expect the party will do a crash review of whomever they 're considering as a replacement before suggesting anyone it would n't surprise me if they 've already done some internal vetting on some of the names being bandied about as they 're possible candidates in 2028 in fact it would surprise me if that had n't happened
i voted for him in 2020 and would n't feel disenfranchised at all in fact part of what helped me be confident voting for him in 2020 was his repeated public assurances that he would only serve one term
and biden wo n't beat him at this rate
sanders has been in congress longer than any of them and placed 2nd the last time we had a real vote of actual democrats they would also salivate at the thought of bernie being only a 1 term president for the same age reasons while gavin or whitmer would certainly run again maybe they would be as outraged but they should n't be
sanders whitmer newsom and harris have all come out opposed to the idea so i 'd say it 's unlikely but i actually agree with lichtman on one thing we will lose guaranteed if we replace the incumbent potus with people who got no votes in the primary in 2024 to do so period it will offend some bloc biden is holding onto right now imo
you should probably work on empathizing with people that are n’t you i also voted for him but that does n’t mean i supported him throughout the election as i voted for bernie but some people did actually support him and continue to support him they are neither you nor me but i can still recognize that they exist and would be pissed off for being disenfranchised his repeated public assurances that he would only serve one term do n’t act like you have the answer when you do n’t even know the facts of the situation
of course they 've come out opposed to the idea so has obama no dem politician is going to publicly tell biden he should step down and it 's unlikely we 'll have any idea of what 's going on behind the scenes unless and until biden drops out endorsing someone else replacing biden is risky so is retaining him right now i 'd guess that they 're spinning as hard as they can and hoping it will all blow over do n't think that 's going to happen though
the reagan branch of the gop should be rolling over in their graves that the current gop is so russia friendly putin is not a friend to the usa nato western civilization he wants to destroy us so that russia 's china 's cynical version of politics replaces western dominance as much as i ding the us for certain international moves we are keeping a much more dangerous force from rising to power and horrors wait for all of us if he succeeds
probably because his prize pony was in it
he loves anything that divides this nation and he wants trump to win
nobody caught the statement of trump when he said something like i spoke to putin about his dreams of ukraine if biden was n't completely paralyzed he would just ask if that was before or after he withheld military aid to blackmail zelensky which got him impeached which should immediately raise some further questions but nope trump again got to repeat the russia russia russia hoax narrative very important to repeat x3 that j6 was caused by the democrats post birth abortions and all other types of fucking insane shit he says and that again had no pushback even with dedicated time for rebuttals with muted mics
but americans do n’t read anymore instead they get debates in small bites howls on social media tweets and tik toks and the overwhelming reaction post debate is that it ’s a three alarm crisis for the biden campaign music to putin ’s ears is his argument that people did n't watch this debate
it does n't matter the ukraine war has been handed over to europe poland 's defense ministry has uttered the strategic ambiguity proclamation so they are going in a couple of years from now with hundreds of thousands of soldiers from their planned expansion to 300 000 there is no way for russia to ever again cross the dnipro river so at best russia can decide to immolate 300 000 of their own killed to wrest away the parts of ukraine east of the dnipro after an entire summer campaign i do not expect russia to come close to kramatorsk let alone to threaten any major breakthrough
the most bad ass country of modern history is limited to these two jokers for such an important leadership role one is downright senile and the other is a convicted felon who exploits hatred and division neither has a solid plan going forward the next four years can not go by fast enough straight horseshit
i did was absolutely terrible as was the porn star comment trump nosedived in the second half many chose not to pay attention to that unfortunately which is what i think saved biden from taking on significant water overall
that ’s the problem with the dems they are always clutching their pearls i say this as a staunch liberal
i think the main problem is they hold onto old decorum and keep these gentlemen agreements acting like the republicans are doing the same
i 'm quoting the author not putin
democrats get in office and they ca n’t pass an immigration bill with majority support without the senate parliamentarian signing on republicans get in office and steamroll democracy and any institution in their path the contrast is hilarious
whelp going to go ahead and delete that my bad
democrats have never gotten lots done with slim majorities the best performance we have ever seen was during the 2021 2022 period when a surprising amount of progress was made despite a 50 50 senate
it ’s probably because republicans refuse to sign off on anything from the democratic party then when dems do concede on points reps pull even further away until the bill is to their liking and stripped of the original intent reps come with their own bill and they tell dems they ’ll make sure to give it forward on the next bill which dems believe over and over and then reps never do
the thing is i m looking at post debate polling and nothing really changed yeah people thought trump won the debate annndd it moved no one to his side because they still fucking hate him t 2 from susa b 1 from morning consult b 3 from ipos the race is in the same place it was before i m worried the democratic doom spiral were seeing might hurt biden more than the actual debate did
what a disaster of a night for democrats
the way axios formats their columns gives me a headache almost as bad as the one i got watching the debate last night while i 'm glad schumer is open to someone other than biden at the top of the ticket i fear that party leaders ultimately wo n't muster up the courage to tell biden what he needs to hear and to step aside and will instead continue to coddle him and then act shocked in november
why was n't there a public warning about biden 's cold and semi laryngitis this would have lowered the bar for his actual performance and saved some face instead the party did n't say a thing about it until the debate was half over
ronny jackson and speaker of the us house of representatives johnson told everyone biden was going to be juiced and hopped up on energy drinks are they stupid
it 's not that bad settle down you saddle him us let 's ride this out
rapid deterioration from covid watch curb your enthusiasm final season and compare to richard lewis sometimes “ long covid ” is n’t even that long especially if you ’re a fossil he frankly might even not make it to the convention chew on dat it ’ll be a rush job another primary before november assuming they do n’t count super delegate votes at the convention that ’s not a democratic party this is the world and we ’re just watching it but we need to take power take it away from fascists “ on both sides “ especially the bourgeoisie
need to see how it moves state level polling national head to head polling is useless
it takes at least 3 days to get a good poll it is way too early to be drawing results right now
the point was to get undecided voters and soft biden voters to vote for biden he failed
did those polls show movement towards biden or trump though there was a 538 poll that showed biden lost the debate and in terms of the horserace biden is in the lead but did lose support to trump that was a poll that asked viewers before and after the debate about their preferences did the polls you are referring to measure what voters preferred before and after the debate and do they show which direction things moved in or do they just show the current horserace for that matter were those polls even from after the debate
biden lost the debate more than trump won trump acted exactly as he always did and lied the whole time without any resistance we all know what trump is like and no one ever holds him to the things he says during the debate
shocker the beltway got it wrong shocker it did n't move much of anything as expected trump maybe might get a slight bump but it 'll regress in short order the minute we get another gaffe from him soon he did not do good himself period the problem is biden did not do well and he locked off his options long term himself yeah the msm conception of it being rammed in headlines that worries me more if anything too
the democrat doom spiral is being sensationalized by the media nobody i know cares
it was a terrific night for would be authoritarians
dems basically gave gop maga everything they wanted
this is fine they shout as the fire slowly consumes us all
they wo n’t a lot are saying their fears now but that ’s now no one in their group ever spoke tf up before last night unfortunately these politicians have decided they ’re never stepping down keeping gentleman agreements while gop and maga do whatever they want to win
ya it just seems like an excuse the way they did it idk if i believe it honestly
because if you think the extent of biden ’s performance issues was a cold then i have a bridge to sell you
lay off the crack pipe dawg
probably gon na have to wait a week or so for much of that
it also does n’t take into account people that just wo n’t vote
yup and it really blocks off his path in the sun belt imo he needed to advance not slightly water but it 's really coming down to the rust belt save maybe nv he 's in moe on the rcp avg there too
he certainly did fail to do that but it also does n't seem to have been the killing blow biden is doomed forever trump landslide now shit people were dooming about ether
mc showed biden gaining one from pre debate the 538 poll was the ipos poll and it showed a bit of bleed but mostly to kennedy undecided those are people he can hopefully win back trump gained like 2 % overall kind of a wash between them yes the polls were all explictly post debate polls that also asked who do you think won the debate and stuff like that survey usa had n't done a national poll since febuary so impossible to really trend line there
100 % that whole second half was a disaster as trump would put it if anything on his part the problem is first impressions are all many focus on and biden was horrid in the first 20 minutes
i 'll still be enthusiastically voting for biden instead of the narcissistic compulsive liar who has been adjudicated to be a sexual abuser defamer fraudster and felonious election interferer
yes i do not feel axios used the word correctly in their headline
i ’ll circle back and remind you when he ’s being buried
i mean we ’ve been waiting a bit longer for polls to reflect trump ’s felony convictions we might be okay
those dreams of florida georgia nc and virginia are gone he just could n’t step down
nv is so fucking weird somehow you can get like b 2 polls and t 12 polls out of there the state just is consistently unpollable
this was bidens biggest test so far in the campaign given what trump has done and said he should have massacred him and instead he embarrassed himself and gave no reason for undecideds to vote for him and in fact reasons to not vote for him
cool i ’m guessing you were always going to vote for biden no matter the outcome of this debate think you ’re equipped to objectively assess how undecided voters felt about his performance
i suspect you will see it more prominently in the swing states i also think we are going to see exceptionally low turnout in the fall that will favor trump
he 'll hang on to virginia imo but yeah those other three not a chance tbf florida seems gone gone so long as any d is potus it 's almost as bad a situation for dems as texas right now oof
mhm if i were him that 'd be the one i 'd go for and maybe a push reach in az if he wants backup states to reach push there it 's got to be those two due to some remote hope in occasional polls there in moe he 's very likely finished in oh ia tx fl nc what is he doing there i still do n't get it and ga otoh
what do you like best about the narcissistic compulsive liar who has been adjudicated to be a sexual abuser defamer fraudster and felonious election interferer
so call this delusional cope think or whatever i certainly am but i wonder if the old rules of “ low turnout favoring republicans ” still apply i am basing this mostly off of blue swings in special elections and polls showing more engaged voters favoring biden at higher rates but really i have no idea what the best course of action at this point is merely musing out loud
i d still push in nc to help out in the gov race given how insane the r nominee is ia oh fl were never in play and texas was just dems wishcasting though it 's likely to be closer than the 3 i just mentioned
i do n’t like him but polls show him in a competitive position to win the election and i ’m not sure biden is the best candidate to beat him so we need to have an adult conversation about a realistic path forward from the debate
republicans love trump and skeptical ones will be pushed back to the fold by joe ’s meltdown they do n’t like trump but they are not voting for this version of joe biden they ’ll show up can the same be said for low propensity dems
they 're whistling past the graveyard and dragging us along with them i despise trump just look at my comment history lol so i 'll still vote for biden but not everyone will after last night these poor souls are really finding that idea hard to believe for some reason i do n't know if it 's denial or what but i wish they 'd join the rest of us in reality
or hear me out redistricting and money caused a loss here
bowman ’s defeat shows that big money can decide any election would love to see the bowman criticism in a situation where his contender was n’t supplied with a record level of donation money from israeli group aipac weird how easily foreign influencers can decide a single election in america these days
no it shows what happens when you let money run politics bowman was up against think tanks who wanted to destroy him for being against a genocide in israel and they funded his competitor to the tune of 50 million to run attack ads and gain exposure against him they do shit like this to silence people within the party who speak out against these powerful countries orgs individuals
i think you 're confusing aipac spending more money on propaganda in support of his opponent than anyone in the history of congressional campaigns
jew hatred is a really weird word to use for someone who was simply calling out the israeli government for their blatant war crimes backed by the icc
that too but bowman was also not a great candidate especially after the fire alarm stunt he strikes me as the kind of person who would say or do anything to sit at the popular kids ’ table
he won a similar map in 2022 he lost because he did nothing for his constituents fought against the infrastructure law and alienated voters that he previously won
redistricting caused him to lose nearly 50 % of the votes he had in 2020
he was already polling way behind before big money got into the race
he was derelict in his duty he lost hugely because he never talked to any local leaders in his district he was a shit politician but go ahead and blame the jews
he 's a 9 11 truther and denied the rapes committed by hamas on october 7th crazy conspiracy theorists are rightfully hated when they come from the gop why the different standard here
well its not my district but he struck me as a stronger candidate than the alternative in terms of values and policy and quite frankly i do n't care about the fire alarm thing it seems an honest mistake to me
do you understand density the map is always going to be similar geographically but the composition changes drastically with even a small part of the bronx
as a matter of fact yes before after the area that was cut is the bronx that is where bowman 's key support lay without it he could n't win the bronx is a dense area of land while it was relatively small density is what won the day originally
that foreign governments should n't be allowed to buy influence in us elections yes that is what i think
yeah i think my friend from 5th grade tried to say the same he got suspended though
yeah fire alarms that you have seen hundreds of times at your workplace you just accidentally mistake them for the door handle
he won over 50 % of the westchester county vote in 2022 if he won similar amounts he would have won he alienated voters in his district
it 's not like he absorbed a bunch of republican areas the areas around white plains generally went pretty strongly for biden in 2020
aipac is n't a foreign political action committee all the money comes from americans and there are very strict laws for pacs with regards to where they get their money also bowman was down double digits in the polls before aipac spent a dime on this race he was going to lose no matter what
if it happened at my workplace i would n't care either lol it 's a non issue to me but i guess to others it is
while true this primary election was more of a battle between progressive left and moderate left its interesting to me that the monied interests preferred the moderate side of the left than to the progressive
you do n’t care that he committed a crime to disrupt the business of the us congress
i looked all over for video evidence but all i found is the still image i 'm not convinced by that alone and it seems more likely to me as it would be for most people that it was a panic move while in a rush so yeah i guess i m just unconvinced it was a deliberate attempt to disrupt business of congress
if he did do that in order to allow the time required to read the bill then i 'm glad he did it and support the crime better to commit an act of civil disobedience than pass an unread bill every time
jesus fucking christ okay man hope you enjoy your political ideology losing again and again
you know you can actually look it up and read for yourself what was going on with congress when he broke the law being accepting of pulling fire alarms when there is no fire because it if politically convenient makes you an incredibly morally bankrupt person
actually passing a bill without reading it is morally bankrupt and civil disobedience is not
dnc “ at least he ’s not trump ” ok then could n’t you literally pick any democrat age 35 65 if all it takes is a blue candidate the same logic applies where they are n’t trump
the dnc knew this was a problem 2 years ago they put their money on biden anyway they effectively cancelled a primary and threatened to blackball the careers of any challengers they may very well broker a back room deal at the convention for a 11th hour stalking horse replacement candidate completely removing the matter from the hands of their own voters this is what “ defending democracy ” is not letting your own voters decide anything the dnc royally royally screwed the pooch here
why are there so many “ article of an article ” posts floating around now every outlet from cnn to cnbc is just re re examining the same nyt editorial piece why are y’ all just rewording the same article for us 10k times combined with the mysterious influx of “ new ” users on reddit and i ’m starting to think all these conservative voices want biden going e for a reason not to say there are n’t people legitimately concerned about his performance warranted or otherwise but i ’m starting to feel herded in here
i ’d like to know some of the names that the dnc has been floating behind the scenes
the democratic party loves losing winnable elections so they wo n’t put anyone else forth unless biden resigns which he wo n’t
i ’m absolutely disgusted at a rerun of another ruth badar ginsburg we all know how that selfish supreme judge ’s actions turned out and now the democratic party is risking a second trump presidency and the destruction of our country on the very same stupidity
surely this is n't apart of a setup republican tactic i 'm just crazy right this does n't sound like that at all considering they 've been spamming this one article for the 123456 time
he should but unfortunately from everything coming out of the administration he will not biden is going to put trump in office because like many others he is clinging to power
and they do n't call a serial liar felon to do the same
and why they ’re not calling on convicted felon trump to step down as well
two major points first the right wing loves to repeat any article which furthers their agenda second i have never seen so many 3 word hyphenated number user names in comments before
the moment nyt finds the stronger candidate i 'll gladly endorse this line of thinking
the telegraph reports the new york times has called on joe biden to stand down from the presidential race and to a “ stronger candidate ” who would have a better chance of beating donald trump in an article by its editorial board the newspaper accused mr biden of a “ reckless gamble ” by continuing his re election bid after with trump on thursday night at the debate mr biden made factual mistakes and froze in response to moderator questions “ there are democratic leaders better equipped to present clear compelling and energetic alternatives to a second trump presidency ” the new york times said “ there is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between mr trump ’s deficiencies and those of mr biden ” read more
hey i 'm sure the totally level headed nytimes will then endorse the contender with the highest favorability with independents and republicans right his 46 % rating not exactly stratospheric but better than the others is thanks to his strength among democratic voters 78 % paired with his crossover appeal he is the highest rated democrat among independents at 41 % and among the highest rated democrats among republican voters at 18 %
this seems like a perfect line up for a new candidate the right timing the elections are getting closer would have the republicans torpedoed in chaos mode trying to find dirt on the new candidate would show democrats actually listen to their potential voters a younger candidate can make trump the old one and solves the i 'd vote for anyone else but the current two issue
it is still early enough to make the move and win biden served his purpose which was to beat trump in 2020
i ’ve been calling on joe biden and kamala to step down ever since 2022 i did it before it was cool
i hate trump i do n't want biden talking to leaders of other nations and representing my country he has shown he is incapable he needs to be replaced
just because president biden did n't do well at the debate does n't mean he has n't done a good job running the country for the last four years we 're not replacing him he is our candidate and even if we wanted to replace him which we do n't it 's too late it 's only four months until the election
i ’m already sick of these articles
or they could choose bernie who polls better with independents than any other democrat from what i can see
i just read this axios sample poll that small sample but if it ’s being considered seriously by the dnc which it should be it ’s got to happen now
this is just it its a massive display of the hypocrisy that lives in the democratic party they do so much in the name of defending democracy yet they do so much to take things out of the hands of their supporters they did it with bernie in 2016 and 2020 and they continue you to do it it 's absurd and we should n't stand for it anymore
they knew in 2020 many did anyway
the dnc had nothing to do with it it was biden 's choice and no one challenged him your conspiracies are fantastical biden is the candidate end of
back in 2022 we had polling showing that bernie still polled the best with independents and republicans of any contender his 46 % rating not exactly stratospheric but better than the others is thanks to his strength among democratic voters 78 % paired with his crossover appeal he is the highest rated democrat among independents at 41 % and among the highest rated democrats among republican voters at 18 % if biden had n't limped into this debate and instead let an open primary take place the democrats would once again have to explain why a crossover appealing democrat with no cognitive issues ca n't have the nomination and with corporate greed and inflation bernie 's arguments would only be stronger in a way this is shaping up to be a 3rd time the dnc did n't give bernie a fair shake
here is the part most people do n't actually understand a party does n't want to stay in power for too long or else people will start demanding that you deliver on your promises the party in power will eventually have to engineer a strategic loss to preserve their own survival and plan for their eventual return to power in the next election by blaming the other party who was in power both party will compete with each other but will work together when you create an existential crisis for the system i do n't think trump is a good guy or for the people but he definitely went into business for himself and is trying to help the gop survive which explains the uncharacteristically aggressive attacks he receives from the uniparty he definitely bucked the established tradition of rule by collective he is like caesar maybe he will be the catalyst of the unparty being destroyed from within due to infighting
journalists reporting on other journalists has become increasingly problematic over the past decade it 's lazy journalism similar to react channels on youtube or twitch
the right wing papers will repeat anything any other paper says which services their goal the telegraph would n't repeat the ny times if the times said trump should withdraw
in no particular order kamala harris gavin newsom michelle obama gretchen whitmer roy cooper andy beshear and maybe abigail spanberger
there is a very real possibility the biden may lose the presidential election but and forgive my ignorance have n't the democrats been winning the majority of elections special and otherwise since 2018
i will vote for joe biden ’s corpse if they roll it out everyone in this country can fuck right off trump is such a loser i would vote for a literal turd before i would vote for the felon fucking loser
it 's from their editorial section right does n't that lean conservative with which to begin
it 's worth mentioning that it is publicly known that the nyt has been writing hit pieces on the biden campaign because he wo n't grant them an interview the nyt also knows their subscriber base goes up if trump is elected every media outlet is expecting at least a short term gain if trump is elected
the ny times has douthat stephens and brooks as opinion writers these three are varying degrees of right wing hacks the times sees both sides as always equal and so they are now always balanced at the expense of fairness and honesty
last polling i saw on sanders showed he still polled the best with independents and among the best with republicans i 'll give you 1 million to 1 odds the new york times leaves that out of their analysis any takers
do you not see how this is essentially paradoxical no one is going to come forward unless biden steps down he needs to step down because it 's the only thing that will allow someone else to take his place otherwise he 'll remain the nominee and there will be no chance for anyone else to come forward
those are not exactly great numbers obama was about 80 93 % among dems at the end of his first term and 41 53 % among independents i agree other candidates do n't poll great head to head either but the generic democrat polls very well versus republicans way higher than biden we would n't really know the true numbers of other candidates until they became the nominee and got full name recognition funding and national attention over a period of time
yeah just a reminder that kamala harris was 17th place in the 2020 democratic primaries with a measly 844 popular vote from california
ok then i 'm not voting for him
' independents ' means progressives just like him bernie is not gon na win swing voters
people are still doing this
i ’m a lifelong democrat and within 5 minutes of the debate i was scared shitless knowing once again that biden is incapable and the dems had effed up once more inexcusable when so much is at stake
for those interested the appears to have been conducted by morning consult axios included a few other findings from the poll of democratic voters 21 % say biden should definitely not be replaced and 20 % say probably not when the survey asked respondents to choose between biden and former president trump 45 % chose the president and 44 % chose the former commander in chief still most respondents 57 % of those who viewed the debate said trump outperformed biden that includes 19 % of democrats 60 % of independents and 93 % of republicans
i do n't think we 'll know what they are going to do or not do until more national polls drop in about a week if he tanks you have to think they make a move the issue will be kamala she 's obviously next in line and i actually like her but what has she done to get handed the nomination she will have to go along with any change in plans
small sample no it is not
so what is the message a replacement candidate runs on it ’s not “ defending democracy ” at that point because they would have lost that message with the 33 000 voters in the handful of counties that actually decided this thing i do n’t know how the democrats dig themselves out of this hole i ca n’t envision any scenario that turns out remotely well
bernie is not a democrat he is owed nothing
the democratic party will never be the party of bernie sanders and democratic socialism it does n't agree with sanders ' policies nor his vision for america remember how they argued for public option no one in the party has brought it up since biden won the nomination in 2020
michelle obama should not even be an option she hated being in the white house and i would n’t wish that scrutiny upon on her
newsom is probably the best bet 1 someone under fucking 60 2 someone who is a strong orator debates well and can stand up to bullies 3 someone who can raise money 4 someone who has a seat attractive enough for kamala to step aside for whitmer is probably the best vp candidate 1 someone under fucking 60 2 from a midwest swing state 3 solid track record 4 will be a strong candidate in 2032
hard to believe bernie is n't on there when the last polling i saw on him showed he still polled the best with independents and among the best with republicans oh republicans want to say he is too old cool the debates with trump will settle that
those are certainly fantastic persons to be president of the united states but are they viable candidates the election hinges on low information undecided voters if they see a ballot with trump against someone they never heard of they are going to go for the devil they know
yes but you ’ve got to win the right elections and win the numbers you need in any election picking up a few seats here and there ca n’t get anything done love or hate the gop they got laser focused on one thing controlling the judiciary and they played that long game like a finely tuned instrument it takes a generation to build up that kind of network
it 's more complex than that 2018 was the best dem year since 2008 period 40 house seats flipped and some close races in states that the anti trump mood made competitive at the time obviously for the gov sen races 2020 was worse since dems lost house seats but better than 2016 generally speaking however the senate gains were nice in contrast to 2018 2022 was better than your usual midterm for the party in power but dems lost even more house seats hence it flipped red and a lot of lunatics got re elected especially those two madmen in fl and tx so i do n't see it in anyway as a w like many do that sums it up really
i should have been more direct so my apologies for the confusion on that end i had thought given the context of presidential elections it was clear that i had meant that
a lot of people feel the way you do the nyt does n't see a story there
most of the current nyts leans heavily republican they used to be left ish till they sold out and the new ceo sold writing slots now everything is a shit show over their i ca n't remember when 2107 i think is when they really changed
it 's also been floated that the owners are scared that if they are too critical and trump wins it could get bad no shit so basically they are cowed and they make more money
then name me who should take his place or rather who you would have replace him
not a paradox where 's the contradiction maybe a prisoner 's dilemma
no one is going to come forward unless biden steps down the problem is not finding a proper candidate though the problem is to find a proper candidate who has better chances at winning
to be clear i am not endorsing biden as the best option i 'm saying that he 's all you got right now and if anyone wants to talk about how he should step down they should point out who should take his place otherwise it 's them talking out of their ass
obama won his 2nd term by margins nobody seriously thinks any dem can do this cycle so not a totally fair comparison if democrats were gon na run bernie this would be a better cycle to try him than the last 2 roe and jan 6 have made it much less likely he leads to outflow in the party than previous cycles while presumably he could charm the younger generation into higher turnout as the older generations tend to have more stable less variable turnout
you were n't going to were you
no women you care about because that 's cold voting to deny their rights
republicans are n't concerned about trump 's age after the debate they would be after bernie destroyed him in a debate watch his town hall he did in wisconsin yesterday he has n't lost a step and there is no reason to assume he is n't still the candidate with the most crossover and independent appeal ultimately performance matters more than a number let republicans attack his age it will only make the next debate more embarrassing for them
so the polls are wrong and they somehow consistently oversampled the wrong independents bold argument got a source for it
81 % of dems think that biden won the debate that 's actually nuts lol
haha ca n’t the same be said about republicans this is trump ’s third time running despite having so much unwanted baggage
out of curiosity for someone unfamiliar would you mind clarifying what the 33 000 voters you 're referring to
he is constantly doing rallys for biden in swing states and working to get out the vote he finished 2nd in the last dem primary why should a contender who did n't even run or get any votes leapfrog the 2nd place candidate that does n't feel very democratic
that 's true in a way it would be a genius move to out of nowhere pull a 180 at the convention though with the senate and house being so close the corporate lobbyists do n't have to worry too much about bernie and trump is such a threat to us hegemony it would be much like fdr where the corporations somewhat tolerated him as the alternative was defeat
i got a fundraising text from gavin today asking to donate to the dnc every other one i ’ve gotten until last night has been soliciting donations to biden specifically i found that interesting
i say again as i 've said on other subs newsom is a bad choice the nation will not vote for a democrat from california for president newsom could be vp but the rust belt is n't going to vote for a west coast elite however incorrect it may be
from what i have read the money that has been risen for the biden campaign can not be transfered to newsom if he did step aside it can only go to harris and you would need to get her to step aside i doubt that
bernie is a self described socialist running him would be even worse than running biden
i m speaking purely from an anecdotal perspective but of every name you picked i would most welcome bernie and i am definitely a centrist swing voter
bernie got us into this mess with his vanity run in 2016 and 2020
bernie will not win independents even if he were to have moderated at least some of his view points which there appears to be no indication that he has he would not be able to shake that extreme image that follows him he ’s had no major legislation passed that he authored in his 50 years in congress and he ’s still not offered any valid explanation or math behind how he would fund “ medicare for all ” nor how such a program would remain financially solvent over the long term bernie will not win independents with those blind spots
i agree that winning the right elections is certainly important but while the democrats ca n't win all the elections they appear to have been outperforming in elections since 2018 at least i thought they did if that is the case would n't that be winning winnable elections and of course you 're right the gop certainly has been laser focused on the judiciary but it seems like so has the democratic party since biden had one supreme court justice confirmed and so far has had though less than trump 's 234
they 're always strategic cold and detached playing numbers numbers numbers games dems fall in love reps fall in line is a tale as old as time
ah thanks for the clarification if you do n't mind a few more questions were there house seats in 2020 and 2022 that were considered winnable by democrats but were lost were the losses entirely the democrats ' fault or were there additional or perhaps overriding factors that contributed or caused the losses with the context of the house seat losses is the op 's assessment of democrats loving to lose elections proper
jerry mander had something to do with the house losses
ah thanks for the clarification in that case was it the 2016 election that you were thinking of
remember the judith miller scandal
fuck i thought they had our contained mostly to the opinions section politico just got bought out semi recently too i recall the usa today before that then sinclair had gobbled up the nightly news across vast swaths of the states the am capture by the right happened before a third of the people voting was even alive i just realised how much publicity the murdoch empire gets and as a result deflects from so many others engaged in similar pursuits albeit more circumspectly
pete buttigieg gretchen whitmer jon ossoff cory booker anyone essentially
personally pete buttigieg people vote on enthusiasm and no one is enthusiastic about biden
you think biden is the best person for the presidency right now lol
buttigieg warren newsom khanna practically any democrat will be better
resign and endorse kamala anything else will divide the party she has better name recognition than anyone else she has a mandate as she was literally elected to be the backup if necessary it 's now necessary
how about jill biden then you wo n't have to worry about people not recognizing the last name on the ballot
it 's the most recent comparison we have for a democrat i do n't think clinton would give any better comparisons either obama thankfully ended up with a great result personally but it was hard earned he faced a recession in his first term a contentious fight over the aca an emerging tea party and it ended up being one of the worst down ballot congressional losses for democrats in history he also had some tough moments including a bad debate i dunno about bernie he has relatively good favorability right now at least compared to biden but like i said he has name recognition and national attention from having run in the past two cycles hard to compare that to whitmer or someone who we have n't had in that position yet
dementia is a disease not a right
bernie failed in 2016 and failed in 2020 this time is diffrent
funny how dem voters tend to listen to what they say instead of basing their opinion on feelings biden definitely was not strong at the debate but trump was a raving lunatic with 0 substance and did n’t answer any questions
i would n't say either of them won it trump did not say one thing of substance in the entire debate he ranted off topic nonsense that was mostly trying to justify his first poor term biden was terrible but at least he got a few relevant points off and stayed on the topic it would be hard for me to claim either of them actually won the debate but i would say the debate helped trump more since his base does nt ' really care what he says
that ’s not the problem any replacement candidate has to find the message that resonates with voters so far it ’s been “ defending democracy ” if biden is replaced in a deal that takes a crap all over the democratic process then you not only lose a candidate you lose a message too a double blow a mere handful of weeks before early voting starts
sorry it was actually 44 000 but this article explains it
i got the same text i wonder what is happening behind closed doors
because gavin newsome would have such a hard time raising money
and yet he polls better with independents than biden do you really think democrats are gon na get red baited into voting for trump because of the scary socialism word maybe in 2016 but not after jan 6 and roe bernie can get younger voters to turnout they have the most variable turnout if you 've got polling saying he will cause older democrats to switch to republican i have n't seen it especially post roe
had bernie not done more campaign events for hrc in the rust belt than she did herself i am assuming she would have lost by even more i remember when he told the country that nobody should care about hrc 's emails and should focus instead on trump and when he did countless virtual campaigning for biden in 2020 while being gracious enough to call him his friend despite bidens long record of helping republicans pass some of the worst policies of my lifetime from the iraq war to reagan trickle down to de regulating the banks some democrats do n't realize how much sanders does to help normalize a party that seems far more interested in siding with republicans than stopping them all because he believes they can change instead i 'm sure you 'll go back to calling it moderate ' to block popular reforms the next time democrats have a trifecta yet we keep helping you get one just on the off chance you 'll decide to stand up to the republican party
ohohohoh bernie got us into this mess by daring to run in the primary election how dare he
bernie will not win independents but that 's not what the polling shows he is the highest rated democrat among independents at 41 % and among the highest rated democrats among republican voters at 18 % moving on and he ’s still not offered any valid explanation or math behind how he would fund “ medicare for all ” nor how such a program would remain financially solvent over the long term medicare currently gets better prices for every hospital procedure than private insurance every single one if we lowered the medicare eligibility age something that polls as a moderate policy and was supported by both hrc and biden the science says we would save lives and lower inflation the notion that the government doing more of what every other country has done to lower healthcare inflation is radical seems far fetched he would not be able to shake that extreme image that follows him bernie is far more moderate on healthcare than folks like joe manchin who blocked a drug pricing reform supported by 90 % of the country either republicans are a threat to democracy and it is extreme to side with them or republicans are a center right party and it is moderate to side with them democrats need to decide if they want to continue to normalize the republican party by calling it moderate ' to help them pillage this country or stand up to them and call it moderate to pass popular inflation lowering reforms
they 've been playing this game let the dems have the white college ed women we 'll supplant it with a multiracial working class coalition there are more poorly educated people out there than well educated basically so they went with that strategy also isolate dems to the coasts largely therefore making it harder to win the senate this strategy has its cons though reps bleeding any women even if naturally gop affinity in white women is n't good when women are still a majority of the population and white voters are a majority of the us but the pros outweigh the cons from their pov
not really democratic gerrymandering actually reduced the losses remember the dems would have held the house if they did just 1 % better but the dems also lost the house popular vote by like 3 % so the dems actually had the advantage in 2022 of gerrymandering
sanders polls better with independents than all of those choices
thank you that 's what i 'm talking about not that biden is right for the job or that he 's the man or whatever but he is what you got if you want him to step down you got ta have a replacement in mind otherwise it 's just empty talk
sanders polls better with independents and republicans also more proven to motivate younger voters than pete young voter turnout fluctuates a lot it is critical to get a good turnout in 2024 while we can count on older democrats to turn out either way after how extreme trump has become even since 2020
kamala fares worse in head to heads with trump than sanders sanders also finished 2nd in the last real primary while kamala did quite poorly
bernie failed in 2016 and failed in 2020 he got 2nd in both of those you are n't suggesting the dnc nominate someone behind closed doors who failed even worse than bernie or who did n't even run and is untested in national politics are you someone who polls worse with independents and republicans is that really your suggestion
bernie will win over black voters again in 2024 in his 3rd national primary immediately after the last two for sure s
he did n't fail as much as he was torpedo'd by the dnc
yeah trump had a chance to just be a normal human being and he could have really made greater gains but he lied so much and would n't answer questions instead trying to score cheap points totally unnecessary after biden botched his initial comments just take the w and be chill and presidential trump actually blew it even if he still won as he could have really changed his perception based on how weak biden was
dude i watched the whole thing joe biden very clearly forgot what he was talking about more than once mid statement several times he mumbled out what he was saying in a way that was actually unintelligible i 'm still voting for the guy but if you think that performance was n't terrible and extremely telling of his current state i think you 're lying to yourself i get it obviously any person the democrats put up will be better than trump but this looks bad
you are acting like upholding democracy is something that should n’t be respected in terms of foreign policy biden seems more trusted and respected in terms of economic policy nobel prize winners unanimously decided biden ’s policies are better at wrestling with inflation biden ’s job growth crushes trump ’s job downfall covid played a role so some slack here in terms of social issues biden wants to overturn roe v wade trump seems to take great pride in that overturning and that 20 yr set back in women ’s rights in terms of just not being a scumbag trump is a convicted felon and commited infidelity also he seems to be really well liked by the kkk so yeah there are a lot of things that biden seems to be better than trump as a president even if up keeping democracy is not a hot button topic for you
ah now i understand it 's the total number of voters in key states that formed the electoral college win i appreciate the clarification
citing a poll from 2 years ago with nothing really on the line stop using internet explorer dude new race new dump truck of issues
according to polling of the general electorate sanders does worse vs trump than biden does makes your poll of independents questionable perhaps that is picking up more on leftists rather than the centrist swing voters who decide elections and socialism has gotten even more after january 6 and dobbs vs in 2019 only 36 % like socialism and 60 % oppose it do you really think democrats are gon na get red baited into voting for trump because of the scary socialism word us democrats would pinch our noses and reluctantly vote blue it 's the swing voters in the middle who would elect trump because socialism is evil bernie can get younger voters to turnout he did n't do it in 2016 and in 2020 he did worse than in 2016 in literally every state so that 's extremely doubtful if you 've got polling saying he will cause older democrats to switch to republican i have n't seen it again it 's not about democrats it 's about the swing voters where sanders does worse than biden vs trump
the young voter joke again he could n't get them to turn out in 2016 or 2020 sure as hell ca n't do it in 2024
by staying in the primaries long after the math made it impossible for bernie to win by continuing to launch negative ads against hillary who should have been the presumptive nominee at that point hillary was getting hammered by both bernie and trump for months why fuck bernie in every sense of the word fuck him because he 's a big part of the reason we have trump
the congressional budget office ran the numbers medicare for all would cost over 32 trillion dollars in 2022 dollars that ’s our entire national debt presently minus a few trillion dollars but who ’s counting right the math is not mathing my guy
no 80 year olds man
kamala fares worse in head to heads with trump than sanders eh when people take these types of polls they 're always doing so with the current status quo in mind even if asked not to it 's hard not to so they 're seeing kamala in the context of biden still being an option but if biden 's not an option and they do a big pr push for kamala i could see kamala 's chances improving
obama was untested and won his resume prior to 2008 was really weak he was considered inexperienced and us senate in a blue state he only had 2 years of us senate experience when he ran for president
wait so you think black voters in swing states would leave the dem party and vote for trump if bernie was the nominee got a source for that seems highly dubious bernie won black voters in iowa and nevada he did well with young black voters whose turnout is most likely to fluctuate over consistent older voters unless you think older black voters prefer trump to bernie to win the general he needs to win independents and some republicans in swing states and polls show he is uniquely popular with those 2 combined groups
yes and it ’s only going to get worse this type of deterioration does n’t get better unfortunately
however terrible biden ’s “ performance ” was his actual words had far more substance than trump ’s
in case you missed it there was a debate the other night long story short it did n’t go well for biden and that ’s attempting to put it kindly i do n’t care if joe is the most decorated american in history i do n’t care if he was on the boat helping washington cross the delaware i do n’t care if he was jd power ’s automobile of the year last year i do n’t care if he stayed at a holiday inn express or saved 15 % on his car insurance by switching to geico he has a serious serious problem right now and because democracy is that important the democrats have to very quickly un f ’ themselves because the biden that showed up to that debate ai n’t winning no election in november
correct those counties in those states are the “ jump balls ” in this race
that 's a poll of 2024 contenders done before we knew if biden was gon na run again in 2022 if you have any newer poll showing bernie 's number with independents which has been consistently high for years has changed i 'd love to see it i ca n't help it if he has n't been polled since 2022 it is still decent data considering he has n't changed much since then
sanders does worse vs trump than biden does after last night 's debate we should be comparing sanders to kamala not biden right realclearpolling averages show that limited surveys suggest that harris has an even bigger disadvantage than biden if she were to run against trump the former president leads harris by 6 6 percentage points with 49 3 percent support to the democrat 's 42 7 percent rcp averages show trump ahead of biden by just 1 5 points with 46 6 percent to the president 's 45 1 percent those polls represent worse results for kamala than your bernie trump polls and a greater difference between biden and kamala than biden and bernie the presumption among many democrats is biden should n't run because he has some type of health problem like dementia this was not the case as much in 2022 if you 've got recent polling showing kamala doing better in head to heads than bernie please share
circle found he set records for young voter turnout in both 2016 and 2020 that does n't mean he won the primary but it does mean we can expect the group with the most variable turnout to show up for him you 'd have to argue that older lean dem voters would switch to trump to make your case but considering biden 's terrible debate performance is unlikely to cause them to switch it seems unlikely they would draw the line at a cognizant bernie over a not so cognizant biden those voters are n't trading away their rights so easily anymore
young voters this go around are even weirder because more of them are leaning republican it ’s not a majority by any means but could be enough to mess with mess up some historic trends gen z has had education defined by virtual learning thanks covid and i ’m not sure all of them fully grasp the gravity of cultural and historical issues like roe v wade and the subsequent dobbs decision they also have significant economic grievances and busted promises on student loans that fall on biden that voting block can be sliced and parsed all day but they ’re sure as shit not voting for bernie if they even choose to vote at all
if we do nothing did n't they find we will spend more than 40 trillion dollars let me get this straight you are defending the world 's highest healthcare inflation and calling it moderate to block the expansion of a program proven to get lower prices for healthcare what is it about wanting more inflation so global healthcare corporations can have record profits that you find so moderate is it moderate to want lower inflation or higher inflation
they could be 1000 if they are healthy and have n't lost a step and appeal the best to independents and young voters they are the right person for the job
obama won a primary if they are gon na replace biden why would they pick someone who got 15th place or whatever over 2nd
right i really do n't see how biden is gon na hold up the guy is one fall away from the 25th there is no way he makes it through another 4 years we 're voting for a delayed harris presidency to be honest but if he dies before the election trump will win harris will not beat trump in a national election biden should take a step back and the dems should run newsom with bidens full support we could actually win that election and with a person who knows what day it is
i hate this timeline yeah he did n't start off well but when he spoke he dropped facts and numbers and truth we 've all known he stutters and takes a moment to collect his thoughts there 's nothing wrong with that i agree he 's old we can deal with that after the election trump did come off strong in the beginning but as usual he deteriorates into straight up lies the sad thing is he can say anything and people will suck it up and believe him i do n't know what biden 's deal was last night but i 'm hoping it was just a bad night because of nerves or a cold or exhaustion or whatever if you paid attention he did drop facts and numbers unfortunately in this day and age so many people are uneducated and ca n't comprehend these things that 's an argument for another time let 's hope the next round he 's on his a game he seemed alright today which indicates to me he will do better next time honestly the debates closer to the election are the most important because of a lot of peoples attention span these days
whoa that 's a new phrase to me jump balls
it ’s worse i promise i ’m an independent voter top issues are inflation economy immigration and the conflicts in ukraine gaza in that order female reproductive rights is 4th bernie has no major authored and passed legislative solutions on any and spending 32 trillion to save 6 8 trillion over 20 years wo n’t fix grocery prices right now higher wage higher skill jobs will make the blow not suck as bad bernie has got nothing for that
harris on the other hand is n't a self described socialist and also would n't have the age issue that bernie and biden have so it seems safe to assume she 'd have more room for upward growth than bernie and less room to be attacked and fall even further
that voting block can be sliced and parsed all day but they ’re sure as shit not voting for bernie if they even choose to vote at all it is odd to think after bernie set turnout records with young voters in 2016 and 2020 they would n't find him more appealing than biden or other candidates a year of virtual learning did n't seem to dampen his numbers much by 2022 based on this article i 'll admit i do n't have much more recent stuff but sanders seems to be a little more forceful on gaza which polling indicates would benefit him with younger voters since 2022
if you ’re gon na spend the equivalent of your entire nation ’s debt on anything it better make electricity dam up water to prevent devastating flooding make food clean up roads and ditches insure the money supply and build bombs that win wars even fdr knew that
obama declared for presidential candidacy feb 2007 that was his first presidential and never made it to the primaries prior to 2007 obama did n't win the primary until 2008 so by your own logic you would 've never voted for obama in the primaries because he was considered untested
and spending 32 trillion to save 6 8 trillion over 20 years wo n’t fix grocery prices right now any reforms however moderate to healthcare will actually help reduce inflation like gas and oil when healthcare costs go up pretty much everything goes up wages have to go up goods that require workers have to go up the government ca n't do much directly to lower inflation except every other country has directly lowered healthcare inflation more than we have over the last few decades when manchin blocked stronger prescription drug price reforms he made inflation worse for america arguing we should n't bother to even try to lower inflation in the one sector where governments typically act to lower inflation seems odd during an inflationary crises
and yet hrc had those same strengths and that assumption proved wrong as just like kamala she consistently underperformed bernie in head 2 heads socialist how effective is red baiting when abortion rights are on the line what matters now is getting more people to the polls the current polling looks at likely voters older voters tend to vote at consistent rates younger voters vary more from election to election you are arguing the candidate with more room to grow is the one who does worse with the demo that has the most room to grow
the only two peer reviewed medical articles on the issue in the last 30 years came to the same conclusion medicare for all will save money by removing unnecessary paperwork and insurance company profits lowering drug costs and other factors multiple studies also shows it saves lives biden said he supported a public option if public healthcare costs more than private healthcare as you are pretending why did biden support a public option your reasoning makes no sense should biden apologize for supporting a public option since according to you publicly administered healthcare is worse than private
no by my own logic if obama had a stroke the day before the convention i would have recommended they nominate hrc instead of a random governor or a candidate that placed 15th in the primary
it ’s clear that you like bernie if you like him that much show up to chicago in august to plead your case at the convention and if they do n’t want to listen you are more than welcome to write his name in on your own ballot in november the rest of the folks that actually want a shot at beating trump have to attempt to find a solution that has a shot at working
hrc would have won in a landslide if it were n't for the emails so that 's a weird thing to bring up is there some legal scandal harris has that i have n't heard about and abortion rights were n't even enough to let the dems win the house in 2022 do n't see how it would suddenly be more effective with a socialist and again young people do n't vote they sufficiently come out to vote for bernie in 2016 and they did even worse in that regard in 2020 for him so the idea that he has strengths with them just seems unfounded and older voters who otherwise could vote for a democrat could be scared into voting r that 's a big part of the worry here again 60 % of the country disapproves of socialism the suburban middle class homeowner who has shifted from the gop to the dems over the past couple decades could be pushed right back to where they started
feels like an accurate take
wisconsin arizona pennsylvania nevada michigan ohio what do they have in common the democrat candidate for senator currently maintains a consistent lead in polls and trump maintains a consistent lead over biden these are not different polls within states these are polls conducted polling the same voters at the same time joe biden is trailing behind democrat senate candidates by around 6 9 percent and that is despite the fact he is running against trump this is not a result of last night it is a true constant in polling over the past year obviously in the next two weeks these numbers are going to get even worse i am kind of shook reading this sub i was hoping that last night even the most stubborn holdouts had seen the reality biden will not win re election barring some sort of legitimate miracle no it is not acceptable or understandable to be hopeful about the situation that is the same complacency and burying of collective heads in the sand that got us here if you do n’t want trump to be president do not try to convince yourselves in echo chambers please do something about demand the dnc pressures biden give biden money or your adderall canvas and be an activist just do not tell yourself this is going to work itself out on its own because if you do that you ’ll have no one to blame that chilling wednesday in november than yourself i am not sitting here on a high horse pretending to know the answer but i know that not acknowledging how catastrophic the current landscape is plain ignorance sorry for using mark cuban as a way to post but this sub makes it almost impossible
no one cares what mark cuban has to say
mark excellent comments and i agree fully with you
i 'm all in to save democracy to crush trump instead we seem to have a blue maga wave desperate to commit political suicide all the swing states are losing the national popular vote is practically even which is a disaster accounting for republican advantages in gerrymandering electoral college any other democrat gets an instant 7 % to 10 % advantage over biden 's unfavorables this is total insanity why is everyone so stuck to joe biden i do n't care which democrat it is this guy is n't even fit to be president right now this is a slow motion train wreck it reminds me of that speech in band of brothers where everyone refuses to follow that man into combat we 're at the bottom of the barrel folks give just us a democrat that can last 90 minutes it 's disgusting the democratic party led us into this trap remember dianne feinstein how confident is everyone here that biden does n't keel over and die in the last week before the election care to bet democracy on it
i strongly suggest you go look at allan lichtman 's youtube channel he is the guy who has predicted all elections correctly so someone that knows more about it than me you or any redditor his opinion this debate wo nt change a thing the polls do nt mean a thing removing biden would be a guaranteed trump win no matter what he will give his final prediction in late august but as it stands biden is still on the path to victory he explained it all deeply in the stream he did yesterday which you can watch and he is urging everyone to chill out
i mean i ’m not gon na go full doomer yet hilary was pretty widely considered to be winning for the last several weeks until the comey e mail shit popped up in the last week biden and trump are both old sure biden seems to be in worse condition overall but trump is in horrible shape we ’re one mcdonalds fueled heart attack away from a shattered republican party i ’m just gon na take it day by day
new general election poll post debate biden 45 % 1 trump 44 % last poll was a tie morning consult 2000 rv 6 28 biden 's not dropping out
the logistics of a new candidate at this stage would be an absolute nightmare biden was sick and the debate should have been rescheduled i am voting d no matter what but if we roll someone new out this late in the game it ’s an absolute cluster of a process
this guy was one of the few that looked past the bullshit of the “ red wave ” in 2022
this is an interesting argument i have n't really followed the senate races very closely but checking some recent polling data you seem right about the gaps between senate polling vs presidential polling one question for you how much do you think the quality of the senate candidates plays into that i have n't followed them closely enough to know but just eyeballing i see that arizona 's running kari lake who is absolutely batshit my memory from 2020 was that republicans ran a shockingly weak set of senate candidates walker oz and that that was the main factor in their poor performance across multiple races related i think to the republicans going all in on extremist candidates with little to no cross over appeal do you think that 's a factor in the discrepancies here as well or are you seeing specific senate races where the republican candidate should be closer but the gap is still much more significant than in the presidential race
anyone who calls democratic candidates democrat candidates clearly should not be taken seriously
lol bro i think you need to touch some grass
what does gerrymandering have to do with the presidential election
lichtman uses his own algorithm which while has been accurate per se the only election that actually was unpredictable was 2016 gore bush is second but lichtman got the popular vote wrong in that one the electorate bases change every 40 years historically political scientists have n’t really been able to map out this new one because trump is such an anomaly he is no doubt a smart guy so i know he is n’t actually saying polls do n’t matter polls are incredibly accurate historically last two midterm elections cycles have been very callable was a bit of an over correction for the 2016 miscalculation but it ’s pretty well adjusted now again if you want to put your eggs in the basket of someone just cause they predict correctly also look at vegas who has an even better track record and their own algorithms and how bidens odds have been free falling
removing biden would be a guaranteed trump win no matter what there is no evidence of this as you do n't have a history of this occurring anytime recently and barely any history of it at all australia and england however are two of the most similar countries to the us and have plenty of historical evidence that replacing a leader and going to an election with a new face tends to work out better than not when the old leaders popularity starts to become dangerously bad or they have a particularly troubling scandal thise systems are obviously not the same nor the culture but they are the closest you can get to understanding the likely impact
i can live with day by day i just am annoyed at being here and it ’s because of false optimism to begin with i never saw hillary despondent and literally inaudible more goes to show how disliked she is then anything having to do with biden or trump
this is a national poll biden or any democrat will undoubtedly win the popular vote which is what this is measuring that ’s well and good but has nothing to do with winning the presidency 6 states will decide the election and 5 of them are the ones i just listed here with problematic poll numbers i guess i just do n’t get why as a fellow liberal anyone would be hellbent on completely ignoring the reality of the situation i want the same thing and would take biden as president in a heartbeat wanting him to win though has nothing to do with him actually winning
appreciate this as thoughtful discerning semi reluctant to give a truthful answer since this sub thinks i ’m an undercover maga shill based on comments and dms but i ’d say a bit of both in terms of candidate weakness mccormack in pa and hovde in wi are rich carpetbaggers who have n’t ever been able to catch traction similar to oz who coincidentally beat mccormack in his primary sam brown in nevada is a purple heart recipient from an ied explosion in iraq and his wife has been open about her abortion and brown supports right to choose openly as a repub candidate in a 10 person primary sherrod brown has an incumbency advantage over moreno big time and lastly kari lake is indeed a complete nut job michigan is two newcomers so hard to read much there i think to read too much into these individual matchups would be a mistake though of course yes candidate quality is a huge and massively important part of any political race what can be lost though in blaming candidate quality is how biden is n’t even competitive in states like ohio dem sherrod brown leading florida repub rick scott only up around 2 3 points montana dem tester about even in nc with a popular democrat governor roy cooper then those swing states wisconsin michigan nevada pennsylvania arizona all have democratic leadership in terms of federal representation state legislatives a convo for another time so it ’s more than fair to ask why they keep electing dems but are having a hard time with biden lastly and perhaps the scariest biden barely holding a lead in minnesota where klobachar is up by double digits ny new mexico and pretty much any blue state you look at biden is underperforming dems if you look at the whole picture and plurality of races i ’d argue it ’s pretty clear it ’s an epidemic countrywide the one argument other than biden being an unbelievably weak candidate is that trump is an unbelievably strong candidate it quite literally has to be one or the other unfortunately and dishearteningly it ’s clear this massive platform of under 50yo liberals have no interest in admitting either could be the case sorry for the multiple essays but i ’ve read poll numbers every week since i was 12 and it ’s a weird passion even tho it does me no good thanks for reading and contemplation appreciate the open mindedness and not being told i ’m an idiot or a republican for once lol
this is satire i think hope ca n’t tell with this sub but for anyone reading google “ democratic candidates ” and see what pops up haha edit pretty sure you thought you were being clever so democratic is an adjective describing that having to do with democracy democrat is the word that describes people who are in the democratic party
sorry meant electoral college the national vote % is about 5 % off the electoral college outcomes in a generalized sense in 2016 donald trump and mike pence won with 306 electoral votes donald trump and mike pence won in 2016 with 306 electoral votes and 45 9 percent of the popular vote hillary clinton had 48 percent of the popular vote but only earned 232 electoral votes
the only election that actually was unpredictable was 2016 i get your point but it was only unpredictable from a biased standpoint because people like you or me tought trump had no chance his keys model is factual and opinion does nt matter there its not him that predicts the results its the keys so i know he is n’t actually saying polls do n’t matter yes he is repeatedly he does nt see them as anything more than snapshots with small sample sizes idk what he thinks about midterm ones but as for presidential ones he has never taken them into account for the prediction vegas he was asked about that yesterday he just laughed shrugged and said no comment in his final words yesterday polls and debates do nt predict elections the keys do there s still a lot that can happen that can change things both ways
except when a sea change occurs and suddenly polling favor becomes available to the highest bidder i mean if you can buy a judge off the scotus shelf what makes you think you ca n’t buy a poll
i mean biden ’s been doing that since the 60 ’s it not new he ’s consciously fighting a stutter and he ’s old asf
the trouble with day by day is that there are time limits on changing candidates we need our best talent against trump and we have to make that change now i say that as someone who has defended biden up until the debate joe is all sorts of good person but he ’s old and frail and what ’s worse it shows he ’s not going to get better
i like what he said apparently this sub does n't same opinion for once
all true but even trump pointed out the reality of things right now for once
it 's a national poll of 2000 registered voters and basically nothing changed does he still have work to do in certain states and localities yep course he does but he 's not dropping out just because some professional pundits and some weak kneed liberals got wet pants over a fucking debate in june jesus
biden or any democrat will undoubtedly win the popular vote which is what this is measuring undoubtedly
wrong people in the democratic party are democrats people running for office as democrats are democratic candidates only republican dullards call them democrat candidates as an insult to distract from the fact that democrats are actually democratic while republicans hate democracy
no saying democrat candidate instead of the proper democratic candidate is something the moronic right wingers started and now it is specifically used by them disparagingly
cuban is basically spot on also for anyone who wants to witness more insanity go and look at vivek and elons response threads to mark holy fucking shit they are terrible auditions for first in line of the trump human centipede absolute shit eaters
you ’re gon na jesus me look at the poll you ’re citing yourself 48 percent of democrats in it want biden replaced as candidate 78 percent say too old you are living in some kinda alt reality
dems have won 7 of the last 8 dating to 1992 the current electorate with college grads women and minorities solidly dems make it near impossible for a republican to win a majority votes add in donald trump and yeah even biden would still win the popular vote
bud you were the one trying to gotcha me i used the normal political speak i worked in politics for 5 years yes democratic candidate is a valid term but is used maybe 10 20 percent of the time do n’t go throwing rocks if you ’re not equipped to have the convo
it 's always been that way even before the debate nothing new there the problem with the senate equivalency is a national candidate has to appeal to all those states though so it 's difficult to say if you just throw in someone new they wo n't be in the same situation if not worse than biden i also do n't buy the ohio polls entirely since there 's been a dem bias in them consistently in the last several cycles unfortunately i think brown has a better chance than tester to hang on that said
look you can wail about it all you want the only way there 's a new candidate is if biden steps aside and that ai n't happening
again it 's not a valid term it 's only used improperly as an insult by republicans clearly you were working for dirtbag republicans if that 's your take x200b x200b here ya go x200b
this is beyond asinine and the wikipedia article itself recognizes that democrats that ’s me and you do n’t even have a problem with the term as of the early 2000s other than the most partisan democrats this one is just you if you wanna have a discussion or disagree pick something interesting or knit pick at my points do n’t hound me over the usage of common casual political language i ’d think you ’d be more concerned about biden ’s lack of coherency if you ’re this concerned with a single word in a reddit comment
it 's got nothing to do with whether people have a problem with it or not most democrats do n't use that incorrect term most republicans use it as an insult so if you 're actually a democrat do n't help republicans by using their derogatory term more importantly messaging is very important which is why republicans intentionally use that term they do n't want people to associate democrats with being democratic because it has a positive association for most people
just gon na paste my comment to the other reply here guess you must be a part of the real democrat circles from the banner that pops up upon arrival to the dnc website as if url was n’t enough pitch in now to help the dnc ensure we have the resources to elect democrats from local offices to the oval office in november and beyond
if someone asked you your political party affiliation according to you i guess you would say “ i am a member of the democratic party ” and think the 99 percent of normal humans who say “ i ’m a democrat ” are idiots
jeesus christ that is the correct usage we are democrats we elect democrats but our candidates politicians are called democratic candidates politicians
actually they 're both correct usages you can say you 're a member of the democratic party or a democrat you ca n't say that politician is the democrat candidate he 's the democratic candidate
why are people saying it ’s too late part of the reason why biden is not a great candidate other than his age is that he is not someone who encourages turnout literally any other candidate will bring more turnout simply because people will have a reason to vote for something rather than to vote against the other person
it ’s funny that this is being downvoted
a year too late democrats needed a primary
i honestly think that the media calls to drop out will only grow louder and louder and the democrats wishing for his dropping out will only grow in number and become louder and louder because honestly i believe that something is happening under closed doors that was previously unthinkable
if biden drops out we 'll be ready to replace him if he does n't we 'll still vote for him my preference would be that he drops out
if my choice is biden over narcissist rapist fraudster liar insurrectionist national security threat grandpa joe grandpa joe grandpa joe
why did biden display any indication he is a threat to email security compliance
but not the felon put biden 's performance as president against trumps and it 's no contest biden wipes the floor against his giant fat ass trump brings nothing to the table but lies and hate
let ’s be clear the debate did n’t go well for biden but no one in trump world can claim victory either just because he was “ energetic and energized ” does n’t mean he should i run the country again history is littered with “ energetic ” leaders who had no business running the country if the nyt board wants to write that let them kick rocks they ’ve probably had it ready and was waiting for the right time to release it
whatever whatever but it ’s fucking weird y’ all okay with a felon running
exactly why this debate was so early biden ’s handlers have kept him hidden or rigidly scripted so well over the past four years that the public has been shielded from his obvious cognitive decline the whole debate was a total setup now they have time to get another candidate in there before the debate september
how about voters serve their country and vote biden is out after 4 years politics can continue to heal and parties can start to unify and work former president stays in power for life and his children even grandchildren will takeover and no one in the world will be able to stop a democratic norm superpower but from within how did “ voters ” or “ undecided voters ” go from biden is alright from the state of the union to now abandoning a president that is carrying democracy on his “ 81 year old incoherent ” back to live on way after him and still continue to be the democratic country the free world looks towards too even when we have our struggles overblown biden is n’t dropping out defeated the former president only has the record to prove and have the same result with support not turning backs because of the noise from news outlets or random comments on the internet with 5k likes fighting happening around to world to keep democracy alive not just for one country but for the world and voters ca n’t think between the two really the next young generation will ask why did we not vote when democracy was on a ticket you ’re supporting a idea of freedom and free to express and free control of body and the answer will be “ because he was old ”
all this discourse does is help trump win
bravo let ’s hope he listens
the nyt needs to replace their editorial board
biden does n't need to drop out he needs to replace his running mate if he replaces harris with someone energetic and vibrant who can take on trump in the media then his age is going to be less of a concern if biden ca n't perform his duties as president then he 'll resign or have the 25th amendment used to remove him if there is a popular energetic and media savvy liberal vice president there to replace him this becomes a non issue who no clue but it has to be someone who can move the needle
it has been less than 24 hours can we not wait for a single poll before we devolve into total panic
stupid call this ripped the band aid off biden is old and will struggle sometimes and get a bit befuddled especially if not well the pressure is off now he will go up and down but it ’s not a show stopper anymore biden is the only one who can beat trump hopefully the oldies will have empathy for him and get him across the line
i had already canceled my nyt paid subscription earlier this year over nyt ’s normalization of trump seeing that the editorial board responded to cnn giving a bully pulpit to a pathological liar and convicted felon by declaring that biden should end his campaign i unsubscribed from the newsletter too when i got the opinion in email i have also stopped listening to the daily which used to be my favorite podcast because i do n’t want to support nyt anymore i realized i am still subscribed to games so i guess i ’ll have to drop that also it ’s deeply sad as i became a subscriber to the nyt because i thought nyt ’s reporting years ago was absolutely critical to fighting against magaism and investigating trump and generally protecting democracy this is the message the editorial board chooses to send not how deep in danger we are that trump has been allowed to get this back closer to be back in power after everything he ’s done i ’m just depressed it ’s a brutal fall to watch i loved the nyt used to be my primary news source and the voice i trusted the most i ’ve lost all faith even though i know nyt still has some great reporters i just ca n’t be part of this anymore i tried to send this as feedback to nyt but they literally wo n’t let you send feedback unless you ’re a subscriber
biggest story of the day and it has 2 upvotes on this sub lol
they should have put pamela harris michele or cortez on the ballot
this should have happened 18 months ago so damn frustrating
faithfully riding out months of aiding and abetting an ethnic cleansing but getting big red button levels of spooked over a bad debate night is an interesting red line it 's far too late for that at this point but still it 's interesting that that 's what got them active
they are saying that because the primaries are over and the reformed rules for a brokered convention make replacing him with anyone other than kamala harris almost impossible but her nationwide approval numbers stay lower than his to begin with
literally any other candidate will bring more turnout proof
this subreddit along with the democratic party are completely fractured after biden ’s performance
it is so funny how many biden ride or dies are in this sub
under closed doors clearly you 're suffering from age dementia and need to drop out of the presidential race
there is zero chance he drops out none
not sure what you 're even trying to say here are you saying biden did something unthinkable or something happened unthinkable and that 's why biden wo n't step aside confused with your statement
i hope i ’m wrong but i think it ’s too late apparently we need a societal come to jesus meeting such as the world has n’t seen since ww2 the u s does n’t appreciate the diversity of the world and it will be our demise we ’ll be lucky if the world treats us half as nice at the conclusion as the world treated germany religion is n’t the opiate of the masses it ’s the methamphetamine of the masses
i believe that something is happening under closed doors what does this mean
nah people will calm down in a day or two if biden does n't want to drop out no one can force him and it sure looks like he does n't that only leaves one option
well i have to say that i 'm extremely disheartened if there are seriously people that feel this way even sadder still if they believe that a vote for an 80 year old that is showing severe mental deterioration is in any way serving democracy or serving their country this whole thing is a disgrace and with undermine democracy not uphold it they can no longer even uphold the illusion of officials being elected based on merit its corruption pay to play and a divisive strategy that has brought us to the point where tribalism wealth and propaganda now win elections not serving the public
that 's kind of the point of the editorial that does n't and should n't have to be the choice
what about if your choice is a younger dem who can form sentences versus trump
do n't forget twice impeached convicted felon who got caught stealing money from a damn charity or did everyone just forget about that last bit
this is so cringy hope you enjoy the downfall of this democracy by sticking your head in the sand
trump world absolutely can claim victory what are you talking about his team probably spent the whole day replaying the clips while laughing their asses off what do you think the vibe was today in biden ’s camp
dude it felt like i was watching someone smack around a drooling old man in a wheelchair it was terrible to watch i felt big second hand embarrassment watching joe out there
trump did have a good point that other leaders respect joe less trump simply having his witts about him will be the difference between wars happening or not
if biden were polling 20 or 30 points ahead of trump no one would be talking about him dropping out the main reason why the nyt wants biden to move aside is because the anti trump energy is n't guaranteed to grant biden a victory like it had in 2020
i love how people on this sub go with “ if you criticize dear leader biden you support trump ” you almost sound like a trump supporter
nobody is actually falling for that partisan talking point and the polls are clear on that
he basically got convicted on an accounting discrepancy it 's not like trump actually harmed anyone in the process
so well it was obvious to anyone paying attention instead on here if you brought it up it would get downvoted to hell and branded as a republican conspiracy theorist if you were shocked at biden ’s performance last night then you ’ve been willfully ignorant
this discourse is happening because of biden 's actions
last night was a horror show if you watched that and did anything but gasp i want your level of denial
did n't you hear the sky is falling meanwhile make sure not to pay attention to the supreme court selling anything and everything to the highest bidder it was bad before now they are n't even pretending
it ’s not a poll which will be released tomorrow that is the problem it ’s now the fact biden ’s age and cognitive capability will be the major issue in the campaign the media will not relent or give up they ’ll hound the biden campaign til election day with questions and the more americans hear of it the more they ’ll be reminded joe is very very old if even the nyt the bastion of democratic thought has made a decision to call for biden to drop out means the rest of the media will follow suit and continue to press the democrats if he does n’t the only way for the democrats to change that is to get a new candidate
they did the same exact thing to hillary as well article after article shitting on her not her age but constantly focused on the fbi inquiry that really was n't an inquiry and very much over hyped it wash rinse and repeat i imagine a trump presidency drives up their subscriber numbers
dude you think the nytimes is the problem lol
you ’re so brave oh my god how do you do it
what some idiots on a newspaper 's editorial board think is not as big a story as you think
you 're thinking of the newsroom this is the editorial board they are separate editorial board directives carry a lot more weight
according to realclearpolling trump leads harris by 6 6 % she 's less popular than the president right now
they can just change the rules i do n’t get why people do n’t understand this
this is only true if biden does n't step down as the nominee i think if other influential democrats align behind a different candidate it would be pretty indefensible for him to not step down
astroturfing do n't forget that all parties are spending millions of shaping the public opinion online mods and trusted accounts are dirt cheap
that old bastion of conservatism the ny times is telling him to gtfo
seeing lots of bot accusations against anything short of gaslighting about what happened last night
they are coming in hard because they are desperate we need to push back on the astroturfing and gaslighting because we need a candidate that can win
i ’ve been saying it on reddit for months biden should drop out and let someone else take over biden is going to lose to trump and dems will be dumbfounded on how it happened lol
what happens if he drops dead before election day do we just run fucking corpse
he does n't have to they can nominate someone else in a couple of months biden became his party ’s presumptive nominee when he won enough delegates in georgia that pushed biden ’s count past 1 968 for a majority of delegates to the democratic national convention in chicago this august where his nomination will be made official
no i meant that the previously unthinkable getting biden to drop out could occur
i do n't think it 's too late against anyone but trump sure but look at trump 's performance last night it was terrible he could n't answer a single question imagine if rando democrat was in a debate with trump and he goes off on russia russia russia or how about how when asked if he would step down if he lost one of his answers was about how putin was great if anyone but joe biden was up there trump would have been the ultimate loser last night however it would have to come from biden himself is it too late to convince joe biden to step down maybe
did the us invade europe or something
i just wish that everything would stop i just want this madness to all end i just wish that people were n’t so hopeless hell as an eternal optimist this depresses me i hate this i really do
we still got the bombs though
like when you get your foot stuck under the door because you opened it too fast but now it 's stuck and it hurts and you ca n't move it because it hurts to move and your foot is swelling and growing more stuck by the moment and every attempt to move just causes you to yell in pain until you pass out and eventually the door consumes you whole into the door dimension where everything is happening under the door and it 's horrible
being elected based on merit this was never the point the presidency is n't an award that you get for some achievement we 're electing the people who will shape our future
a dead corpse has more merit than trump there 's no moral conundrum in voting for biden anyway its being seriously amplified because the media need drama to sell you 'd swear he forgot his own name or something he just lost his train of thought without the aid of notes trump does n't even try to remember specifics he just invents a fantasy on the fly clever really you ca n't get caught out trying to retain facts when you never learn them in the first place
people forget a lot of things here ’s some more reminders trump 1 lost the election and lied about it 2 sent an armed angry mob to congress and told them they need to fight like hell 3 approved of the mob saying “ hang mike pence ” 4 was found liable for sexual assault 5 was found guilty of defrauding his university students 6 was found guilty of inflating his assets to get favorable loans 7 admitted to walking in on pageant contestants dressing rooms 8 raped and beat ivana trump 9 stole from a kids ’s cancer charity 10 received 413 million inheritance despite claims that he ’s a self made man 11 blocked his chronically ill infant nephew from getting any of that inheritance 12 is the first president to receive votes against him from his own party during impeachment 13 led us into being one of the worst hit during covid despite our head start and resources 14 said the democrats do better with the economy 15 was ranked as the worst president in history by presidential historians 16 pushed a plot to have fake votes created and then used to make him president despite losing the election 17 ordered republicans to block a bipartisan immigration bill so biden would not get a win before the election 18 is a convicted felon guilty of falsifying records to influence an election 19 had 40 out of 44 of his top staff refuse to endorse him
trump world can claim victory no matter what they do n't know any better there 's never been a candidate who appealed so much with the lowest forms of human life
it does n’t matter about vibe no one side roy changed their vote from biden to trump get real only idiots who wanna see the world burn would vote for trump
he definitely got better as the debate went on but by then jt was too late for many
trump did have a good point that other leaders respect joe less no he was just projecting as usual most world leaders think trump is a joke even his dictator friends laugh at how easily he is manipulated with flattery not to mention how easily their spies can access classified information with trump in charge all they have to do is check the bathrooms at his club
what are you smoking the rest of the world only sees trump as either a joke or a threat to world peace they literally laughed at him on multiple occasions text across%20the%2034%20nations%20polled many%20countries%2c%20especially%20in%20europe
yeah “ enthusiasm ” is not a good metric for whether someone is capable to lead just ask mussolini hitler and putin trump is a convict and apparently a rapist based on the judgement against him he owes more money than his houses are worth and he would tear down the government in an effort to ingratiate himself no one ’s minds were changed last night
kim jong un respects trump but not biden same with putin
it 's surprising that emperor trump 2024 feels this way
i ’m not a trump fan but it was bullshit they changed it to a felony to go back and get trump on a “ felony ” that was a misdemeanor when he did it
reddit is overrun with groupthink if you veer outside the very fringe left you get downvoted or banned
hey i ’ve at least made it to bargaining i ’m just suggesting it might be unwise to immediately cut bait with no plan
the supreme court is a major reason why i ’m voting biden
any media that 's gone out of their way to normalize captain bullshit is the problem
cnn nyt it ’s only a matter of time before political leaders ask for him to drop out
the biggest mistake of 2021 2024 is the democrats not grooming the vp as the obvious replacement for biden harris has done such a poor job as vp she ’s become less popular than trump clear the decks whitmer or another swing state governor
6 6 is a lead that can be closed in 4 months that 's not insurmountable
i think there is some of that but also a lot of ppl that actually have bought into dark brandon supremacy
since 2020 libs like doing that even more than conservatives
they will blame voters and there will be absolutely no self reflection
it 's behind closed doors they are making fun of you lol
so demented he thinks he ’s only 25 happy cake day great grandpa
the delegates are not going to go against the primary results
no biden has enough pledged delegates to win the nomination the party ca n't just nominate someone else instead biden would have to release his pledged delegates and your source is wrong his nomination will be official before chicago he must be nominated earlier to comply with ohio 's election law
we could wheel out jimmy carter to replace him
imagine pete up there last night trump would 've crumbled
people are getting crazy dramatic now
the pendulum needs to swing further to the right before people will rethink their choices
and he ’ll still win against biden unfortunately
what do you think the vibe in biden ’s camp has been today
people will just not vote that ’s what people like you are n’t getting they do n’t have to vote for one or the other if biden ca n’t convince people to vote for him and not just against trump trump wins by default
it ’s not that they ’re gon na change their vote they ’re not gon na show up democratic nominees have always had a lot more trouble getting their base to show up the same way as their republican counterparts and this debacle has had and will continue to have a massive cooling effect on their side while at the same time the clips are going to be used to inject massive enthusiasm into the trump side the two bases are going to vote the way they vote its about swaying the swing voters that can go either way and swing voters are going to trend trump make no mistake
they hate trump even more than biden period the world does not like trump actually very scared if he gets re elected
idk i honestly was center and picked trump last night u will call me a bot or troll but i had to pick between economy and immigration crisis or bodily autonomy and fighting the communist jihadist coalition it was n’t easy for me it ’s not as black and white as you think
the accounting discrepancy argument always makes me chuckle lol like the guy could kill and eat a baby on live tv and it 'd be ' an unfortunate accident that was n't trumps fault that baby had no business being there '
hey i am voting for whatever the democrats run biden is hillary 2016
i wonder if the low polling for the other candidates is solely because of name recognition if one were to replace biden this week then their name recognition would be blasted nationwide especially with a prominent convention enough to be a household name but not long enough for negatives to get entrenched in voter ’s minds
it 's not guaranteed either the whole point is that she has to work hard just to approach biden 's numbers months before the election
who knows i asked the same question about hillary and still have n't got a clear answer she smiles wrong
i ’m not worried about convincing assmaster69 or whoever on reddit they ’re idiots but the party bosses better have a reckoning like real soon
i love pete he is a gay man and the public is n't going to vote for a gay man right now
a debate is one thing winning the presidency is another he could n’t even win the senate seat in texas with the largest influx of out of state money in history
it would n’t surprise me if something comes up so disgusting that people think about it
biden already beat him once what happened since then trump instigated jan 6 was found liable for sexual assault found guilty of inflating his assets roe v wade led to democrat over performances and trump became a felon oh and biden had four successful years and stumbled on his words a dozen times
that he was n't feeling well yesterday and gave a really good speech today
then it ’s up to people to vote no matter what happens get out and vote let the chips fall where they may
they 're scared of what a sociopathic fool like him can do they 're not scared of him personally and they sure as hell do n't respect him just look at the countless videos of world leaders laughing at him and snubbing him on various occasions
trump inherited a good economy made it worse wtf are you smoking
whatever you say you guys are in for a rough ride
it 's only a part of it but i assure you it would n't take long for trump co to bring out every skeleton in their closets every single thing he could use to tank their favs in short order 4 months is more than enough time to get that dirty work done add to that trump will say you supported crooked joe so much right here why not now etc etc
the only thing i can think of is that i think jill biden and kamala hate each other that ’s the only explanation kamala has n’t be able to flourish under jill biden
japan attacked peal harbor and sank almost our entire pacific fleet before we woke up i think we had like one carrier still floating and functional
biden aged about 20 years since then you keep lying to yourself and i ’ll be back for comment in november after he ’s lost
i ’m glad you think so how many people do you think saw his speech today and how many do you think have seen and are going to continue to see the stuff from the debate
with the help of a teleprompter
oh i assure you they 're also scared and right to be 2017 trump was actually far less dangerous and clever than 2024 trump he had no interest in the job beyond the grift prior was shocked he won etc he clearly just wanted the fame the notoriety and everyone to love him before nothing like that now he wants 100 % revenge and retribution on all those in power who would dare defy him this time or beat him prior in 2020 they do n't respect him one bit hate him even if they are n't very impressed by biden or harris either they do n't fear world turmoil and catastrophic consequences from the latter unlike the former
oh damn you ’re right am i embarrassed thank you for the correction
it would n’t surprise me if russia did a cyber attack on us or there was a terrorist attack with hezbollah or iran beforehand considering that could be likely in fact i would not put a secret attack by hezbollah or iran on us soil out of the question
well he ’ll definitely win the old person vote as they make such a statement against all this rampant ageism
lol have you looked a5 any other subs today
i agree with all that but my original response was to a person who claimed that other leaders respect joe less that 's just sheer nonsense to quote the 2024 pew poll linked above across the 34 nations polled a median of 43 % have confidence in biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs while just 28 % have confidence in trump the gap between ratings is quite wide in many countries especially in europe biden ’s confidence rating is at least 40 % higher than trump ’s in germany the netherlands poland and sweden
100 % that 's just a cult member for sure
if you were ' absolutely ' sure you were going to vote for trump after the debate i garantee you were going to ' absolutely ' vote for him before it you were n't undecided you 're just an asshole
after eight years of this surely nobody is undecided everybody knows which side they are on some people just do n’t like to say it out loud tho only question is who will show up to vote and who wo n’t
lol as i pointed out last time this is what s wrong with the us people ignoring what a candidate says or does and simply look at optics
all trump did is ramble bitter word salads and defend racists and jan 6 insurrectionists and nobody is talking about that coverage is lopsided as hell
i glad they found a great candidate in a felon rapist fraudster and failed former president i just hope they can live long enough to realize the monsters they have become
if someone saw the debate and are now saying out loud they ’re voting for trump then they were always going to be voting for trump they just did n’t want to take shit for it trump did nothing in that debate to earn votes
no shot the democrats can win with biden if he stays they will loose the election most people would view voting him in as just cruel he is clearly unwell
anyone who says something like that was already nazi maga to begin with
i did n't know talking to 13 people was good enough journalism to write an entire article about
i know most people on this sub would vote for rotting sewage before they would vote for donald trump and in that regard we have to choose somebody that has an excellent chance of defeating a person that could usher in the destruction and i mean this sincerely of the united states as we know it if project2025 does n't scare the crap out of anyone who reads it where they openly say they will get rid of anybody that does n't sieg heil to the new fuhrer demands destroy agencies get rid of 50 100 000 civil servants replace the military commanders and have all the levers of power including the supreme court we 're back to 1930s nazi germany to entrust an 81 year old guy who froze and looked every bit of 81 and maybe 90 to pull it together is too much to ask granted it 'll be very difficult but i would rather put my money on gretchen whitmer jb pritzer from illinois or a dark horse like andy beshear out of kentucky if a democrat can be very popular and win in a solid red state of kentucky i think he could not only get all the biden voters but poll after poll would show he would destroy drumpf in the most important six or seven so called swing states this election really hinges on maybe 500 000 people and i do n't care what they 're saying about how many people watched that debate last night but the word is out that biden is toast and we can all say that yeah but drumpf is worse and he 's a convicted felon etc but people do n't vote on facts they vote on opinions and the opinion right now is it biden is toast
just watch the video and read the transcripts of bidens speech can you blame them on top of that just watch the end when he can barely make down 3 steps with someone guiding him
biden is for to be president but simply is not fit to campaign and needs to withdraw from the 2024 campaign if he cares about the threat to democracy posed by the gop it 's that simple there 's the question of who should replace him but it 's hard to imagine a democrat who would n't at least be somewhat better than he is for campaigning people love to hate on kamala for example but she 's got like 7 or 8 % better approval ratings and also is much younger than joe and can speak without stuttering she 'd clearly be less bad of a choice than joe and dems have all sorts of other good choices too like polis shapiro whitmer and beshear at this point there 's no good reason to stick with joe
do you want joe biden talking with putin about global issues do you honestly in your heart believe he is capable of that i know you hate trump i do too but biden needs to step down he is not capable of doing the job
i bet for these undecided voters the next most important criteria are whether biden is well dressed and good looking democrats should give these voters a pass
in this debate biden seems unsure how to counter trump overall trump is performing well let 's see what happens in the election
i have to admit i ’m questioning my view on this whole thing maybe i ’m the one who drank the kool aid in a way it sucks but the president has to be able to bring his her best 24x7 that ’s a tall order but it ’s the job maybe i just became an independent roll the reto kennedy ad
trump is to any sane observer an obvious autocratic wannabe he is incredibly corrosive to the democratic system these type of people end the freedom to choose leaders they dismantle the courts restrict the free press restrict voting it wo n't be sudden but gradual just enough to secure power indefinitely this is how america stops being the leader of the free world but instead transitions into another autocratic superpower like china with a political system similar to russia ie a pretend democracy so yes undecided is being blind
i ’d say they claim they were undecided when really they were embarrassed to say out loud they like trump now they can say it because of how biden looked the other night
there are lots of people that are uninformed and avoid politics as much as possible my mother is like that not american or voting there i have no clue who she votes for here or if she ever has
i 'd actually imagine there are more people undecided than ever since no one knows if biden will even make it to election day at this point i 'm sitting here legitimately hoping for a newsom whitmer ticket by convention time
he said he ’d hold nato hostage give putin what he wanted would n’t agree to the election results if he loses etc he said the same thing he ’s been saying for months and none of them are good for america but he ’s absolutely getting a pass from everyone
let 's consider this sub for a second people here have been posting about how completely terrible trump is and how completely great biden is for years there are no issues with biden 's mental acuity it 's all lies slander deep fakes etc and then the debate happens trump lies which is the expectation and biden acts completely senile which do you think is the biggest story what is the biggest shock to people
trump said the same things he 's been saying in every rally for the last 2 years so it makes sense if nobody considers any of it particularly newsworthy
if one debate was enough for them to make up their mind they are an average american citizen or any country 's citizen for that matter i 'm from greece things were the same there edit lol he replied with a completely caustic comment misunderstanding what i typed then deleted it then he blocked me good going there friend
or they do n’t want to be a part of elder abuse
it 's like watching the titanic
that 's funny because there 's an article with 22 5k points on this sub upvoted because it says 14 undecided latino voters asked in a video on twitter would prefer biden than trump
it was if your whole goal was to get clicks
i 'd read this if it had paragraph breaks
yes a dark horse will win come on
so walking is part of this too when it 's been shown he gets stiff legs after standing extended periods like all old people d so blatantly partisan have you forgotten trump with the ramp and the water bottle
if he drops out and someone else is nominated trump is pretty much guaranteed the presidency
do you want donald trump to transform this country into one ran exactly like putins russia like seriously this is the kind of concern we have with trump i ’ll take senile biden i ’m serious people are drastically underrepresenting the threat that trump poses
biden nor any other dem president would have a 1v1 talk with putin only trump would do that and then he would destroy all evidence of what was said
yeah cause putin gives a fuck about “ global issues ” are you asleep
would i be ok with biden retiring if only for his own health sure is he going to probably not and if he ’s the candidate in november i ’m still definitely voting for him over trump i generally am ok with biden and regardless of his health at least i mostly agree with his administration ’s policies versus the current maga dominated gop even if biden suffered a more serious health problem and was just a figurehead with harris and his staff running things that ’s far better than trump
yes i absolutely believe that joe biden is better equipped to talk geopolitics than trump it 's not even close and he 's even weaker when it comes to putin foreign leaders know how to manipulate trump and are n't afraid of his bluster just his stupidity a debate performance is not the full job of president biden did n't perform as a candidate when it mattered he did n't disprove all he has done as president which includes meeting with world leaders or magically wipe away all other examples of him talking just fine it was n't a good look for biden but some of these hot takes are just silly
democrats should give these voters a pass democrats losing with integrity
lying for 40 minutes performing well
could you see yourself getting behind a replace candidate or does that seem like a bridge too far
if you are questioning biden to vote for trump because of a debate performance you are not honest with yourself and anyone reading this one is a rapist convicted felon extreme moral issues had said multiple times he thinks its a good idea to remove president term limits ie our new dictator the other is old not as sharp in a debate give me a break
the system the gqp wants is more in line with iran rather than china or russia christofascists want you to worship their god follow their rules or be persecuted execution for those who hold to a lifestyle they deem ungodly unless you 're rich
one thing that was clear in the debates trump reported how chummy he is with putin over and over he will use us guidebook to remain in power indefinitely
the people voting for trump just wanted an excuse to fall back on so they can blame someone else for what they were going to do anyway
that means you are not undecided
you been living under a rock have amnesia
genuine question why so focused on just the president it 's not like one person makes up the whole administration with trump sure as he is a autocratic leader and wo n't make the same mistake to get people that are n't yes men this time around but biden he has a competent team around him
think of it more like you are voting for a party for president it 's not like your choices are a centrist dem vs a centrist republican
emergency we are in a period of mass hysteria where feelings govern more than anything else of course joe biden should not be replaced replacement was tried in 1968 and 1980 in one case the new nominee lost in the other the incumbent lost there were discussions suggesting that barack obama should be replaced in 2012 and donald trump should be replaced in 2016 but those moments passed and each got into the white house seth abramson goes through a replacement scenario for 2024 which all should read no doubt that many democrats are unjustifiably worried but they are being fed nonstop corporate media fear porn while the internet fills up with operative types pretending to be democrats do n't fall for the hysteria republicans want nothing more than to distract from donald trump by internal division and fighting among donald 's opponents about what democrats should do and who might replace the guy who beat donald in 2020 and won the 2024 primaries and keep in mind that there will be another emergency to cause hysteria in october and october surprise or many of them do n't fall for those either and it is disgusting and suspicious to suggest that joe biden is about to die but even if so it would n't be the first time a president died in office and in every case except abraham lincoln things went on without much change or danger afterward
what makes you think that ’s even remotely possible
i 'm actually really worried how disconnected from reality some of the posters here seem to be trump should be getting destroyed in debates by a competent candidate with factual rebuttals not mostly no you 're lying type answers it 's not about people who were going to vote democrat anyway suddenly not voting for biden because of this performance they were 99 9 % going to do that regardless and the same goes for the maga crowd it 's the small percentage which will be the critical votes of undecideds in swing states that are going to get totally turned off by both candidates and not vote because of their disgust and disillusionment with the candidates biden had to show he was lucid and capable of robustly debating without a script that was the minimum he had to do he unfortunately did n't do that people knew what kind of trainwreck to expect from trump and partially due to the debate format of muting mics and partially due to very unexpected discipline from him at least in the first half he was n't as bad as he could have been despite the absolute torrent of lies coming out of his mouth
biden did not act completely senile just a complete misrepresentation of what happened
biden had an atrocious 15 minutes to start then he got his footing losing your train of thought when you have a stutter are under pressure and trying to generate a good answer is not senility for an hour and a half he answered cogently stop with the senility please
corporate media partisan republican am radio gaming out of xitter facebook and threads demoting political discussion big corporate money and support pink slime sinclair network the well funded republican spam machine etc and you 're complaining that this sub often counters the never ending propaganda excusing donald trump like you did here in this very sub which is the expectation nonsense in thursday 's debate despite a little disorder from the late hour and the overwhelming lies by donald trump joe biden mentioned many specific policies both done and proposed which take quality thinking to conceive and remember whereas donald trump spewed lie after lie
if biden was as you say then why have right wing media outlets needed to edit videos to make this claim seems to me the narrative was set up and then you folks waited for a moment to close the false narrative with 15 minutes of trouble i 'm waiting for a few days to see this all play out but my prediction has been spot on so far
senile lying sociopath appreciate the choice could be better and you do you
amen the people have been lied to by biden 's cabinet the democratic party and msm all coming to surface after this debate and presumably the next one when cnn is covering dem dissent immediately after the debate they hosted you know it 's bad
biden had plenty of lies too with trump correcting him such as how israel wants a ceasefire both candidates are both still in the pocket of aipac though with trump saying he will help finish the job in gaza and biden boasting about giving more weapons for use against palestinians
biden was n't any different either though so it does n't make sense at all
right because donald is so young and cognizant just listen to his high energy word salads
for real the cognitive dissonance on this sub is crazy
it 's just a pure head in the sand moment people do n't want to face the facts which are that biden being like this will more than likely at the very least get some people to not vote altogether if not to switch camps vote 3rd party and if they do n't show up to vote it 's going to affect the house and senate too setting the stage for a republican majority in house senate and obviously the presidency but you know it 's fine things are ok biden did n't do that bad it 's one senile person that 's harmless and a senile person that 's a criminal people had already decided who they 're voting for before the debate yada yada and when november 5th comes around it 's america 's fault for voting wrong
to be fair most people just read the headline of that article which was very misleading
exactly what i was about tho say people against biden stepping down will be responsible for a second term of trump
they know that they are being disingenuous
if he does n't drop out too
that ’s not true gavin newsom would wipe the floor with trump
why would you think that because incumbency advantage
the point is nobody wants either doing that which is why they 're desperate for a new option
just for reference at the height of the cold war with active hot proxy wars all over the world the us and ussr leaders had 1v1 talks all the time it 's actually how we avoided a nuclear war during the bay of pigs incident
trump is putin 's puppet at least biden states very clearly his dismay for putin and what he thinks and will do about things
obama met putin in person and talked 1 to 1 with him pretty much every us president has had conversations with whoever is in charge with russia for at least the last 100 years
you have limited resource time and money you want to use them wisely they absolute would vote for trump because biden did not do well in a debate these are kooks let the republicans spend time and money on them instead of what they just started to do going after black votes
dude the threshold trump has to meet is so ridiculously low lol it ’s objectively sad at how many passes he is given conservative media and his base at best overlook his faults and at worst they accept his faults he fucking brags about it too saying he can shoot someone on 5th avenue and not lose a single vote i do appreciate the democratic party acknowledging how bad biden performed in the 1st half debate and analyzing all proper options including a replacement even though i think it ’s too late for one i feel if trump had been the one struggling for the 1st 20 30 minutes of the debate the republican party would not raise similar alarms i ’m sure blame would be placed on the moderators or the already passed around conspiracy theory that biden would have been on stimulants it ’s comforting to know that there is n’t a hive mind or cult in the democratic party unlike the gop we ca n’t give up the gop wants to follow through with project 25 and institute autocratic theocracy
yes if m obama came in i might rally but it ’s feeling like the entire direction the democrats are going is out of step and they ca n’t turn the ship around much like the tanker that hit the bridge in baltimore it ’s going to get messy
the president has about 5 minutes to decide on how to respond to a nuclear attack you ’re not being honest with yourself on how important it is for a president to be sharp
my day to day life was regular and what do you want me to say
because that ’s who people vote for
but biden he has a competent team around him ok so why does it matter if they swap biden out with someone that 's younger surely there 's only upside right
i 'm not i mentioned a vp as well
hmm here 's the problem i see centrists will toe the party line no matter who we put in there but biden is now a painfully obvious liability for those on the margins who will ultimately decide this election i know what i have to do in november but i also know all too well that when people have to choose between two trash candidates the votes we need simply stay home it is not enough to be the lesser of two evils to win an election you actually have to inspire people to get off their asses and vote for a future they can be excited about living in biden is clearly incapable of delivering that message and therefore unfit to lead replace him with some one under 60 who is a gifted orator and strong debater that can stand up to bullies and expose trump for the con man he is while doing that this candidate also needs to paint of picture of a country that can move past its petty divisions and focus on the next wave of generational prosperity for the american people this is simply what is necessary to win for those who are uncomfortable making the hard decision and prefer to stake our collective fucking future on a zombie candidate there will be no one else to blame for your too scrared to act bording on political malpractice selves in november some 60 % of likely voters had voiced concerns about biden 's age before the debate consider the fact that it was n't the issues that kept the undecideds undecided but joe 's fitness to leader
that argument holds up better when there are n’t two nuclear powers fighting hot wars right now having a guy who can be woken up in the middle of the night to make an important decision as commander of the armed forces matters too
feelings being equal to the fact that the candidate ca n't hold a fucking conversation
100 % nailed it nice post
this i 'm convinced most of these people did n't watch the full debate fucking insane expectations
actually i 'm just pointing out why news agencies are reporting on the bigger story which is that biden is n't all well after all this sub is just downstream from that since all threads are based on news stories
no one has been lied too yes his debate was n't great at the start but he did a rally yesterday and sounded fine
biden 's lies which you call them were not pinocchio level like trump biden might get some facts wrong but he answered the questions biden 's facts can be off but trump did n't even answer the questions while gish galloping lie after lie
are you serious compare to the 2020 debate biden had to show he was sharp and still on his game which have been what his team have been briefing is apparently the situation with him despite the reporting and republican caricaturing unfortunately if you were watching the debate and not just reading the transcript which elides quite a few of the pauses it re enforces what biden 's detractors have been saying about his health
to be frank biden seemed like he was at death 's door i think that surprised a lot of people
seeing all talk about biden being senile while nobody is pointing out trump 's crazy talk made me think of a sublime album where they play this crazy guy ranting raleigh theodore sakers it 's entertaining but totaling insane it 's like if people listened to that and thought it was fine
the democrat voters i know are just refusing to vote after seeing biden like that
undecideds who do n't like either candidate are going to just vote for the couch and stay at home
if he had time maybe the problem is trump would avoid him refuse to debate and not even mention him in speeches it would be impossible to build enough momentum in the time left
i agree gavin newsom would wipe the floor with him unfortunately it 's too late that 's just the way it is i 'd love to see gavin newsom as a candidate i just do n't think it would go over very well right now also lots of people and states outside of california have a hatred for anything california keep trump out and we can sort all of this out afterwards people need to understand and realize what 's on the line right now
game it out for us then how does replacing biden work she 's harris got like 7 or 8 % better approval ratings can you link that poll
that 's fine the only person who would do that today is trump and he would give putin whatever he wants
not at length when russia was actively invading an ally
do y' all honestly believe trump putin is afraid of him hahhaha
obama met putin in person and talked 1 to 1 with him he did n’t have the us interpreters cleared out of the meeting there were no us observers and no record of what was said between poopypants and his boss in helsinki
whenever i see someone pitch michelle obama as a viable presidential candidate i know that i have a pretty good guess what their media diet likely consists of conservative conspiracy shit
you 're not being honest if you do n't think there is a full room of advisors that likely would have the best answer vs one single guy the president is there to choose advisors and go with the best plan they are not the plan and a nuclear attack we are all gone we need a smart cabinet that has a great foreign relations to prevent that it starts before the button is pushed trump ai n't that guy either he leads us to an imminent nuclear attack which is far more dangerous than how we respond to one underway
the difference between biden and trump is one ’s morality i can see how one can say “ i ’m not voting for either ” but i can not fathom a world where someone has been cognitive up to this point and is torn between which one they will choose if they plan on choosing like what is your brain holding out for i am generally curious
can you point to which trump policy caused that or are just assuming that anything that happens to you is a result of who 's in the white house like a lot of people say that gas prices were lower under trump and think he was responsiblefor it but forget that it was actually caused by covid reducing demand and russia was having a price war with opec which drastically increased supply
swapping at this late in the game tells people and undecided voters that we do n't know wtf we are doing people in general do n't like change i wish things were better and there were more options unfortunately at this time there or not this election you vote blue or vote red anything else is a lost vote i do n't like it it pisses me off but that is where we are do your duty as an american and ensure democracy continues we can sort out all the bs later
biden has name recognition and incumbency advantage
there is great value in having a president that knows how the sausage is made and where the bodies are buried obama was only effective because he had someone like joe biden as his vp do you think any of the other democrats that ran against biden would have accomplished as much as he has
yeah biden losing the plot on an abortion question to talk about undocumented people killing women was a seriously bad look it ’s the democrats biggest topical advantage and not only did he completely blow it he looked mentally deficient as well
he was sick and did n't have the best time at this one debate he spoke perfectly fine at the speech he did after the debate
tell me you have n't dealt with death sheesh
we must know different democratic voters
harris took a while to ramp up but she 's doing a good job now however she has absolutely no chance at the presidency
not a poll polling aggregates it 's 538 they have a running tracker of approval poll averages for biden and for harris as for how it would work well first biden would basically need to agree to it if he remains stubborn that 's just kind of the end of that but if he agrees it probably ends up with the convention deciding with the biden delegates being unbound and deciding who they want possibly after a period of a couple weeks where politicians who would like to take biden 's place make their case to the delegates then the delegates vote and make their choice and the party infrastructure shifts to campaigning for them
if course not how is that related to what i wrote
and what is the media diet of someone thinks that only conservatives think m obama is the best shot for dems to win it 's something most dems agree on the only problem is she has repeatedly refused to run
if you have six opinions and ca n’t quickly recall sort and decide it does n’t matter how good your advisors are update you ’re right a nuke attack is an impossible problem and really is n’t a good measure i ’m saddened that uncle joe seemed so addled
because despite what this sub thinks my life was regular with trump and pretty much the same with biden besides inflation i ca n’t stand trump but all i want to do is go work and be left alone i do n’t care about the stuff he does and says that pisses people off i usually vote blue but in this case if the only reason to go with biden is he ’s not trump then i do n’t know
putting biden in a debate already showed the entire world that they do n't know wtf they are doing lol he is running against a criminal pathological liar who tried to stage a coup and who himself seem mentally unstable and incoherent pretty often and biden is still losing
no it tells people who have said he 's too fucking old for almost a year now that we 've finally heard their concerns and are addressing them why do you think they 've been undecided for so long hint it 's not the issues
and running biden guarantees the kind of unenthusiastic response from young that that sunk hillary trumps base is gon na be rocking with their cocks out while the opposite reaction is gon na be seen from biden ’s side
undecided voters will definitely not decide based on what you just mentioned because it has already been on the table for months if not years as biden has been actively campaigning on it so the question is how do you get them to vote and how do you get them to specifically vote blue
name recognition yes incumbency advantage unsure i think for instance not having biden but a new centrist democrat would play much better with swing state progressives that really dislike his handling of israel gaza or just in general quell the fears of centrists that he 's too old not to mention of course inflation yes i know it 's not solely his fault yes the president does n't have complete or even a lot control over the economy most voters do n't know this at all there 's just too many issues that are very important to americans in which biden 's name for better or for worse is tied with
yes biden looked really bad at first he started to sound better and his points were much more concise in the 2nd half of that debate biden ’s performance over shadowed the blatant often off topic lies and hyperboles trump was spewing mainstream media will continue to highlight biden ’s fault while glossing over trump ’s due to trump providing more ratings as a never trumper i am very concerned how biden looked last night since it may sway undecided voters from supporting him i still contend that i ’d rather have the old biden who is deteriorating than also old trump who is a seditious narcissistic convicted felon who is for sale to both foreign and domestic agents
the speech the day after in front of very friendly supporters is n't when it mattered unfortunately that 's a bit like saying i ran round the track the day after the race really quickly and beat everyone who was there that day
registered dem here but in a solid blue state 100 % not voting for biden after seeing that that was not merely a “ bad ” debate performance at times the president literally could n’t hold a thought in his mind for more than a few seconds or finish a sentence his wife had to come lead him off the stage he is going to throw this election for trump it ’s a national embarrassment
yeah i ’m in a swing state hbu
thanks today msnbc was saying harris 's numbers were worse than biden 's but 538 say they 're better we can at least call it a push that said they are n't moving off of biden unless he totally craters in polling over the next couple weeks which is doubtful it 's good to hope though that if he did step down harris should be able to step in all dems would have to be on board
more like a territory dealer and change of ukraine leadership dealer
it 's probably not i assumed shit out of your statement my bad however my statement remains i am in agreement with what you said
it 's something most dems agree on citation needed show me the polls that say more than 50 % of democrats see michelle obama as their best shot
i would ask you to not judge someone by one performance go watch joe 's speech yesterday he is human it 's easy to expect the president to be infallible but that 's not reality biden is not know for his public speaking he has a stutter he is not in the state of deterioration everyone is all riled up about there is enough public speaking opportunities to get another view outside of what you saw at the debates debating is a skill outside of a campaign when will our president be required to have quick clap backs and on the spot counterpoint answers never so who cares he 's not good at it
also one more point for you trump admitted that he had a private conversation with putin about invading urkraine he knew he was going to do that and then pair that up with how he slowed down selling weapons to ukraine i do n't know why so many people are talking about biden vs trump basically admitting to the terrible shit he did with putin
have you seen trumps supreme court are you aware of anything they have been doing
i mean that ’s objectively bullshit no one ’s life was “ pretty much the same ” on account of covid everyone knows someone that at least lost a job got quarantined got sick or even died you ’re telling me not only you do n’t have an opinion on how each administration handles national disaster relief your life stayed the same undecided voters remind me of the quote from comedian nato green “ what do politics have to do with me i ’m not an immigrant or a black person or a muslim or a jew or gay lesbian bisexual transgender or a woman or an old person or a young person or a student or a union member or artist or a journalist or scientist or public employee i do n’t breathe the air or drink the water i do n’t live in a coastal region that ’ll be affected by sea level rise or arid region that ’ll be affected by drought or fire i do n’t like chocolate wine or coffee or other commodities that would be unavailable due to climate change i ’m not pregnant mentally ill disabled or currently being shot at so what do politics have to do with me ”
agreed biden is set up to do worse than hillary right now and its the same hubris of centrist moderates who act like people do nt have and use the right to not vote when they 're not at all excited about the bullshit candidate they try to prop up
i agree so what do we do about it it 's a fucked situation something drastic needs to happen what is that
day after watching him implode on national tv “ look he ’s alive ”
i understand the implications of a debate and how important performance is for voter confidence let 's not act like we are voting on the best debater to go represent us vs other countries who cares if he stumbled some if he is able to get up and give speeches hire competent teams to solve america 's problems and represent us in international relations that is what we need from a president but sure i guess we can get upset he did n't perform in the debates like we wanted but that does n't change a thing for most people if you are eager to vote on a rapist felon who continues to erode american democracy you were planning to do that anyway
you 're not voting for biden but you are concerned about electing trump because he had a rough debate the hyperbole surrounding this performance is absurd maybe you 're lying and this is bullshit maybe you are telling the truth if you are telling the truth maybe it is you that is responsible for throwing the election to trump
i dislike trump but i just like accuracy have a great weekend sir
poll your friend group you mean to tell me no one 's raised the prospect more than once she 's an obvious consideration for anyone who lived in a democratic state from 2008 2016 better orator than her husband knows how the game works we get competent people back in the white house this is n't rocket science or some wild conspiracy you do n't need pundits to tell you that she has name recognition you only needed to listen to her make a speech once to know that she 's actually a better public speaker than her husband she also happens to based in a midwest state if you have n't considered her by this point you seem like the political mole
like i said the trump years were regular for me and mine did n’t like him actually ca n’t stand him and will never vote for him but if that ’s what the dems are offering then seems to me they ’re making their bed themselves
what exactly do you think about we gon na change about covid
it ’s too late what we do about it is stop blindly sucking down what the dnc force feeds us any talk about biden needing to be replaced prior to the debate was down voted into oblivion they need to be voted out it ’s time for a regime change a little more in touch with the population and reality instead they just have the news gaslight us and tell us we ’re wrong they ’re used car salesmen
you are so dramatic lol an old man with a stutter got lost a few times on questions and underperformed you are feeding this media narrative like fucking relax he did n't rape anyone or commit felonies he is n't trying to over throw democracy maybe talk about that more if you want drama
there is only one way that donald trump can get back into power by discouraging voters from coming out for his opposition the single most important propaganda going on now is discouragement
there is a huge uptick of maga cultists right now on here saying “ i hate trump but biden is worse ” or how they are a democrat and not voting at all these are all maga cultists and were voting fascist to begin with its best to not engage with them
he said his vote does n't matter where he lives so he 's not going to bother that 's fair it 's sending a message to the democrats without actually changing the result
lots of things were completely different between the two administrations distribution of ppe stimulus checks this directly affects you federal unemployment assistance vaccine mandates use of the national guard lockdowns interstate travel rules ie faa federal international tourism bans federal funding for emergency relief centers federal funding and allowance for manufacturing food distribution even executive communications from death tolls standards for precautions etc
that is absurd you ca n't trust polling results what happens if in every blue state thousands of people decide they do n't need to bother voting it 's lazy and suicidal
it ’s a pandemic that shit was gon na happen regardless maybe it would have helped a little maybe not
there is no way trump goes in for a second debate
trump ai n’t gon na debate him again he took a huge win yesterday he will leave it at that
biden ’s ego may very well get trump a 2nd term
no way trump would debate him again literally no reason to
trump will quit debates while he 's ahead
what the hell is wrong with these people nobody wants this you ’re honestly a moron if you think another debate is going to fix the damage done you ’re actively begging that moron plus you denied debates up until now get your shit together who in the living hell is running this campaign they should be fired this whole thing reminds me of veep except it ’s not funny
trump does n't need to debate him that first debate gave him everything he needs to coast to victory biden ca n't crash any harder it would be nothing but negatives for trump
he 's just giving him the old rope a dope he 's sandbagging him
he 's got some bad advisers
there is no good options for dems at this point we are fucked the only hope is dems having at least one of the chambers if repugs have senate house and presidency it ’s over the conservative scum will rubber stamp everything thing they do as constitutional i m actually resigned to the latter scenario
well it ca n’t get worse right
maybe for the second debate it can be hosted by fox news with a live audience and no mic mutes
donald did joe last night like he did stormy only difference is joe is lying and paying to cover this one up
this debate was all biden rules and he stole got trumped next debate we need rules set up by the trump team
it was just his childhood stutter guys do n't you remember the same one he had 4 years ago when he got elected he also needs to remind the colored people erm people of color that they are n't black unless they vote for him
is this sarcasm he was a pig in shit he was having a great time
it ’s better for biden if there is no debate
i 'm getting flashbacks to rbg
the ugly truth many ca n't come to grips with
if we switch candidates now they will never achieve the level is support and fundraising as the current incumbent president i wish we had gone with another candidate long ago but here we are if we want to win we need to stick with biden if trump wins the united states will never recover at least not in our lifetimes
let ’s be honest this is not biden saying this but his handlers
are you one of the people who said trump would 100 % chicken out of the 1st debate
considering trump is due to be sentenced next month for his new york convictions it may very well be a case if will trump even be allowed to debate
yes since trump has shown he ’s always one to shy away from a debate
if he were smart he would but
why what reason did this give him to stop
it can always get worse
i believe biden can do better than that performance he has set the bar so low for september as long as he comes out forcefully he can flip the narrative as the greatest comeback in debate history and if i 'm wrong we definitely lose but if he does n't debate again we probably lose anyway if biden stays he has to debate again and do significantly better i just do n't see his team demanding these debates unless last night was a fluke it is either that or they are actively sabotaging biden to pressure him to resign which seems far fetched imo
you are assuming the public cares about party conventions i ’m not sure they do anymore
if someone needs a teleprompter to put together sentences and sound energetic then he has no business being president of the united states or a nominee
“ i would but that sounds absolutely awful ” sunburned albino
what rule was a “ biden rule ”
i think there ’s a logic for him that biden can only look more competent in the next debate so why even give him that chance
why would he allow a second coin toss when he already won the prize with the first one
it ’s better for biden if he goes to his retirement community and sips his juice box and takes a nap replace biden
centrist dems are so afraid of change that they ’ll drive the party off a cliff biden was supposed to be a transitional president he will lose future debates purely due to the unavoidable fact that he looks like a corpse on camera this will snuff enthusiasm and hurt all dems down ballot as well
trump going to jail after this would be a disaster
trump is n’t going to jail
trump skipped all of the republican primary debates because he rightly understood there was little to gain and more to lose debating candidates he was already beating in the polls trump is already ahead in the polls in the general and stopped biden ’s momentum with the first debate continuing to show up only gives biden more of a chance to catch up without fundamentally changing trump ’s position
trump is 3 years younger than biden
trump quit them with the primaries held his own rallies
why would trump even debate again republicans can replay clips of the greatest hits from this debate and it will be very effective no more ammo needed
are you serious no audience no 3rd party limited media access etc
maybe but that does n't like trump logic as i 've witnessed it he truly believes he is good at this abstaining on the non zero chance he might choke does n't sound like him also this is the biggest mainstream appearance he 's been given in years and it was a disaster for his opponent i think he wants to do it again
unless his minions convince him to not do it he will the only reason he dropped it last time is because it was clear he lost this time it ’s clear he won so we will want more trump is beyond predictable it ’s sad
because he 's a narcissist not a strategist he probably has n't had a jolt like this since they charged the barricades for him he 's going back to the well for another drink i do n't think he could help himself
we 're hoping and praying that another trump scandal pops up at the 11th hour maybe he might get charged with multiple felonies oh wait
i would not be surprised if that happens because even if he goes to jail or has house arrest that would shake up the race entirely i wish that this was an election when we did n’t have to worry about democracy itself
i ’ll take house arrest as well but i guess we ’ll see what happens come july
frank lutz said his second by second polling showed both candidates saw negative results the more they talked we know trump ca n't do any better but presumably biden can or his team would n't have demanded these debates that or they are purposely trying to sabotage him and get him to drop which is far fetched
why do people debating need an audience in house their audience is the american people on tv any distractions from that simply takes away from what the candidates might be trying to convey during their time why are you against that no 3rd party is not a biden rule there is a threshold that has been set on presidential debates for decades why does the media need access it ’s broadcast live for everyone to see media included
oh yeah he ’s a showman who ’s never shied away from a debate he ’ll definitely do it again
he 'll hold off on the little ego boost of a second debate for the biggest ego boost of becoming president again even if you think he 's a complete idiot an idiot can see agreeing to another debate is a terrible idea
i mean the optics would be god awful after the disaster of biden 's debate performance sure he does n't directly have anything to do with it but conspiracies catch fire with a lot less kindling than that
thish is preshident turmph got any money
lol again mods get to work
so you literally ca n’t post a story about the republican candidate here that is n’t negative lol
trump cares a lot about the issue of mass illegal immigration he is resolved to put a stop to it
this is morbid opportunism which is absolutely disgusting
he was resolved to put a stop to illegal immigration back in 2016 with his big beautiful wall that mexico was supposed to pay for it never happened the phone call to jocelyn nungaray 's mother was just more political grandstanding and you and every other hardcore trump supporter are foolish enough to fall for it
by halting hindering the immigration reform bill in the legislature
glad you pointed it out absolutely nobody else cares about this or is capable of doing the deed bend thy knee maybe he 'll toss out some toilet paper to us minions
okay you can have that viewpoint but there ’s no reason this ca n’t be posted on here lmfao
yet there is no problem posting parkland shooting kids protesting or any gun violence victim ’s relatives calling for gun control
have you happened to have noticed a difference in the amount of people entering the country under the current administration vs the last one
i get the dislike for trump but when has he ever used an extermination camp that ’s just made up
it was a dismal bill unacceptably bad biden reverted everything trump did to secure the border illegal immigration skyrocketed during biden 's presidency all he had to to is keep in place what trump had done
it was posted and remains posted
you mean when covid hit the entire world and nobody wanted to travel that ’s the only reason his numbers went down because of covid
you ’re completely wrong on so many levels the bill was the toughest immigration reform bill in 4 decades donald was president for 4 years and has a good sentence and congress and failed to pass any bill at all undocumented people were crossing g the border at high levels until 2019 when covid hit and it was that statute that biden got rid of when he declared the pandemic over the bill you call weak would have passed unanimously and with bipartisan support had trump not called the speaker to kill it and he only did that to run on it it ’s sickening it ’s u patriotic it ’s treason
they were referring to it being removed before and someone in the comments telling the mods to remove it probably
i just fact checked you on illegal immigration levels before covid and you ’re wrong
it was a terrible bill no honest person who has looked at it could support it
you are rebublicans in the senate helped create it and the same republicans tanked it when trump said to do so the brookings institute republicans in both the house and senate yielded to objections from their all but certain presidential nominee former president donald trump once the house speaker stated publicly that he would not allow the senate bill to reach the house floor for a vote republican senators were unwilling to run the political risk of supporting a measure that would not become law
again they tried this in 2020 and look at how much former president trump won
they had four years to yield a better prospect than biden who won then a whole other bunch of years to follow him with a solid prospect to secure the executive office yet here we are another election with shitty choices foh with this crap already
not the rapist the guy who had a bad night not the guy who opened a firehose of bullshit all over the debate stage not the one found guilty of 34 felony charges they call for biden to step down fukking clown shoes
the us is looking pretty fucked
i understand that biden is n’t as sharp as he used to be but i ’m still going to vote for him even if we have to weekend at bernie him through the second term
whitmer is the candidate here she wins you michigan which gets you halfway to the presidency she can articulate the abortion debate effectively can personally speak to the dangers of maga and white women will love her
much easier said than done after freaking out last night i ’ve decided to follow joe ’s example pick myself up and move on reminded myself that there ’s no way i would vote for a convicted felon who incited an insurrection no matter how old his opponent is and i trust there ’s a majority of voters who feel like i do
so did cnn it 's time to move on from cnn it 's just a propaganda mill now they 're slamming other organizations for something that they 're also doing they have no credibility any more you 've been warned i 'm done with nytimes over the absurd theatrics as well i do n't know why these companies are destroying themselves it seems like somebody who is not honest is running them now
i call for the nyts editorial board to leave journalism
this conversation is so stupid polls have shown time and time again that biden is the only dem candidate that ’s even close to standing a chance against trump biden is n’t running because he ’s some power hungry maniac he ’s running because he ’s the best chance of beating trump talking about how dems should have built up another candidate in the past 4 years is totally fair but acting like biden dropping out will help dems is a nonstarter and is exactly the kind of division that republicans were hoping for
why are there so many “ article of an article ” posts floating around now every outlet from cnn to cnbc is just re re examining the same nyt editorial piece why are y’ all just rewording the same article for us 10k times
it ’s not going to happen but it would be interesting if biden and harris flipped their ticket having harris run for president and biden for vp biden in the consulting vp position instead of harris preemptively alleviates the health concerns while maintaining a status quo for their current administrations policies that they presumably mostly agree on mind you i ’m voting for biden in november assuming he has n’t stepped down as the nominee i ’d vote for any democrat over trump and frankly rfk jr is a nutjob he ’s a non starter even if i thought he had a non zero chance of winning in the first place i ’ve said before i think biden probably should have retired after this term if only for his own personal health sake but if he ’s the nominee then he ’s the best way to keep trump out of office and in terms of policy i ’m overall ok with biden
the new york times is a corporate mouthpiece we call for the editorial board to be replaced
reminder complaints are not solutions complaining about biden performance is not a solution no plan beyond “ stepping aside ” 4 months before the election helps trump
i care not a whit on how he did on a debate stage he sounded great later on and today at a rally if magats can ignore trump being a rapist felon who tried to overthrow democracy i can ignore biden being an old guy who sounds old and biden is n’t stepping down so these editorials are a waste
if he does n’t it ’ll be an easy win for trump
hey nyt maybe instead of insisting biden drop out insist the republicans stop being a cult supporting a convicted felon rapist push that hold gop members accountable for the bull shit they 've pushed on us it 's not joe biden or democrats fault trump exist blame the people propping trump up
funny they did not call for trump to leave after he became a convicted felon
new york times lol they employ trump 's mouthpiece maggie haberman russian assets are ruining reddit with their anti biden anti american propaganda
neither candidate said anything about policies but sure let 's talk avoid who golf 's better i 'm ready to see this two party system bite the dust
just saying nytimes should n't be called a news organization anymore
they ’ve been pro trump for awhile now
maybe do n’t “ both sides ” the choices there ’s a significant difference between being old and being old and a rapist and a felon and who locked brown children in cages context matters
tô be fair context the entire article revolves around beating the rapist and nyt editorial believing that biden is incapable of doing that after last night terrible just downright awful display
i can remember when people bowed out of primaries for cheating on their wife not paying taxes on their nanny 's income and yelling slightly too loudly 34 felony convictions and an adjudicated rape where is the resounding republican and media chorus demanding trump step down
did you read the editorial they do n't want trump to win and they do n't think biden can pull it off
the question is not whether biden is a better option than trump of course he is the question is whether he is the best person to represent the democratic party in this election a better d candidate who can speak coherently attract more support and project a more presidential level of competence would also be a better option than trump and might have a better chance of winning
they 're calling for biden to step down because if he does n't trump 's victory is all but assured and we can kiss our democracy goodbye democrats need to move swiftly and decisively and choose a new candidate rather than continuing to insist the emperor 's clothes are beautiful after he just hung dong on stage for 2 hours for 50 million people to see
i do n’t think you understand what is actually going on
imo they only use the editorial board for big messages they hope will change or affect something they know the right wing does n't like or trust nyt they do n't mince words about trump and explicitly say he 's destroyed the legitimacy of the gop there 's a chance dems will listen zero chance gop will
no they call for it because obviously the dude with 34 felonies is n't stepping down so if you want to gamble beating him on the health of biden good luck that 's more risk than i want any healthy young dem dusts trump biden polls below the democrat party in general
being right does not equal winning
agree 1000 % they never said jack about trump biden has a rough outing and they want him to quit guess what so does the speaker of the house that ’s good enough for me go joe
the only person trump ever beat was the first white woman democrats ran for president i do love whitmer tho so i ’m conflicted
as a 30 year michigan resident and someone with no plans to vote in november i 'd go vote for whitmer in a heartbeat
i agree but not newsom if you want to win the swing states of az and nv rightfully or wrongfully people really hate the guy here they will associate him with ca and all the negative things the media says about that state and enough people will either stay home vote third party or vote trump
so many are voicing their opinion that biden should be replaced fine but among these loud voices i still have to hear who the better candidate is the loud voices remain silent on that “ minor detail ” as far as i know there is no mechanism for primaries in the time left until the elections there is also no time to take a relatively unknown candidate and make them the runner up it should be someone with national recognition but anyway the democrat party is a supermarket of ideas there is nobody that everyone in the party will get behind them the candidate should also appeal to independents and unaffiliated voters that ’s a tough call
we need someone like newsom who has charisma lol newsom
wes moore is the best candidate the democrats have but it would take a massive push because he has no name recognition at the national level whitmer is probably the most realistic option but it 's a risk because the gop will hammer her over her covid policies and that could sway some voters
you sound like a maga republican screaming at the tv when they see or hear a liberal pundit on a conservative show
i mean they ’re both correct though keeping biden in just plays right into trumps hands any trump supporter is praying that biden stays in the race any dream of biden winning this race is just copium in a bubble either democrats will find a new nominee or trump will be re elected with project 25 why even take the chance joe is a lot less popular that he was in 2020 and trump is at the least more bearable in many voters minds especially independents i just do n’t see how biden gets the numbers
win 138 pulitzer prizes to their 137 and perhaps people will care what you have to think
he ’s running because he ’s the best chance of beating trump until last night i 'd have agreed with you wholeheartedly but after last night i 'm not sure i agree that 's true anymore one of the big advantages of a younger candidate would be that all of the digs at biden 's age could instantly be turned on their head and used against trump i do n't think the division is nearly as big of a risk as people make it out to be there 's too much at stake as a faithful democratic voter i 'm happy to stand behind biden but i 'd be just as happy to stand behind any other nominee
exactly the opposite is true biden is one of the least popular candidates in history and polls have shown that any other dem beats trump by double digits
easier than hiring more employees and giving them enough time to write their own articles
it is quite literally democrats fault trump exists
what ’s his fundraising message “ the fight is not over we need the support of heroes like you to defend democracy i wanted to make you proud and i know i shit the bed but like my mother said to me as a boy growing up in scranton pennsylvania “ you shit the bed you clean it up joe “ will you help me clean it up chytectonas ”
you really going to continue parroting that point regardless of trump 's status as a completely shitty human being biden remains a significantly unwelcomed and unwanted candidate i want a president not a god damn stop gap to allay fears of more maga bother on about biden being a decent human being and trump a malignant shitstain it does not alter the fact that biden is comically far from ideal and what the fuck instead if demanding better you 're doing these no shit sherlock talking points
which is one of the key reasons i 've abandoned the party at this point i railed against biden every step of the way back in 2020 largely because he ran on the message of working with republicans despite all of the harm they were doing to the country despite the fact that trump was and still is their leader i tried to convince people that he was the worst possible choice but he won i wo n't say it was an entirely democratic process which is of course part of the problem but the fact that the party pushed him much the same way they pushed clinton and that voters went along with it just like they did with clinton made me realize i just ca n't be a part of the democratic party anymore
none of these people will have an honest conversation with you these are the same people who got us where we are
the problem is simple even trump gets it no viable serious alternative exists that 's the situation dems are now in he went after michelle obama today who got a 7 poll vs him who of course would not ever run even if she was 10 against trump as she hates politics if there were neither newsom nor whitmer nor sanders would all get behind biden in force to deflect from the awful msm coverage or press covfefe here
they had a real primary and their voters picked him
at this point that ship has sailed changing horses mid stream now would be a weak move unlikely to succeed there would likely be a shit show of candidates vying for the position and trump reveling in the disarray the only way it could possibly work would be a consensus substitution brokered at the convention and democrats would be dead in the water until they ironed out who their candidate was even if done in the best possible way it would be very risky
i ca n't believe people do n't get this even the best athletes get benched if they stick around too long golden opportunity for an off ramp here and people do n't want to take it it 's extremely frustrating
and we want to give him a bigger win if this ends up the case why the hypotheticals all poll worse than biden right now even trump himself in a rare moment of his 1 % time of being honest came out and said it today
there ’s no one who wants to run that can be vetted in time they ’ll pick a new person and they ’ll quickly realize the reason why they moved when the candidate was 8 was because the town believed the candidate pushed someone into traffic we ’ll re elect biden and he ’ll resign in february
donald trump has proved himself to be a significant jeopardy to that democracy an erratic and self interested figure unworthy of the public trust he systematically attempted to undermine the integrity of elections his supporters have described publicly a 2025 agenda that would give him the power to carry out the most extreme of his promises and threats if he is returned to office he has vowed to be a different kind of president unrestrained by the checks on power built into the american political system this is the second paragraph of the editorial that you clearly did n't read go read it and figure out why they are calling for biden to step down
someone with no plans to vote so you admit to not giving a single shit about this country
at this point i ’ll take literally any democrat who can string words together in a coherent sentence any one of them pull a name from a freaking hat for all i care just not him
whitmer gets you michigan then you get spend all the money in pa
mark cuban or jon stewart
i think people are saying newsom because he has warm blood like that 's basically it lol
either democrats will find a new nominee do you not understand that it 's too late joe biden is already the nominee if joe biden steps down then donald trump will be president again there is no need to have an election if joe biden does that trump will win 538 to 0 there wo n't be any elections after that either is that what you want you want donald trump to be president because joe biden had 15 minutes of objectively bad debate performance nothing else he did matters at all anymore because he did poorly in a debate just hand the whole country to the conservatives so they can implement their project 2025 plan and permently destroy the country because joe biden had a bad debate performance you know i 'm trying to be as polite as possible but what you are saying makes absolutely zero sense to me
the new york times has a very close relationship with columbia university columbia university appoints members to the pulitzer prize board nearly every new york times editor will be considered for the board and will be considered for a pulitzer the gray lady employs great journalists but it is n’t surprising that they win often that said my point is that biden was sick and had a bad showing he ’s still the best person for the job right now
also trump was elected in a legitimate primary by his party
so you ’re not getting everything on your christmas list and you ’re upset it ’s hard to take such entitlement seriously you ’ve validated the need for “ no shit sherlock ” reality check comments your comment comes across as extremely privileged
lawrence o’donnell is doing this exact sort of gaslighting on msnbc right now he took on a very different tone last night that ’s for damn sure trying to shift the conversation to how terrible trump is not realizing that that ’s the whole point if biden ca n’t win we may need a drastic change in this race to prevent the convicted felon from winning if these people hijack the conversation we ’re sleepwalking into another four years of trump
yup they live in a bubble and are the primary cause of trumpism this impossibility of looking at things from other people 's perspective and belittling people and dumbing down conversations is exactly why people have a visceral reaction to democrats we got a taste of a good direction for the party with bernie focusing on anti corruption and policy focused campaigns instead of clichés and identity politics
if it ’s someone else ’s fault what exactly is your solution what ’s the plan beyond “ biden should step down ” who steps in what data shows they have a better chance here ’s your chance to converse
there are viable alternatives newsom and whitmer polls do n't matter at this point because people barely know who they are but if they announced their poll numbers would shoot up as people starting giving them attention
sanders has to defend biden if he does n’t the dems will happily blame him when biden loses
ok sure but staying with biden is also risky what is the greater risk it does n’t seem that obvious
pretty sure biden is polling worse than no candidate at all and way below the dem party in general so seems that far from being an advantage his name recognition is a negative put in some no name staffer they will poll better than biden against trump
off ramp was months if not years ago
polls do n't matter because these people are unknown to the general public at this point in late 2007 obama was polling in the 20s
interesting that this is the one thing you decide to trust trump on have you considered that he 's saying this precisely because the idea that they 'll swap biden out for someone else worries him
ya because no one has tried to dig up dirt on whitmer or newsom in their decades of public service s when it comes to politics there 's an inverse relationship between how confident someone is and how much they actually know you 're very confident
whitmer would n’t even need to be vetted republicans have been attacking her for years and not a single punch has landed besides she ’s a moderate middle aged middle class white suburban soccer mom i know anyone could potentially have skeletons in their closet but i ’m just not seeing it
what indication do you have right now that biden would win re election
stop this mentality biden ca n’t win full stop making excuses wo n’t help him win
at this point it 's a risk worth taking it 's a gamble and there s a good chance it will fail but there s a 100 % chance the walking piece of taxidermy they put on stage last night loses this november
friend i did read it it made some cogent points i agree he had a horrible night last night i just do n’t think it ’s time to throw in the towel
quite the contrary actually which is why after biden 's performance on thursday i think i 'll just stay home november 5th
i ’m pro biden but if he were to drop out which i ’m not encouraging i like jamie raskin and think he ’d destroy trump in a debate in a few years when the us is ready for a gay president i feel pete will be amazing glad to see he ’s getting his reps in in washington politics instead of small ball south bend indiana he ’s being groomed to lead the democratic party and i ’m eager to see him succeed
he literally is n't the nominee yet though there is still time i 'm not sure what world you 're living in where joe biden is the sole person who can win against trump a generic democrat consistently polls ahead of both biden and trump almost any well known democrat could potentially win
he actually is n’t the nominee until the convention
you do n’t seem to understand that all these arguments apply to biden staying in the race he ’s quite simply cooked
biden ca n’t win we need someone else let ’s stop with the bullshit
wake up this is n't about a bad debate performance this is his mental deterioration put in display in contrast with trump biden will lose almost every state if he stays
the job of funding genocide
now i 'm entitled and being related to a child is this how you lobby votes this how you find allies i suggest admit the shit show is a shit acknowledge the democratic party is part of the problem or accept that you yourself are party to the problem in which case you and your opposition deserves each other would be great if you two minorities would leave the rest of us out of it have a nice day
honestly those people have been controlling the conversation for years i think after last night lots of people are just waking up to the fact that democratic leadership and their online cheerleaders have been pissing on them and telling them it 's raining for way too long
it ’s honestly horribly and depressingly hilarious how vacant and shallow all these people are all they know are memes
so why have you ceded the conversation by not providing an actual detailed solution complaints are not solutions
there would be a civil war in the party as different factions vie for the nomination and backers leave when their favorite is n't the choice people really are n't thinking this through a simple anointment of an alternative is a fantasy
and that was a fucking year before the election that 's enough time to focus and build a campaign weeks before the convention is n't it 's not enough time to even solidify the base around a single choice and avoid infighting at a time when they need to be focused on the general
there ’s a huge difference when running for president of the country and running for governor of california running for governor they try to attack you and running for president they go after anyone you might invite to the white house
the reason why biden was so electable is because he is very moderate he even only reluctantly supports marijuana legalization any one you add has to be someone trump hating right leaning independents can get behind
it 's not that he will win it 's that statistically he 's still more likely to win than switching options mid race and trying to solidify the base around a new one he needed to never run but surprise he ran because there was no other stand out option and that has n't changed since last year when he decided to run dems keep playing the same damned note on repeat ever since obama 2008 2012 obama 2016 obama 's sos 2020 2024 obama 's vp they have n't invested in raising up new blood in nearing on two decades they have no one ready their best option newsom is n't an option he 's a california dem that represents everything the gop screams about liberal states and liberal cities he is too easily attacked without a year of building up a campaign around him to insulate those attacks and counter gop messaging everyone wants to switch from biden to other but when other ends up specifically defined people will go wait that 's not what i wanted and we have party infighting and we 're back to they rigged it against bernie all while trump looks on as he attacks dems and smiles because the dems are too preoccupied fucking around with their own shit to actually mount a campaign against him in time
we need to see the polls if biden loses double digit support then we can talk otherwise it ’s one set back with plenty of reasons to stay the course especially because gop secretaries of state will try to keep the replacement ’s name off the ballot ohio and vermont already tried to keep biden off their november ballots because they said the dnc convention is a few days too late if they raise a remotely valid legal issue it will be brought to the right leaning supreme court
so you read it and then you wrote they never said jack about trump why lie
so again you admit to not giving a shit about this country
there ’s a conflict and we have an ally in that conflict unfortunately removing biden from office wo n’t stop the bloodshed or bring anyone back
you seriously think backers are going to view trump as a better option over newsome or whitmer or pick your candidate if biden drops out
this is what happens when people in a party care more about themselves then the good of the country
it 's that statistically he 's still more likely to win than switching options mid race and trying to solidify the base around a new one you have absolutely no statistics to back this claim up so do n't use that word here
i 'd say whitmer would have been a great potential 2024 candidate and i 'm almost positive she 'll run in 2028 she won michigan twice by large margins is an excellent campaigner strikes the perfect balance between moderation progressiveness and since the democrats took both chambers of the legislature has passed a flurry of major reformers including climate protection that rivals california 's in manner that appeases environmental groups and labor unions repealed the right to work law protecting lgbtq rights and more i 'd also throw shipiro in there as well but he still needs time to build his resume
there 's no stand out because they did n't have a primary this year newsom would have a good chance because he actually does a good job fighting for his points and arguing his case he 's a good politician
ok sure i m pretty confident the polls will bear this out over the next couple weeks but the convention is 6 weeks away if they are going to do something they need to do it soon
not lying it ’s late and i may have been misread what i meant was that the nyt through all of trump ’s drama never asked him to step aside or resign sorry who do you think we should enlist to take on this job and who actually will
and if you 're going to vote for biden after what you seen on thursday then neither do you
there 's a genocide that is able to be carried out solely because of our financial and military support it 's so insane to me that liberals have become so brain poisoned that they will defend funding genocide at this point
who ’s newsome the guy that was married to juniors girlfriend
no i do n't think that they just wo n't vote or they 'll go 3rd party
i ’m sure the fox news poll will ask something like “ after biden ’s unhealthy performance in the debate against trump will you still vote for him if he lives till november ” biden will lose 5 % from that poll and every media outlet will call for him to step down immediately
in the first paragraph of this article from last month they describe him as unfit for office for many reasons
trump shill over here is n't fooling anyone
the other candidate literally said we need to “ let israel finish the job ” in the debate last night he meant genocide trump said last night on live tv that israel should just genocide the palestinians and joe biden was preventing it and you are here bitching about joe biden on behalf of who hamas perfect is the enemy of good figure it out dude
yep before she turned into a ghoul
dude if you ca n't see how serious this is i do n't know what to tell you we would n't even be talking about this if it was n't a total catastrophe the president of the united states had trouble forming complete sentences last night this is really really bad
i understand that again do we do what the nyt and mike johnson want or do we recognize the guys old but he ’s a good man and pick him over the fascist
i 'd go vote for whitmer in a heartbeat huge trump shill
deranged answer 40k dead innocent palestinians funded by joe biden rest are being starved and have been displaced if you are defending this you 're too far gone
that ’s literally all i know about newsome and he ’s from california
i realize it is serious but it is too late we need to leave this up to the voters as soon as you try to replace biden there will be lawsuits and this entire thing will turn into a circus additionally biden ’s cabinet will be brought into congress to try to say that his cabinet should have recognized that biden was no longer fit to be president and anything he signed recently will be called unlawful what i am saying is s i get the stakes are high but my concern is that the courts have been weaponized by the gop if we give them an opening they will attempt to get the supreme court to say trump is the only valid candidate
he 's not a good man not by a long shot do n't confuse good with better than trump and it 's not about age it 's about competence like you i do n't care what mike johnson thinks newsom whitmer harris all seem like reasonable choices here i think any of them could beat trump
go out and vote do you not realize how big this election is if you do n’t vote then we wo n’t have an election ever again
“ deranged ” did n’t address my point just more of the same bullshit perhaps palestinians should n’t elect terrorists to represent them and launch attacks on children at music festivals then hide behind their own children trump said wipe them all out so it ’s better to support him
it ’s a fair point i guess we ’ll see cheers
you seem really confused on whether you support genocide or not do babies and women deserve to get carpet bombed because their parents and grandparents voted in an election 20 years ago for the netanyahu supported party or are you worried trump is going to wipe them all out you need to pick one
everyone remain calm and try to enjoy the last 6 months before fanatics take over and the purge begins yolo
perhaps he just had a cold i ’m sure he ’ll get better that ’s apparently what these folks panicking must have thought as biden has clearly demonstrated the effects of age on his mental affect over the last year at least what were they expecting this reminds me i recently visited my elderly mother i was warned prior that she had deteriorated quite a lot since i saw her 6 months ago but i was n’t shocked at all by the change because i ’m aware of how decline from age works i ’d still vote for her over trump and i do n’t even like mom much
from bloomberg news reporters jordan fabian josh wingrove jennifer jacobs and saleha mohsin dismayed donors aides lawmakers and voters spent the hours after president joe biden ’s sputtering debate presentation grappling with what if anything could be done about an 81 year old leader hitting the unquestionable low point of his presidency at the worst possible moment from washington to wall street in furious emails between donors and at press conferences in foreign capitals many reached the same conclusion that the only hope for democrats and others interested in staving off a return of former president donald trump would be for biden to go at a defiant friday rally in north carolina biden told a crowd that while he might not be able to speak or debate as well as he used to he believed “ with all my heart and soul i can do this job ” but that was cold comfort for those still reeling from his debate showing concerned that the president ’s stubborn pride and a series of miscalculations by his inner circle have left the makings of a debacle for democrats read the full story
everything is getting downvoted to zero immediately today haha
this article perpetuates an insane double standard sure 34 felony convictions is bad but biden had one bad night oh no
it was disastrously bad but he 's not dropping out and he 's light years better than the alternative
i think this guy had a mini stroke two months ago he is totally different the way he stands walks talks and stares
my mom was a paranoid schizophrenic who threatened to kill me as a child and i 'd vote for her over trump tbh trump reminds me of her quite a bit
1 belongs in jail and 1 belongs in a nursing home sitting in a wheelchair drooling in the memory ward however what people keep forgetting is that it is n't the candidate personally running the country it 's the senate congress and government running the show i 'd still vote for biden to save the country
people are n't writing about the felonies because we know about the felonies it is n't news biden performing that badly is news it 's the biggest criticism others have had and now it appears very very real trying to other side or downplay the issue is n't going to help biden 's campaign debates do super bowl viewer numbers this shit is going to dominate the news cycle it 's bad really bad and people need to wake up and realize that
he could n't form sentences and looked like he had no idea where he was i 'll still vote for him i d vote for a wet sock over trump but to say that was one bad night is underselling it a bit
the double standard is that we were all calling trump unfit for his mental capacity when he was president and we just witnessed the current president with warm oatmeal for brains that 's the double standard stop copy pasting this you 're acting like a bot
one bad night biden looked and sounded like he was gon na die any second and he 's not getting any younger healthier or more coherent if democrats do n't replace biden trump will win
and is looking much better the next day at the nc rally modern medicine really turned that stroke around lol
would n't be the first time that happened to a sitting president
if democrats do replace biden trump will win we are four months from the election we ca n’t spin up a campaign that quickly
they messed up his adderall dose
hypothetically biden steps down are there really any biden voters that wo n't vote for the new nominee i do n't think so but right now the people that do n't like biden or trump are going to stay at home and not vote thus handing the election to trump if a new nominee gets in i can see alot of those double haters voting for the 50 60 years old candidate over trump and feeling okay about it
replacing him might actually inject some juice into this thing because right now trump world is vibing they ’re rocking out with their cocks out run biden he ’s gon na lose his base has had all the air taken out and the independents they were hoping to sway with a strong debate showing are going to trend towards trump
that 's just not true the majority of voters have consistently said both that they do n't want trump and they think biden is too old they will vote for someone else as long as it 's a decent candidate it wo n't even be close
california is n’t going anywhere doom articles until election day
if last night 's debate bothers you then it means you 're choosing feelings over facts the feelings everyone has is that biden looked awful last night the facts are trump 's policies were never mentioned last night therefore he does n't have a plan on how he wants to run the country trump could n't tell us what his plans were if elected biden has a plan that most americans want to see happen trump has a proven record of failed policies whereas biden has been consistent on passing policies into law our economy can handle one bad debate but it sure as shit ca n't handle two trump terms
california is important because we need gavin to replace joe
this title is crafted entirely to get more clicks than it actually has to do with the content maybe here 's some corrupt stuff that 's been happening in california it has nothing meaningful to do with the debate results which are mentioned in a vague rhetorical way only in the last two paragraphs
if cali turns red i m leaving the country lollll
his only plan is to stay out of jail enrich himself and get revenge on those he believes wronged him
gavin would be almost as bad of a candidate as biden as a californian i ca n’t believe some of you are serious about this
as a californian myself who has paid attention to politics since the jimmy carter administration i say that gavin could definitely beat trump because he could beat him at his own game gavin is way more savvy than trump could ever be did you watch the debate last night and the fact that joe could not put a coherent thought together would n't you think gavin would have done a lot better job and subsequently would have a way better chance at beating trump
none of that matters making the governor of expensive af california the nominee during a cost of living crisis is completely insane four california cities just got named impossibly expensive ” the ads would write themselves he also has a ton of personal baggage not as much as trump but enough for low info swing state voters to throw up their hands and say it ’s a wash whitmer and shapiro are much better options
i do n’t think the rest of the country knows about the number of personal and political scandals gavin has besides the french laundry incident he would lose against trump
yes and a lot of california dems are burying their heads in the sand about how much of a liability the state ’s hcol is for the party nationally part of the reason nevada might go red and texas is not going blue anytime soon is because both states keep getting californians who are mad at the democrats for pricing them out of their home state
do you want two more supreme court justices appointed by trump if not you still vote and vote for the dem candidate even if it 's biden
the media spent the entirety of 2020 saying biden would get trounced by trump and instead of taking a moment for introspection they all collectively decided to pretend it never happened
the number of people saying “ well this does n’t change my vote ” do n’t know any swing voters the amount of people on here going off about how “ it does n’t matter that biden struggled ” and “ i ’m still voting for biden ” and “ i ’d vote for a pile of trash over trump ” do not understand that the problem from last night was swing voters a large number of people watched last night and decided they will vote against biden just like you will vote against trump if you do n’t believe me it ’s because you do n’t talk with swing voters i have family and friends in multiple different swing states like wisconsin and georgia and suddenly their vote is n’t so sure after last night democrats have to stop pointing at biden ’s success as a president and look at his challenge as a candidate he had a terrible showing as a candidate last night and if democrats do n’t put up a new and younger candidate we can all say hello to project 2025 i will be voting for the candidate nominated by the dnc in november but if it ’s biden mark my words trump will win the electoral college by a landslide
trump ’s presidency took away the right for women to choose
my favourite analysis so far some sections are particularly scathing the simple fact that trump spoke loudly and clearly and with by his standards relative self discipline coupled with the lack of interrogation from the moderators granted him a plausibility he should have been denied he is a failed coup leader nationalist populist menace and racist who would suck up to the world ’s autocrats and throw ukraine to vladimir putin ’s wolves he should be allowed nowhere near power but because he was up against a man who could scarcely complete a sentence he was presented as a legitimate option for the world ’s highest office expectations were rock bottom all he had to do was turn up and show some vigour reassure people that his marbles were all present and correct and it would have been enough the bar could scarcely have been lower but joe biden could not clear it the expectation must now be that if he faces biden on 5 november trump will win he was ahead in all of the battleground states even before the debate and there is now no clear further chance for a reset thursday night ’s head to head was supposed to be that moment indeed that is why the white house opted to have the debate so unusually early to allay fears about the president ’s age and to reframe the race not as a referendum on biden but as a choice that gambit doubly failed making a bad problem much worse
biden 's got a good support system around him professional people who are going to be competent at their jobs and a vp who i think could do a good job taking over if needed trump has himself as vp because he does n't trust anybody all of his previous support folks are under indictment are headed to prison or are family members that just used the office to personally profit so we 're really voting for the whole package not just biden
old enough to remember when things could still get worked out at the convention instead of years in advance let 's have a good old democrat convention funny hats gay for pete buttons gretch for vp bunting from the wisconsin michigan delegation
what a load of horseshit if the dems pull this crap trump will win in a fucking landslide anyone else remember the election of 1984 it did not go well for our side
wait til you learn who beat donald trump in the last election
bull fucking shit he does
so fun fact people seem to be forgetting biden already beat trump already by a very sizable number dude still has a chance one debate is n't the end of the campaign will drop out of the news in a few days people will forget in a week memory is fun like that
lol some random joe interviewee on a podcast says its a race between hell no and oh no
it 's risky because the democrats could very easily pick someone less electable harris clinton ticket anyone
i ’m sick of this propaganda campaign trying to convince the public to pressure biden to step down my response is nahhh
trump is a twice impeached convicted felon he is also the presumptive candidate talk to me after he ’s on rikers he is not a candidate he ’s a caricature
this is the difference between liberals and the magas magas will vote and back their batshit crazy people no matter what they go to polling station and vote their candidates no matter how absurd that may be liberals on the other hand are flip floppers they are ready to jump the ship on the first sign of peril this is why trump might get his second term and liberals will be back to their in fighting
biden absolutely needs to step down he ’s handing trump victory after this debate swing voters are scared now
if you watched his campaign speech in nc just now you ’d feel a lot better trump pissed off a lot of people last night and joe took all the notes the american people threw at him fight like hell joe
it 's already over the dems blew it
i ’m not sure he will the problem with cognitive decline is well making poor decisions
joe was losing out of margin of error before this debate now he is even more so time to tune out of politics for the next 4 years
biden is n't going to drop out so discussing it is doing absolutely nothing to help defeat trump and protect the country and the world it is doing the opposite his rally in raleigh that just ended went very well
dumping biden now would be a bonehead move of the highest order you ca n't concede this to the right you dance with the one what brought ya
this is a bunch of russian nonsense joe biden is not going anywhere and he is going to demolish trump in november all this bed wetting about the debate is fueled 100 % by russian trolls we held a primary for 2024 and joe biden won in an absolute landslide it would be incredibly undemocratic if he was removed as the nominee people need to remember we are up against donald trump and voting for joe biden is the only way to save the country
there ’s absolutely no steam sure the people who do n’t want trump still do n’t want trump trump likely did n’t gain any votes but if anything biden likely caused more apathy and less to show up at the polls overall which is always bad for dems i ’d say biden increased his chances of losing by at least 25 %
he is the only one who can beat trump a new candidate guarantees a loss and a massive split in the party that will take years of not decades to fix
democrats are again negotiating against their own ghosts not one comment about the debate from the gop today not a peep they are just letting them have their pathetic public meltdown sad
these articles are weak ai n't nobody replacing biden ai n't nobody changing their mind to vote for trump biden will continue to crank out good policies while trump is trying to weasel out of court cases
bernie or aoc i ’ll settle for harris aoc
sure i 'll vote for joe biden not that it will mean much in the state of missouri which is why having biden as my candidate makes me feel so hopeless
this is n't really addressing the issue almost all of the people here who were going to vote biden before the debate will still vote biden now myself included we can still acknowledge however that he is a horrific candidate who gives us a poor chance of winning if he continues to look like one of the walking dead saying do you want more trump just sidesteps that conversation
most dems reading this will vote for biden again the problem is that several million that voted for him in 2020 wo n’t be
once again it ’s not about us it ’s about less engaged voters biden is n’t going to win after last night
my dude you do n’t have to convince me you have to convince everyone else who saw it last night and you are in for a rude awakening if you think shaming people is gon na g to get them to vote
your own conviction is n't the point it never was what matters are the swing voters that as of this morning have shifted the polls away from biden
i will vote for biden if i must but this moral grandstanding and browbeating does n't address the practical political concerns motivating calls for biden to step aside the question is n't who is the morally better option obviously if it 's biden v trump biden is the question is is biden politically capable of defeating trump in 2024 and is there another option that would make actually winning more likely those are two distinct questions one is an ethical question the other is a question of practical political considerations yes trump is a fascist and must be defeated that 's exactly why biden should step aside because contrary to the claim he is the likeliest candidate to win it is now manifestly true that he is a dangerous choice as he 's likely to lose as the article headline says switching is also risky but less risky to lose than biden remaining the democratic candidate he may even have been a decent president in terms of policy but he 's no longer a good politician electoral politics and governance are two distinct different things and you need to be a good politician to actually win
who s going to appoint them if it 's clearly not biden
but right now you push him to step aside not everyone pays attention like r politics commenters on a friday afternoon this might be the only thing they see until september or october and what they saw was a 5 alarm fire for this dudes competence or mental condition
drop biden or i do n't vote d it 's as simple as that biden is senile and does n't belong anywhere near the oval office
i just ca n’t vote for a dementia patient again i did it once i just ca n’t bring myself to stoop that low again
a younger and more vibrant candidate would be wonderful someone who is a moderate democrat would wipe the floor with trump bow out now joe
ditto red wave of 22
the media spent the entirety of 2020 saying biden would get trounced by trump no they did n't biden was favored to win nearly the entire race you can even go back and look at election forecasts like what world were you living in
a large number of people watched last night and decided they will vote against biden the other part here that seems to be rarely mentioned is that people might also just decide not to vote which will hurt biden more than trump right now the swing states have roughly 10 % give or take a few points of voters who claim they have n't decided on who they 're voting yet this does n't just mean they are picking between two people it also means they 're picking whether to vote or not biden has a slight lead in most of the swing states in the undecideds group usually about 3 % which could be just barely enough to tip those states in his favor but if even just a small group of that decide to sit out the election he wo nt remember that a many of the swing states in the last election were decided by less than 50 000 voters arizona and georgia each was less than 15 000 voters in those states ever vote absolutely does matter
i think the electoral fix was already in before this debate this one will be decided by the supreme court like 2000 this may be the last shot for the gop ghouls to rig everything they 'll try everything possible
latest poll in new jersey has big dick don winning by a point sony bmsu well be right fucking new jersey
the number of people saying “ well this does n’t change my vote ” do n’t know any swing voters anyone who is still a swing voter after seeing 4 years of both people as president is either a liar or fucking stupid
exactly i feel like people are in their own little bubble and do n't talk to trump swing and non voters if biden is the nominee trump wins
it ’s unlikely that america will elect a convicted felon
i 'm not voting for biden again not after last night
the people who will decide the election wo n’t think that way people need to get realistic quickly
oh you forgot trump has a chance to head to prison also
and a vp who i think could do a good job taking over if needed when not if she should really just be the one at the head of the ticket to begin with
this does n't matter to anyone who is still a swing voter i do n't know why people do n't understand this most non politically tuned people just saw the president brain turn into mash potatoes in a the first and probably only debate trump was already ahead before this and will certainly be ahead after all he has to do is say i 'm not wasting time on another debate with joe you all saw what happened and the race is effectively over
and if biden loses because he is no longer capable of performing one of the central necessary qualities of a candidate likely to win public speaking off the cuff without feeding into the credible perception of apparent senility then his whole team loses too i agree that biden is morally the better choice and i will vote for him if i must but electoral politics is about actually winning not losing with a smug moral victory practical political considerations demand that biden steps aside in order to increase the probability of democrats winning in november
vp has already been picked but not announced that was first broke live on nbc
hopefully that support system includes an emt and fuzzy good night slippers
sure sure figurehead but the biden revealed last night can not win
yeah someone who was n’t practically decomposing on stage in comparison to what we got last night
wait til you learn that biden 's approval ratings have gone south since the last election
by a sizable number nationwide in the battleground states it was barely enough is this enough to tip the scales towards trump i really hope there are not enough brain dead slobs out there who think trump will benefit them to actually vote for him but i doubt it
i ’m sorry but that ’s delusional he is n’t recovering from the optics
whitmer can easily she is under 70 for one
i doubt many people saw it which is why it wo n't matter
i watched it and am so beyond confused he was a totally different person in today 's speech
no please step aside joe so someone with lucid thoughts can defeat trump
the difference between a teleprompter and wit
no one watches campaign speeches it does n't matter how well he does in those the debates are often the only time voters hear the candidates in an unabridged unfiltered way
it is too late friend ca n’t erase what happened last night damage done it is over for biden
he sure got over that cold fast
i watched it he was reading from a teleprompter the whole time that is the difference
dems killing it in the senate races just need a new guy gal to send trump into oblivion
not true they just need to be honest about what ’s going on biden policies are not bad
especially after he was on point in today 's speech
if you watched it you ’d understand why
agreed trying to start over now would be a novel experiment in political gamesmanship now is now the time for novel experiments
interesting i love it just because of the username
just so you understand the argument they 're calling for joe biden to drop out voluntarily no one is calling for a democratic party coup where biden is replaced against his will lol
username checks out i did a giant “ lol ” when reading that dems held a primary for 2024 that was a good one
joe biden dominated the primary and will therefore demolish trump great logic
voting for any democrat will beat trump so maybe let ’s have one who is n’t a few breaths away from death
if you think he can win after last night i do n’t even know what to say it was historically tragic and the fog of denial needs to lift
he 's the only one who can lose to trump
yeah we desperately need someone even older to get in there
is there any dem that wins missouri in november
he 's already said he is n't stepping aside and my fear is that rehashing this is just going to dissuade voters at a time when we need people not just to vote but take someone along with them to vote
it 's gon na be 2016 turnout for biden except worse this time 3rd party split off from those who turnout will affect biden even worse than 2016
lol several million based on
they do n't want to hear that reality everyone is going to try to brush this under the rug and will then act shocked when november is a shitshow and he loses badly then finger pointing and infighting will start while the redhats start on a project 2025 speedrun everyone asks how nazi germany happened well gestures broadly
it ’s not about us it ’s about less engaged voters that 's where we come into play we have agency we can identify someone in our circle of friends or family who is not likely to vote and give them a ride or encourage them to vote it effectively doubles the power of our vote
there has not been a single poll released yet on the impact of the debates
sorta why the debate was so early it 's quite likely this debate wo n't mean much in 3 months that said 2024 will probably be the lowest turnout election since 2004
the spirit of defeatism cripples the wings of progress herbert hoover
your a die hard trump fan you would n't vote for biden under any circumstance
fivethirtyeight 's election forecast model is not the media they were n't the ones writing constant op eds about how biden was too old hiding in his basement and stood little chance of beating trump kind of like how their model currently favors biden to win but we 're still being bombarded with drop out joe articles today
here is the thing the dems really need to drive home the message that this will potentially be the end of the us as we know it if trump wins from his dictator comments scorched earth ’ plans and deportation camps ’ the man wants the world to end with him while he keeps doing what he wants his billionaire buddies do n’t think the collapse of the us will affect them but the global repercussions will hit them whatever the dems have to do even if it ’s forcing biden to step aside to let someone under retirement age step in also both trump and biden could die before november since they ’re in that age range imagine biden dies cuz old trump is super relieved since he gets to just waltz into the white house he believes in a few months most relaxed he ’s been since he left office the weird just retired ’ heart attack happens dead the man is surviving off of the duress he ’s under if that goes away the scramble from both parties would be insane or we ’ll just become full on russia 2 0 in a little over 6 months we ’ll see
i highly anticipate that very few people in ages 18 30 will not vote this election as compared to previous elections hence my claim trump will sweep the electoral college edit i think very few people ages 18 30 will vote i think a lot of young people will choose to stay home and stay out of politics
1 3 of eligible voters do n’t even vote i agree it should be an obvious choice but many people are unplugged from american politics and people are n’t aware of how dangerous that is
never underestimate the stupidity of the average american this was an unmitigated disaster for biden and i really do n’t think he ’ll be able to bounce back from it
yeah it was once unlikely that america will elect a game show host or a black man things do change americans do not value character nor substance these days
mtg is from georgia georgia is a swing state the united states will abso fucking lutely elect a convicted felon reddit is an echo chamber for the left and i like it because i believe a lot of what i see on reddit but it ’s not representative of how people vote
last night rattled me hard i know that trump is a dangerous fascist but i 'm having a hard time feeling like the dnc trying to shamble joe into a 2nd term is anything short of elder abuse this is terrible and i hate this timeline morally i feel like i 'm an asshole if i vote for joe and i worry about the karma that will circle back to me edit a word
so trump off to prison and us left with biden and how is that any good
the lady who did n’t even get one percent in the democratic primary no thanks we need an actually competent politician to run against trump
the amount of reality show drama he 's injected into just finding a vp that wo n't steal his spotlight or pull a jan 6th pence move should say a lot about him too
until trump campaign announces it it 's not real given his track record they could be lying and have no vp pick yet
during the primary debates people said joe was dead he was n't why does he shit the bed during debates no idea but he does
i 'm in the uk and it was televised here wish we 'd had that performance last night
many people may not see the full debate but there 's going to be a lot of people who see clips
undecideds in nc probably watched it and that ’s who matters
this is common in the elderly good days and bad days coherent oriented and emotionally stable in structured environments maybe not so much when things get chaotic the debate was chaotic biden already physically under the weather was trying to juggle what he wanted to say while also trying to process counters to the bullshit trump was throwing out there he short circuited overall this is n't going to get better he will have good days but as time goes by the circumstances under which he has good days will become fewer and fewer
its the difference between reading a prepared speech someone else wrote and winging it in real time only one of those require you to think on your feet much like the presidency
makes me wonder if the debate prep strategy was flawed did they try to fill him with too many facts did they try to make him go over every possible topic in too much detail biden looked best when he was confrontational tbh a lot of liberals want to see that a lot of liberals would rather see biden be blue maga or in more accepting terms dark brandon with quips and zingers and celebrating american accomplishments not trying to parse out specific details on topics the opportunity was there to say trump hates american prosperity and he did n't take it
no that is who he has always been reddit just has been denying it
he ’s been this way for many months you ’ve just watched edited sound bites and prepared teleprompter speeches that have made him look much better than he actually is i watch all media which is why i ’ve seen his low points as well
i ’m not super confused still seemed like an old man to me in the rally video the debate was at 9 pm if anything this just shows that biden is sundowning which is not good at all for anyone
until the republicans in each of those states sue and the supreme court says the republicans really won not much we can do then i think it might be too late already democracy is going to die
it ’s not about age it ’s about policy and ability
probably not i 'll vote for all of them but usually does n't matter i live in a pretty blue area but it 's been gerrymandered to where that does n't matter edit actually we should get at least a dem from kansas city and st louis areas ie cori bush
truman he 's kind of dead and not eligible but neither seems to be disqualifying now
they 'll need a lot more of the lucky caliscum that can escape that hellhole to flip more than the 2 cities y all can buy votes in funny seeing them move into mil property in the ozarks and then freak out when they see patriot point on a cruise better focus on destroying the farms like y all did throughout california if you wanta take over it 'll be harder for them to get their veggies from china compared to cali though
of course he 's said he is n't stepping aside does n't mean he should n't and does n't mean he wo n't that 's just the predictable thing for his campaign to say until the dust shakes out if he steps aside he will not say it until there 's some sort of plan in place but it may not be up to biden if donors and the dnc also make it clear they do n't believe he can win i doubt he will have much choice
if biden does n’t step aside and he has even one more showing like he did last night then his campaign is dead in the water average voters already find it hard to understand a lot of politicians it does n’t help when the politician ca n’t form a complete sentence without mumbling or mixing up words trump does n’t make sense when he talks either but he ’s confident about it that helps a ton the best case scenario for dems currently is to have biden step aside if so it needs to be done asap or somebody needs to figure out a way to make sure what happened last night does n’t happen again
it is not the people correctly saying that while biden may have been a good president in terms of policy the fact he is no longer a good politician makes it likely he will lose in november who will cause biden to lose saying the truth out loud is n't what will cause biden to lose it is his no longer being a good politician in itself that will cause him to lose not the people correctly saying so
my question is how the fuck did this guy gets more votes than obama
how do you convince someone to vote for biden after witnessing that debate it 's not enough to just shout at them that trump is worse
lol you ca n't talk somebody out of seeing an old man be trotted out and abused to protect the powerful behind the scenes no shot
oh ok when you see the proof then will you admit it
nyt this morning and you actually believe the remainder are going to show biden ahead following that performance really
that 's what scares me when people do n't vote conservatives win
lol that was hardly representative of the media dude 538 was absolutely representative of the media 's feeling towards the election outcome you can find op ed 's for literally any opinion the prevailing opinion was that biden was winning and trump was unfit
sweep the electoral college eh what odds would you give on that
i highly anticipate that very few people in ages 18 30 will not vote this election as compared to previous elections hence my claim trump will sweep the electoral college what are you saying that 18 to 30 year olds will mostly vote trump the polls do n't support that
total mandate many people are saying
this was an unmitigated disaster for biden and i really do n’t think he ’ll be able to bounce back from it i hate this country a bad debate and biden is n't able to bounce back from it but trump tried to overthrow a democratic election to stay in power stole over 100 classified documents and lied about it to the fbi was just convicted of business fraud less than a year after his business was found guilty of multiple financial fraud charges and is currently pending dissolution in the state of new york trump said he was going to be a dictator on day one and use the doj to go after political enemies and that still did nt ruin his aspects fuck this country
are suggesting voting for a black man shows a lack of substance what the fuck
reddit is an echo chamber of the softest and worst part of the left but there is more left left
who ya got in mind
she has a higher approval rating than biden and she 's virtually neck and neck with trump and has room to grow while he 's at his ceiling is harris the ideal choice no would she be the better choice than biden absolutely she has more charisma than clinton and post 2020 biden she would be more than able to deal with trump 's scattershot throw shit against the wall strategy and single out and fact check the lie that matters most probably most importantly she 's not uncomfortable with the topic of abortion biden is an octogenarian catholic man i 'm sure he 's pro choice in principle but it 's still a subject that visibly makes him deeply uncomfortable harris has no problem discussion abortion if she had given her and i 'm paraphrasing but this was the basic gist after birth abortions are conspiratorial nonsense what you 're describing is murder which is illegal and not sanctioned by the government late term abortions are extremely rare and only occur when the mothers life is in danger and if these mothers are forced to carry these pregnancies to term they not only risk dying from bleeding out it 's highly unlikely that the child will survive birth if it 's not already an unviable pregnancy answer that she gave to msnbc post debate then trump would have been destroyed make no mistake abortion is the most important issue that democrats are running on it 's something that 's no longer viewed as a taboo issue by the general public and a woman with stepdaughters who she loves deeply onstage debating a man about the facts and importance of safe and legal abortions creates a completely different dynamic
no it ’s just the media drawing up revenue it ’s been the norm a presidential nominee announces vp during the national conventions do n’t get too drawn on it because news is making a circus of it if you do n’t believe when was harris announced
per the norm of the past 30 years the vp pick gets announced during the national conventions
watch it be don junior or something lol i 'd howl if it was eric
he was an excellent debater when he was vp he was known for his debate skill in fact him looking shaky four years ago and worse now is evidence of decline not that he ’s somehow just not good at them
dude he was nothing like this in the last debates and you know it this is pure copium
people liked obama way more than biden romney or trump people fear hate trump more than they liked obama also growing populations
did i say otherwise i said nothing about proof or how i felt i said there are no polls yet post debate
nyt this morning you mean the one that was conducted prior to the debate but released today and you actually believe the remainder are going to show biden ahead following that performance they might not but they might clinton was polled as having winning the debates by large margins yet that obviously did n't result in her winning the election the absolute vast majority of voters already are decided polls put that at like 95 % or higher even fewer is the number of people who have said the debates will change their vote or help them decide the problem is that even if these debates change the split by 3 % that ca n't be accurately measured because the margins of error of these polls is larger than that you ca n't say biden drops by 2 points post debate from polls that have margins of error around 3 5 % that could also then just be a statistical swing because of the error so yes this debate might hurt biden and to your point i really would n't be surprised if it does but it will likely be too small to accurately measure
nyt this morning are you talking about their interviews with 6 voters
if biden does not drop out i would put 1 paycheck on donnie getting georgia penn florida arguably a swing state arizona and north carolina at a minimum
i think a lot of them wo n’t vote at all i hope i ’m wrong i ’m 26 and i ’m voting but i think a lot of people my age will look at both candidates and not even go to the polls
i m a democrat and hate almost everything the gop stands for but i think it ’s important people realize that contrary to reddit ’s belief most people do n’t pay attention to politics and there ’s a significant number of people that will make their decision based off something as dumb as one debate
oh this affects you too northern friend
literally antibody with a pulse who is n’t newsom or harris
funny people seem to forget the attacks on biden even back then
of course if you love our constitution biden stands for it trump ran a failed coup to destroy it that is still ongoing read house of putin house of trump
fair points but the population did n't grow that much
yes but you were clarifying in a way that devalued goddamnpeacelily 's point and i was n't having it
they might not but they might the fucking are n't it was a catastrophe
methodology 6 voters were polled at random margin of error is 40 %
no their national polling updated today
i do n’t think you know what sweep means
okay that is n't what your comment says though you said very few people will not vote
i m a democrat and hate almost everything the gop stands for then stop doing their job for them most people do n’t pay attention to politics and there ’s a significant number of people that will make their decision based off something as dumb as one debate people who do n't pay attention to politics is n't going to pay attention to a debate either
funny these articles have absolutely nothing to do with his debate skills he was known for gaffes back then not communication problems if you actually read the first article you ’d see that they mention his “ upcoming debate ” with paul ryan which he ultimately did very well in bury your head in the sand all you want but there is a huge problem here
the bar is 4 years lower he looks worse and a lot of voters are unhappy with his afghanistan ukrakne israel policy and also blame him for the economy
what was his point then he literally said that polls have shifted away from biden because of the debate which is false because there have been no polls released post debate
from the staff editor note on that page it will take a few days to see any impact on the polls from thursday night ’s debate some people watched the debate live but other voters ’ opinions will be shaped by clips and conversations in the coming days pollsters also need time to conduct robust and accurate surveys
yeah no way illinois california or new york would ever vote for trump even if there was no dem candidate trump would still lose in those states and therefore not get a sweep lol
ok i ’ll do an over under and say he wins more than half the swing states
if saying “ biden did a great job for 4 years but should bow out to a younger candidate ” means i ’m doing the gops work then so be it but i personally think refusing to consider biden lost the swing vote last night is doing the gops work
his gaffes you mean like when someone speaks there ’s more debates and he sounded fine in nc and last night after
side note support for ukraine is still high in the us aside form hardcore republicans who obviously would n’t vote for biden if their life depended on it
his point while inartful is that they surely will
missed that thanks for the clarification
that ’s no where close to a sweep of all states and really is n’t that bold of a prediction why not just say “ i predict he will win the election ” because by winning more than half of the swing states is how he ’ll do it regardless
yeah fair but his favorability took a serious hit with afghanistan and a smaller one after oct 7 people view him as weak and incapable
are you devaluing notcaffeinefree 's point because i wo n't have that
because this is reddit and people exaggerate
biden needs to stay one debate however much of an unmitigated disaster it was is not the entire story this is a rough day but there are more days ahead and biden still has a real chance at winning the infighting that would occur in the process of replacing biden will be more damaging to the party than this debate love him or hate him biden is who we have we can take him at his worst or we can get back the worst president in history that ’s our decision no matter how much we hate it biden is a good man and he loves his country and the people in it he still has my vote
if he goes there will be trouble
you give trump so much fuel if biden ducks and runs this is a show about confidence and strength the issues are only a small part of how the average jackass in america votes trust me on this
did biden roomba his way off the stage i missed the debate
yeah i do n’t know how the hell they are gon na deal with it because now nobody wants biden as a nominee and if they kick him out forcefully he wo n’t be happy with that and let ’s face it though it would have been better to do this crap years before now i believe that the democrat people who are saying that biden has to go is growing louder and louder and increasing in numbers and i would n’t be surprised if they secretly manage to evict him from the nomination behind closed doors and honestly if trump actually manages to get jail time that would be great but also not great i think that we could very well see a senate democrat coming out in favor of biden leaving soon and when that happens hoooooo boy
not worried he is very good leader
better to let him go then let him stay
it does n't matter anyway trump will be president
democrats strategy is we wo n't even try to improve the united states but at least we can say we 're better than republicans
they are more worried about losing power let the old man live his life and put someone else up
because they lack leadership they need to sack up and fall in line
who changes his poop filled diaper is it jill or nancy p
biden was losing the race before the debate he 's going to be massively behind now all trump has to do is avoid further debates and he 's your next president even if they replace biden there is n't a politician with the star power to win in the remaining time it 's a popularity contest so they 'd be better off finding someone popular and making them a politician instead of the other way around
if he stays it will be double
this is a show about confidence and strength biden exhibited neither of those at the debate last night when they were needed the most
how do you figure who could possibly replace him at this point and stand a chance in november
i truly hope that many people do n’t hate our country
do n’t act like trump was some sort of superstar last night trump literally danced around each of the questions and lied to an biden actually answered the questions hoarse voice or not besides considering trump is due to appear for his sentencing hearing soon he may not have much a chance to run the rest of the race but hey maybe the warden let him out for a few hours for good behavior as a treat
worried about what happens if trump gets power and how many will die and lives made irreparably worse as a result ftfy
they ’d never go within a foot of trump
so come on and let me know
as the journo who wrote this i can tell you this is definitely what i was going for landed better than my giuliani trial piece rudy can fail
either way it lead to devastation
exactly he needs to be replaced
no one the strategy for trump writes itself you refuse to debate whoever it is you spend your time painting them as a far left extremism who was installed against the voters will and keep whoever it is on defensive for 4 months as voter enthusiasm dies
1 biden is at 40 percent approval much less than 2020 2 biden barely won a few states in 2020 to win the election 3 biden is in worse place politically than he was in 2020 4 biden is polling bad in all swing states 5 biden will be in even worse position after this debate 6 so biden needs to step down
do n’t act like biden did n’t lie and performed well
yeah trump is going to let illegals kill our people and fund wars that will kill thousands
biden really ought to go
i ’m looking forward to your rock the casbah prompt
someone has clearly never listened to the clash
you 're still thinking of the president an old man highlighting a challenger 's youth and charisma will be enough to provoke a narcissist like trump that 's why you put the replacement in front of camera constantly trump could never let anyone else have the spotlight eventually his ego will demand there be a debate in order to protect itself from the unfavorable comparison
pretty much what people on this sub do n't get is the debate was meant to be a springboard for his low ratings the fact it went badly means his polling numbers in the 3 key swing states probably wo n't get better any time soon and it 's hard to see what would change the tide in his favour now at this point in time he 's likely to lose the electoral college against a convicted felon
how is ukraine or isreal bidens fault
trump has promised to put people in concentration camps and he wants to let russia roll over europe killing millions in their genocidal war to rebuild their empire but sure go on about the demographic group who does half as much crime as the average american does citing cato a right wing org btw
someone has clearly never listened to pokemon
biden is sending everyone billions of dollars to fund the wars i did n’t say they were his fault they started although you can argue his poor leadership allowed it to happen
trump has not promised that you made that up and russia did n’t roll over europe during his presidency you made that up too illegal immigrant crime should be zero is the point we can compare apples to oranges all you want but we should n’t let criminals into our country
trump would just let putin take ukraine against their will ukraine wants to be independent from everything russian and they do n't want to be part of russia
trump has not promised that you made that up and russia did n’t roll over europe during his presidency you made that up too they want to which is why they 're so very keen on cutting funding for ukraine you really think if we do as trump wants and pull out of nato they 'd stop with ukraine they want the entire soviet empire back illegal immigrant crime should be zero is the point we can compare apples to oranges all you want but we should n’t let criminals into our country why are you so afraid of brown people
trump was president for 4 years and it did n’t happen so what do you mean “ would ”
i ’d say wanting to deport illegals that are stealing from social security and killing americans is different from mass murder did russia invade ukraine under biden or trump i ’m not afraid of brown people but make it about race if you want
he is buddies with putin also he claimed he would solve the war in ukraine in a day i e giving putin full control
some key points 60 % thought trump performed the best 21 % thought biden performed the best 19 % did n't know who performed the best changes in support biden 48 2 % 46 7 % trump 43 5 % 43 9 % kennedy 17 3 % 18 4 %
a drop of 1 5 % in support might seem small for biden but could be a difference maker come the election if this is representative of the population at large
the guy who won just stood up there spewing lie after lie and hateful vitriol towards immigrants we are such a sad country
not cnn the ratings were down over 30 %
nobody won that “ debate ” biden is old and clearly not a night owl trump is old and clearly sleeps during the day usually in court or while he ’s supposed to be “ working ”
the only “ win ” is it happened before the convention and official nomination there ’s still time to make a change before it ’s too late anybody who says anything else is gaslighting you and unfortunately there ’s a lot of that going on in here right now
trump was less bad he was who he always had been biden legit validated all concerns about his health and age
at this point joe needs to step aside
trump most certainly did n't win this we all lost to include him
pretty much makes it look like a wash yeah voters think biden did worse but they do n't think trump did well ether and he probably has something of a soft cap on his support because well he 's trump so he did n't really pick up any support issue is biden still needs to assuage those concerns about his age to be in the clear and that 's become harder
rereading the transcript of the debate and ignoring news outlets and bidens sleepiness tbh i think biden did win if you solely look at the whole transcript
can someone explain why there was a debate before the nominees are declared at their conventions are we not still in the primaries even if the candidates are known
undoubtedly trump did because of biden
well 60 % said trump won and only 20 % said biden won just about as lopsided as expected however the silver lining is that somehow biden 's favorability among likely voters went up and trump 's went down do n't know if i trust that result with so little time since the debate and the general state of polling but it 's not as bad as i feared at least
and if there was any silver lining from the debate for biden this was it the face off does n’t seem to have caused many people to reconsider their vote that said biden did lose a small share of potential voters post debate 46 7 percent of likely voters said they were considering voting for him which was 1 6 percentage points lower than before the debate note that this was not a straight horse race poll respondents could say they were considering voting for multiple candidates trump 43 5 % to 43 9 % after the debate third parties 17 3 % to 18 4 %
seems a little premature to measure the impact on the race less than 24 hours in i think it will take some time for non viewers to see the outtakes and the full effects to set in
it depends on whether you prefer a slow old decent guy or prefer a more energetic old convicted felon
trump was able to present his nonstop lies very well he also threw in some dogwhistle racism for the bigots in the crowd unfortunately that s all it takes with some people so yeah trump won
so even with a poor performance pretty much no change
depends do you want a very worn out old man with good intentions or a deranged old man felon and rapist
anyone could have replaced either candidate and won that debate
what worries me the most is that these two senile old men are the best options the us has to offer
nobody won it biden lost it
real median income 2019 78 250 2022 74 580 st louis fed
trump did but we got lied to trump lied about his record and what he plans to accomplish and biden lied about being able to handle another 4 years of this
trump was also the clear winner of the debate when we asked debate watchers to directly compare the two candidates ’ performances sixty percent said that trump performed best while only 21 percent said biden performed best nineteen percent said they did n’t know
538 's poll shows the needle barely moved which is as best as we can hope for its probably hard to be undecided right now most people either know who they are voting for or just wo n't vote that said i truly hope biden and his campaign can get it together this was a huge and avoidable misstep
trump won relative to expectation but also did n't do well and lied and said completely crazy shit so i think it will wash out over the next few news cycles
objectively trump won the first half by default biden won the second half
nothing changed for trump while biden came away with his own party questioning his candidacy so i ’d say biden lost and the american people lost
trump clearly won binden 's performance was n't just subpar it was alarming to the point of people having legitimate talks about a replacement
watching trump pull his punches out of sheer pity was truly astonishing don by a landslide
yep in a country of 330 million these are the two choices we have a blustering narcissist and an old man clearly suffering from early to mid stage dementia
lol that 21 % must all be reddit politics coping hard
the biggest takeaway for me was that trump 's support only edged up a tiny bit after 8 years of wall to wall political coverage and 40 years in the pop culture zeitgeist everyone knows what donald trump is all about a 2 hour debate is not enough to change people 's minds on him
21 % is a respectable showing for biden everything considered
if it does n't regress back to the mean which i think it will to clarify trump will inevitably find a way to make a major vermin bloodbath etc gaffe before the election
when your opponent is unable to articulate his position it does n’t take much you can not run a candidate who a large part of the public believes has dementia
biden lied all night long too
the beltway won online the reaction was a lot more of they both sucked and neither won in normie circles not dc elitists than trump absolutely won msm consensus in their groups i do n't know who could see that and say biden won though honestly but trump 's performance was nothing good enough for him to leave a real impact he botched it himself by turning in something very mediocre
i was n't watching that shit i saw maybe 4 minutes in total and most of that was filled by the felon lying about stupid shit debates are pointless
i think that does n’t capture streaming viewers so meaningless
trump ’s support meanwhile barely budged perhaps a reflection of the fact that while biden performed poorly on thursday night voters were n’t especially impressed with trump ’s performance either the share of likely voters who said they were considering voting for trump after the debate climbed from 43 5 percent to just 43 9 percent yeah it did n't do much of anything net wash out overall with a week or two mmw when this is out of sight out of mind shortly nothing moved the needle in a big way for biden though in his direction which is what he needed to say the least biden only took on slight water was n't anything good for biden but trump was n't exactly good either is what they thought
nothing like having super delegates further erode the voice of the people by not giving us a say in the candidate
trump did n’t drop out after he was caught making comments about grabbing women by their genitalia he did n’t drop out after openly mocking the vulnerable he did n’t resign after calling our military “ losers ” and “ suckers ” he did n’t resign after he was impeached twice he did n’t resign after his criminally negligent mismanagement of the pandemic he did n’t resign after his failed insurrection he did n’t drop out after being criminally indicted four times he did n’t drop out after being held civilly liable for rape and fraud he did n’t drop out after being convicted by a jury of 34 felonies so yeah tell me more about why biden should drop out after one bad debate
which 99 99 % of voters would never do
if you ignore all the bad stuff he actually performed very well fascinating insight
the polls showed things as basically deadlocked i think there was a desire by the campaigns to shake up the race that was n’t a good idea for biden
the two candidates have both won their primaries though they have n’t been formally nominated which happens at their party conventions it ’s not unusual to have debates after the candidates win primaries but before the conventions i think
oh no regardless of which one of them performed better the us won nothing
biden did n't even fend off his lies with facts he was just like no you
please stop saying it barely moved biden lost 1 5 % of likely voters in that poll that 's huge in a tight race
eh other than the media and political pundits does anyone really care i ca n't recall a presidential debate ever having any sway on my vote
biden took the trophy of lies and completely crazy nonsensical shit
it 's 4 months until the election if you 're still undecided on whom you 're going to vote for and need a debate between two octogenarians to help you decide you 've got pudding for brains debates are for ratings
but it did n’t result in people being more likely to vote for him or less likely to vote for biden
biden ’s only goal was to take attention off his age and keep the spotlight on trump ’s disastrous persona he failed miserably at this he had chances to jump on trumps bs and missed them all this was an unmitigated disaster
the copium in this sub is insane there was n’t a winner biden lost badly
do n't forget the other guy aka the one whose worms ate his brain pulling up the rear in a distant third 21 % are triple haters this election who disapprove of all 3 as trivia
jeb wants biden to step down please clap
yeah a lot of copium here today not saying he ’s done for or anything there is a lot of time but anyone saying he did well is lying to themselves or deaf and blind
sure he will but how many gaffes will biden have by then
how many lies did he spout at the debate over 30 says right wing cnn
not even close to the same frequency as trump and you should know better than to compare the two in that respect
for a change trump was very disciplined and acted presidential i think the cnn rules ended up helping him out tremendously not having a crowd and not being able to interrupt kept away his worst impulses
biden ’s performance cooled so much of his base while it did the opposite for trumps base it ’s an election that ’s going to be won by the enthusiasm of each base as well who can swing that crucial independent vote that polling seems to miss so often after last night does anyone have even the slightest bit of confidence biden gained ground with the independents or that he energized his base
trump did n’t win biden lost badly
not like we had a say in this primary cycle to begin with lol
you 're forgetting that republicans have no shame
biden is going to lose his base and then the election that 's why none of those things affect trump 's base
because americans as well as people around the world watched who is supposed to be the leader of the free world not be able to convey a coherent thought again undecided voters already know biden 's accomplishments as well as trump 's faults and if they 're still on the fence after those seeing biden 's cognitive decline is n't going to win them over
so you think biden should follow trump 's lead and cling to power instead of stepping down for the good of the country surely one of the things that makes biden better than trump is that he 's not that arrogant and selfish
trump is literally one of the worst human beings alive and i ’m tired of being told that anything above that standard should be accepted with open arms yes biden is better than trump should he be running for president absolutely not
because he is behind in the polls and needed this debate to change the trajectory
because after a debate like that there is no reason for trump to accept another one trump did n't drop out because his constituents do n't care about his moral shortcomings i care about being lied to when biden says he is going to be my president when it 's obvious he is going to die very soon my grandmother died of natural causes at 93 and sounded and acted just like joe biden did last night
that ’s the longest but trump i ’ve seen in a while now
i mean biden ’s cognitive abilities are extremely questionable it is n’t just this debate people have been talking about joe possibly having dementia for a while at least since 2020 this is n’t about biden vs trump it is about the most powerful person in the world not being able to function at the highest levels of leadership
because it 's teflon don not teflon joe
if spewing unrelated bullshit is winning then i guess he did
i watched the debate with subtitles on eventually i just muted it
read the wrong title i ’m stupid
its a fucking poll if it went down 10 points i would be worried
maybe you could believe that if you only watched the first 5 minutes
biden had pudding for brains last night
there ’s no way to know this 18 hours after the debate ended lmao
your own article shows that he lost 1 5 % support between pre and post debate it did make people less likely to vote for him and that was n't even with today 's news cycle in mind and the ripple effect to people who were n't watching
may have more to do with the sample the pre post election preferences for this cohort was 55 45 biden where a lot of pre debate polling of independents give trump a similar margin
eh i voted for biden once and wo n't do it a second time
it was bad but trump gained a whopping 0 4 % from it which is nothing aka the race is not going to move in an appreciable way toward him which is what he needed to put biden away his performance was not above average or excellent and was average is what they thought biden took only 1 6 net water but he has more still considering they 'd vote for him than trump or rfk at around 46 7 % so it was n't a horrid enough performance to keep him out for the count but it was not what he needed to do period poor i bet the race goes back to the norm in 2 3 weeks which means biden 's fantasies and harris etc about the sun belt need to go away as it 's coming down to the rust belt period whoever wins michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin will be the next potus
biden lost indeed as a non american the media here from left to right is talking about replacing him we were shocked by the performance and it 's better to say that after a career of 50 years it 's better to retire
which means trump won or at the very least is the main beneficiary of biden ’s performance which is just a roundabout way of saying he won
he had countless in 2020 no one cared they wo n't now on that front long term does n't look like it changed anything much which is not what biden needed
this is just false i doubt you can point out 3 objective lies on trump side not metaphors or anything while biden was just rambling nonsense
in the first half he went back to his usual fare in the second half and i think that prevented trump from making an impact fortunately for biden
not badly enough to lose a real chunk of those considering him it was like from 48 to 46 7 but it did not help him obviously his fantasies about sun belt states sans nv az need to be put to rest at this point
why would biden lose his base when the alternative is a criminal dictator
yup the gop is a cult the democrats are not and still hold their politicians to something resembling standards
i 'd much rather have the guy with the raspy voice pick the next two supreme court justices than the guy who got roe v wade overturned
ah i did n't realize there was another red wave
youtube streams did nt even allow for subtitles the cbs one i was using
true i did n’t notice that
i 'm skeptical of polls too so i 'm with you that this single poll is n't something to be that worried about i just want people to know the facts
we watched the whole thing and the panic on the faces of the pundits afterwards both cnn and wp recapping the whole thing was hilarious to watch they were all like “ top democrats and donors are calling for him to step down ” some dude on cnn was like i love him but he did terrible i think that guy was on cnn trump lied no doubt but so did biden it comes down to performance and trump won that category hands down
my are n't you a clever doofus
they did a poll pre debate and then polled same people post debate change was negligible
that ’s within the margin of error and yes of course it could change but it could change in either direction
right if 1 5 % flip over and vote for trump in every swing state trump will win in an absolute electoral landslide
we ’ll see of course but its too soon to really assess the outcome from this
i hope you re right but not optimistic
i like your qualifiers or attempts at them anyway
disagree trump absolutely won that debate
that 's huge when the race will be decided by a few percentage points
because people do n't like electing leaders who are mentally incompetent that 's why they 're not going to flip to trump they 're going to stop donating and stay home on election day
you and me both but the fear now is that biden ca n't win and if he stays in the race we will be stuck with trump i prefer the third option biden drops out and we choose a more electable candidate to go against trump
i do n’t think a 2 man contest is dependent on any waves it ’s either or
trump sounded and looked like a raving lunatic at various times i think they both did poorly
i think no one cares after a few weeks and it goes back to the usual it 's been pretty stable and trump did not do what he needed to do to capitalize on this either
that goes both ways give it just one news cycle and the few people that pretend last night mattered will move on to something else
who is to say that small margin does n't revert back though with months to go prior to this event trump had at one point in 2023 almost a 4 pt lead on biden but it kept shrinking down to 1 2 % in early 2024 and is now down to a dead heat with biden or trump trading off 1 % leads basically in averages lately if this debate were in october toast since it 's in june biden will still hang in there but he 's got a 50 50 shot period in nov now he ca n't win a lot of the states he won in 2020 in 2024 period so needs to be very careful and strategic to win and focus on only those he 's actually competitive with trump in
no fear about that 3rd option failing and blowing up the dnc
not really trump spoke well clear and loud turning the mics off really benefited trump kept good posture the whole time biden look feeble weak and unsure went on weird tangents spoke like he remembered a script not passionate at all compared to trump biden lied about receiving support from the border patrol union and they later tweeted that they in fact do not support biden
there is no good option now but after last night the feeling has to be that running biden is gon na result in a loss obviously a swap out at this point can be perceived as nothing else except a panic move but if the alternative is a guy you ’re almost certain is gon na lose then you do it they ’re supposed to have the smartest media and pr people in the world working for them maybe they can figure a way to make people think it was a good thing but the longer you wait the harder it will be 5 months is almost half a year if they did it quickly
not really no democrats have been overperforming in midterms and special elections in large part thanks to high turnout from younger voters all they need to do to win is run someone who has no glaring flaws someone who is n't actively repellent to millenials and the election is in the bag
i mean no i do n't expect the dnc to have the smartest media and pr people in the world working for them those people work for some corporation hahah they gave jamie harrison the top dnc job and he 's never won an election he just fundraised like hell but i guess that 's what is needed for the job
our only hope is that voters realize that democracy is n't a fantasy movie
it 's extremely sad to see democrats not even try here 's an analogy trump is an arsonist and biden is a geriatric firefighter it 's stupid for a fire department dnc to just sit around and say hey our geriatric firefighter is still better than the arsonit no shit you 're part of the problem because you should be training up younger firefighers
nobody knows who she is and there is n't a lot of time to learn
when the biden team sees those polls with dwindling numbers in michigan wisconsin georgia and nevada they will change their minds or they will live with the legacy of our lost democracy for the rest of their natural lives this result will rest with biden
replacing an incumbent potus who fairly won every primary by large margins with 130 days to go before the election because of one bad debate performance is some truly unhinged deep lanyard shit everybody needs to chill the fuck out passing over the black woman vp to nominate a white woman most people have never heard of will rightfully piss of black voters and that will assure a trump win more than anything else like it or not biden is the guy so either lock in or shut the fuck up
lol ok i 'm voting not trump in this election but in what universe is this woman our savior
whitmer is definitely running for president in 2028
it must be me but i think she 's hot ticket to be first female us president
this country will not elect a woman
i hope everybody in the democratic party will lose their jobs to have a new wave a leaders come in
changing the candidate 4 months out would be the dumbest move ever and i 'm pretty sure the dnc is super cool with joe being on the ballot still
i think some combination of newsom whitmer would work she would offset the “ ewww california ” affliction that most of the country seems to suffer from they ’re both charismatic young and look like movie stars
changing candidates just bails out donald trump his kryptonite is boring old white guys
whitmer has come out in support of the president i love whitmer i voted for her when i lived in michigan and i ’ve even pre ordered her book but now is not the time biden had a horrible debate but that one debate is n’t who he is and there is plenty of other evidence that shows that dems need to rally behind biden and for once give him the unwavering support he deserves after putting up with all the bs he has had to in order to keep power away from the fascists biden is n’t perfect biden is far too old he ’s also the man we need to win and we need to wake up to that now this is n’t time for another 2016
i ’m not a fan of biden ’s performance but i would vote 3rd party over her hell i ’d prefer taking my chances with biden or bernie
gretchen whitmer liz cheney will shut project 2025 down and take control of putin and kim you would have to be a fkn idiot not to think the traitor president and other republicans have had something to with ukraine north korea and russia the threat of wwiii is real and upon us i would like to hear what she has to say about project 2025 she is on the record stating that a republican house majority in 2025 would be a threat to american democracy she is in total disagreement with today 's republican party she will make putin kim and netenyahooo shit themselves first democratic leadership needs to be removed they have made too much money the past 3 years and have done nothing to prevent where we are at today
stop she is n’t running nor would she win in 2024 she is planning for 2028 but also a woman does n’t have a chance in this election sorry
it is n't a fantasy to want a president who is mentally sound
it ’s an old code but it checks out
biden looked great today in nc full of energy and vigor and i do n’t want to hear that he ’s reading from a teleprompter that ’s what a president does it ’s a job requirement to read from a teleprompter and biden does it well and after seeing biden today i do n’t care that he fumbled his words last night that could have happened for a variety of reasons him being sick and zonked on medication or the different format or that he over prepared at camp david during a solid week of prep who knows why but it can happen to anyone and we ’ve seen it happen to candidates a lot younger than biden it was one debate sure we all wish it would have gone better hell biden wishes it had to he even said as much today but it did n’t and it ’s over so we move forward put it behind us and keep going with the same purpose and goal we had before the debate ever happened beat trump and biden is still the best shot we have to do that so now is the time to rally around biden not look for alternatives biden has beat trump once and if we stand with him he ’s going to beat trump again
yes at some point every responsible democrat needs to sunset their idealistic goal of voting for the president they 'd like and vote for the one they have to
right everyone is saying trump will end democracy but democrats are doing their part in it too complacency by the dnc is the exact same kind of complacency by people who do n’t both end up with trump being elected
does n’t really matter dems only need to win 3 states all in the midwest wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania in all 3 of those states i like her odds better than biden ’s
i 'm from mi if you do n't know who she is it would be worth looking she 's been amazing for our state and would be great for the country but not until 2028
four months is plenty of time
that a good thing because a generic democrat polls great against trump we also have the internet now barnstorming is n’t what it used to be if you want to emphasize womens healthcare and right wing radicalism whitmer is an excellent choice
nah that ’s big gretch throw some respect on her name
primaries are long past it would be completely against the principles of democracy to just appoint her
yup it 'll absolute tank dems even more with people of color no one knows the governor outside her state which maybe she could carry not sure that means all the rust belt though as a big caveat as michigan is not necessarily pennsylvania or wisconsin identical trump will just attach her to biden regardless and fauci covid shrine praise etc etc the dems in power either ride with biden or sink with biden at this point they 've been his staunchest advocates the last 4 years across the board thus none is exempt from his record accordingly trump the gop will use it on any d period
picking a candidate because of their race biden won his primaries because almost nobody primaries the incumbent his primary results are irrelevant to the conversation especially true when the apparent nature of his mental decline was n't as obvious before yesterday
i 'm not sure about kamala 's popularity amongst african american voters you give her too much credit besides not sure where does all this aggressiveness come from i merely shared an article
the perspective above is the held by the people in charge that lead us to this point wo nt be listening to insular incompetence when it comes to the path forward anymore
hahaha you think last night was the first issue funny how regarded people here can be
great point about the optics of kamala being passed over for a white woman plus there is simply no time for candidates to campaign against each other for delegate votes this is why even in a wild scenario where biden bows out it has to be kamala not newsom not whitmer
the vp simply does n’t resonate with black voters politico polling repeatedly shows her even less popular than joe
black people do n't give a shit about cop mala
democrats do n’t know how to close ranks and protect their candidate ever since obama they let hilary get thrown to the wolves in 2016 the only reason for the upset in 2020 was covid and that people associated biden with obama stop embarrassing the country get your people in line we are a couple months out from deciding the fate of the nation
she ’s big gretch enough said
not if biden wins dies and kamala is sworn in then we will hear the same trope about how important incumbency is
well a black man seemed even more unlikely and it did n't turn out bad
not sure how other midwest great lakes states are but i know a lot of people in ohio where i live think whitmer is a nutjob ohio is more red than pennsylvania michigan wisconsin minnesota but she ’d need those states and i do n’t know how she ’d do outside michigan
my sentiments exactly i honestly believe that ticket would be extremely solid
yeah he really looked inhibited by it last night
she has done well in michigan could have a better chance with the midwest states than biden or newsom why are you so sure
really what assurances do you get with biden that you do n't get with her yours is a very unpopular opinion from what i 've read today on reddit
she would landslide trump even if she ran as an independent we are given two non choices on purpose
biden is mentally cooked harris is not well liked at all less so than biden sanders is older than biden newsome 's california is constantly dragged and just my harsh opinion he looks like a tool easy homerun for trump whitmer is by far the best choice and from a swing state
if mentally sound is your goal then whitmer is not your candidate
biden is still the best shot we have to do that sadly i do n't agree with this anymore
it feels like biden is still the best shot we have has been the rote justification used to shut down any kind of debate for the last two years ignore the approval numbers biden is still the best shot we have against trump ignore the polling biden is still the best shot we have against trump no we ca n't even consider any other candidate biden is still the best shot we have against trump so what if he would be the oldest presidential candidate ever biden is still the best shot we have against trump maybe some of his foreign policy decisions really alienate a lot of younger voters but biden is still the best shot we have against trump and damn anyone who wants to ask are you sure because it really does n't look like he 's the best shot we have
he was reading off a teleprompter that is a low bar my friend i ’d like to see him answer questions with coherence but yes he can still read words
because god forbid the democrats ever have to put forth a good candidate or hell just one who can handle an unscripted public speaking event nope it 's all on the voters to have to just hold their nose and go with whatever bone gets tossed to them at least he 's not trump
that ’s just the thing on a debate stage they ’d be at the wings they ’re both terribly unpopular outside their states and their states are both fiscal and economic disasters
all in the midwest pennsylvania
and she is keeping true to her promise to “ fix the damn roads ”
except the fact that it ’ll be too late to save anything but yeah point taken
absolutely nobody pays attention to the presidential race in a typical year until september anyway obviously this year has been a bit different there ’s plenty of time and there is not going to be some unknown opposition research fact on her she has been well vetted and attacked by the right for years now
i agree to a point elections are when you are actually voting for president primaries are state sponsored voting for private organizations those organizations can change their rules how they want but in the end you still get vote for or against them on election day but it ’s definitely not preferable or a good look also what if joe died or stepped down instead having a terrible debate performance there would be no time for another set of primaries and the dnc would pick the candidate regardless i do want to see how he recovers from the debate before wanting him to be replaced
that 's not how this would work biden is the only person who can make the decision to withdraw from the race if he did his elected delegates would be free to vote for whoever it would be overwhelmingly hardcore biden supporters voting for the next nominee
i definitely love losing everything i care about just so i can have that righteous high ground
i think the method would have to be that biden steps out and whitmer would win in a brokered convention it 's extremely unlikely but neither trump nor biden have officially been nominated yet
there is no just appoint process if biden releases his delegates then they would be free to vote for anyone at the convention including whitmer to be the nominee whoever gets 50 % 1 support possibly requiring multiple rounds wins the nomination if biden does not release his delegates he won almost all of them in the primaries then they must vote for him and he becomes the nominee
she 'd still have to win the election to become president she would n't be granted any powers without the majority of voters agreeing with her
saying biden fairly won the primaries when his biggest opponents were marianne williamson and rfk jr puts more weight to that accomplishment than it deserves
i do n't disagree that he 's way too old but i do disagree with the notion that one bad debate performance negates a solid three years of competent leadership in which the economy is doing fairly well most people have more money in their pockets than before the west is unified and respects us and that pulling lebron out with 5 minutes left in the fourth quarter when you 're down by 10 points is the right call
how dare you post things
if your honest perspective is that dems will push the incumbent potus out who won the votes of tens of millions of democratic voters throughout the primary season so he can be replaced by sen johnny unbeatable d candy mountain at the very last minute then go to bed it 's a school night
kamala is the relatively quiet vp of a relatively unpopular administration so opinions of her are influenced by opinions of biden meaning they are malleable also please talk to black voters and you would see how very wrong that take is or just lurk in black spaces like the shade room to get an idea of how bad of an idea passing over kamala would be
literally no black people call her that only ever heard white bernie supporters use that word to describe her and it 's not so much that they 're huge kamala fans just that the optics of passing over the black woman vice president are extremely bad and the black community would remember that snub in november
and you speak for black people
true it just seems like now she ’s setting herself up to take on that responsibility
my thought there is that the people who think she ’s a nutjob probably would n’t be voting for biden either idk i live in california and no matter what people say about it they need to remember that there are more trump voters here than in any other state
oh come on ohio people hating on michigan is as old as football
i guess you do n’t remember trump going after his previous female opponent
this late if the primary candidate is replaced it tells the voters that she is there for face value and the original ship of biden has sailed no one wants to vote for a consolation prize every one wants to be the part of champions league
replacing someone before the election is unheard of and would most likely hand trump the victory
i ca n’t support someone who will set rules for others while ignoring them herself
i 100 % disagree trumpers will not go for her he has 37 38 % vote locked up that leaves 62 % left she ’d have beat biden with a huge swath of republicans and independents by 40 22 not happening many of those will vote trump she would n’t win again misogyny is well and alive in the us
good points there are five months left plenty of time imo we shall see come convention time
sanders is older than biden sanders still has all of his mental faculties intact he is well known and he is what all voting americans wants
whitmer polled worse against trump than newsom and far worse than harris and biden
you sure about that would be great if he could speak in complete sentences that 's a good start
i understand why you and others feel this way i was doubtful after last night myself but then i saw him speak today and had a chance to look at things in perspective the big picture and i realized that it was n’t the end of the world biden is the same biden we ’ve had for four years the same biden people have been calling too old for four years the same biden who has proved those people wrong time and time again so i ’m not ready to throw in the towel on old joe biden just because of one debate let the republicans think he ’s too old let them get complacent let us be the underdog in this fight people love rooting for the underdog
exactly we have shot ourselves in our foot to begin with there has to be more than beating trump and that was what all last election was about
even from across the aisle it 's been kind of obvious that people keep hiding behind excuses not to replace biden
as john oliver pointed out being better than trump can not be the standard because donald trump is the absence of standards
unironically yes voters must do that
i ’d love to watch a trump newsom debate gavin did n’t do well against desantis and cali is 100x worse now soon more people will be homeless than not in california the stats will be hilarious for trump to recite
yeah i guess “ rust belt ” is probably more accurate
just because the system is undemocratic does n't make it right
can i be an elected delegate
does a regular person get a say no sounds undemocratic
yeh seems that way the dems fumbled this bag
pulling lebron out with 5 minutes left in the fourth quarter when you 're down by 10 points in this analogy we just found out that lebron ca n't see straight after taking a blow to the head it 's not his fault and in better circumstances he 'd be a great player but he ca n't play like he did in the first quarter
i was nt aware it was november the only logical perspective is that biden has to go he can not win and last night was the nail in the coffin people have been pushing for the past several months this is curtain being pulled on the wizard of oz levels of devastating if you ca n't see that then you are the only person who needs to go to bed
the incumbent could barely form a sentence if you missed that part he was looking out into space like he had no idea where he was he 's got ta go
is this the exception to vote blue no matter who i 'm sure they would feel snubbed and vote for trump instead
i do n't project my pre conceived notions onto them based off of the race of a particular candidate
most of them probably not but adding that to the ones who just do n’t know anything about her i dunno in order to have a chance if the democrats would switch candidate at this point they need to absolutely knock it out of the park i do n’t know who would fit that bill honestly
true although i ’m actually more of a michigan than ohio state fan
the one where he lost every debate and barely squeaked out a win because his opponent was so massively unlikable and had a few scandals of her own
policy matters it would tell voters “ this is the best person to carry our platfor i ’d be honored to vote for whitmer as would many others
running someone as old and infirm as biden is unheard of and would most likely hand trump the victory
having two candidates this old is also unheard of as is having a major party candidate who 's a felon a lot of people have been distinctly unenthused about this biden trump matchup tossing someone new into the race could actually work in our favor
we are so far into unheard of territory already one candidate is a convicted felon both candidates are older now than even reagan at the end of his term both candidates have deeply negative approval ratings this is only the second time a former president has run against an incumbent i do n't think anyone has a clear sense of what 's going to happen either way
i think biden supporters would gladly vote for her or almost anybody that is n't trump and she could have a stronger hold with the independents in mi pa and wi where biden has been polling behind consistently most of the comments in reddit are people complaining about biden 's age and begging for a replacement i do n't think 4 months is n't enough time considering she 's already known in the states that matter
biden is already doing that
so your whole point of contention is that she gathered at a restaurant with friends after imposing the covid lockdown if that 's enough to turn you then you probably wo n't find anyone to vote for newsom cheated on his wife biden used to be a warmonger during the iraq years next to these whitmer 's deeds seems like child 's play
it 's a nonstarter to sub out a guy because of mental decline for an even older guy
he is what all voting americans wants that 's a take
sanders had a heart attack on the campaign trail he never stood a chance anyways but he will never be elected president at his age
because right now people do n't know who she is
30 m saw last night not even 300k will see today
at his very best he ’s still not the same biden as when he took office in 2021 which was n’t the same biden as when he exited as vp in 2017 i ’m one of the 40 % that approve of his job performance and have been defensive about his age related concerns last night revealed his cognitive issues are real far worse than most of us imagined and almost certainly progressive he ’s simply not at a point in his life where anyone in good conscience can argue he should be president until 2029
in all fairness last night he was not reading off of cards or teleprompters i noticed him looking down quite a bit which is a sign of under confidence in public speaking
you know what i had an aha moment when you said something about trump 's maga cult followers getting complacent this might be a bit of a far fetched hunch but the early timing and shotty performance of this debate on biden 's part might have been part of the plan all along i mean why would biden and his team decide to set up a debate with trump if they thought he was n't entirely confident why would he do this if he thought this would be shooting himself in the foot none of this really adds up the strategy may be to let biden appear like the weak and worn old man that the media speculated he is and purposely get the democratic party all riled up and panic to feel like the underdogs earlier in the election cycle provide biden and democrats with enough time to recover but also enhance that sense of urgency and panic they all felt in 2020 and 2022 let trump keep exposing the liar and narcissist he really is now i do believe biden really is n't as sharp as he was and he definitely is n't the same person prior to 2020 really that just comes with age but i also do n't believe that he is the dementia patient that many pundits paint him as if my memory serves me right the main reason why democrats lost so much in 2016 is this notion of complacency and inevitability they had with hillary voter turnout was quite low at all levels same thing with the 2010 and 2014 midterms where the public expected to see change without really participating in it because there was this sense of complacency that obama alone will set things right i know this sounds like copium but i believe this whole strategy was concocted in secret by biden the top brass of his cabinet and his inner circle multiple sources state that he 's had private meetings days leading up to the debate regarding campaign strategy with obama and some other key figures i just find it a bit odd that none of the key figures not even bernie is bashing and dissuading biden after his bad debate hopefully biden co know what they are doing to ensure a victory over trump
john oliver and his 10s of millions will be just fine either way biden has helped millions of the non rich and famous grown the economy imperfectly yet better than almost all other countries on earth better than trump is absolutely the standard in reality instead of west wing fan fic
when voting in a primary or caucus you are voting for a slate of delegates that are instructed to vote a certain way based on the results of those elections to become a delegate differs heavily state to state some are appointed by the party based on the outcome of the election others are elected at local caucuses
and also he ca n’t talk and forgets where he is because lebron has dementia and is 1000 years old
john fetterman had an even worse debate against dr oz since it was right after he had a stroke but still won his election biden will be fine this news cycle will be brutal but americans have extremely short memories and biden can assuage our concerns by doing rallies like today 's in nc at least once a week if not more
i 'm not disagreeing that he was a mess out there but there 's plenty of time left to make up for it papaw joe had a cold and when an 82 year old has a cold it 's a lot worse than when a 32 year old has one backing out of the debate because he was sick was n't an option because cnn would have just let trump talk uninterrupted next to an empty podium biden had to show up sick or not because he would 've looked like a punk if he did n't hopefully september he 'll be better and he needs to do rallies like the one in nc today like 2x a week between now and the next debate
they definitely would n't vote for trump they just would n't be motivated to take time out of their day to stand in line and vote for a party that they feel disrespected them
true but not as much as replacing him
her husband does n’t help her case either
he read complete sentence today
i wish you luck i hope you will survive 4 more years with trump
well what if there is n't a primary or caucus as people here are proposing they just get to pick at their whims sounds bad
this did nt occur in a vacuum and is nt an isolated incident
why did he immediately go to waffle house with a cold it 's a clear lie by his campaign to cover for poor performance
there 's no coming back from that and it was n't a cold that 's a terrible excuse anyone who 's had an older family member with cognitive issues can recognize the distant look in his eyes
and it would be their fault just like it would be the pro palestinian protestors for sitting out because they felt disrespected why do you feel the need to patronize black people
sure the good ones do n’t count we know
the primaries and caucuses already happened biden 's delegates were elected biden 's delegates would choose the next nominee there would not be time to hold new caucuses or primaries it 's either that or biden is the nominee you 're right sounds bad there is no good option here none
probably because his people told him he needed to get out there and prove he was n't a corpse dude blew it and he knew it that 's why he did all the post debate activities and why he did the north carolina rally today
i 'm not patronizing just telling you what i 'm hearing from black folks i live in a majority black city and half of my family is black
i would n't extrapolate anecdotes to literally all black people that would be like saying all latin americans support biden when a startling amount support trump for whatever reason i would respect a group of people 's intelligence enough to understand that passing up on a potentially better candidate because they did n't get exactly what they might have wanted is the essence of bernie bro energy
do things like this really matter i live in an area of the u s where murder is a constant there have also been 700 migrants texas sent living a few blocks from me for about a year the murders and crimes here are all done by people who were born and raised in the u s not trying to diminish what happened at all all murder is awful i am just genuinely wondering if stories like this are effective and resonate with the american people i realize i am biased and desensitized on this issue
t does not speak ' with ' people he does not even speak ' to ' people he only speaks ' at ' people
maga troll and one trick pony posting variations of this story over and over again wait til you find out how many white men murder white girls in the us every year let alone how many right wing evangelicals and their penchant for diddling and raping young girls
if you want to hate immigrants it ’s an excuse to hate them that ’s really it show me an immigrant who ’s committed worse crimes than trump and i ’ll start worrying about them
all would n’t say all murders and crimes it resonates because they illegally entered the country and if they did n’t illegally enter the country the child would be alive the immigration system is overwhelmed right now and there are not enough resources to deal with it currently dealing with it the vetting needs to be increased but it ’s hard to vet people who come here with no documents i wish biden ’s proposal went through it would have helped a lot trump is playing politics disgustingly
personally i believe one of the most effective trump strategies is making americans believe that the rest of the world is dangerous and we should all be scared not only is it easy to sell and sort of takes a life all it 's own but it 's also easy to fix once you are in office especially if your goal is an authoritarian police state and your crime rate was actually historically low before you took office despite all your lies meanwhile he lies about the economy being truly terrible under biden so that when he raises the middle class taxes and creates more corporate greed and higher housing prices he can say he inherited a bad economy
stories like this are effective the democratic parties weakest issue is immigration and trump took advantage of it
i do n’t like trump but how is posting a factual article about a presidential candidate trolling all it says is he spoke with her mother and that ’s it you can have your own opinion on the matter but the headline is n’t even biased in any way
well if you read the article this illegal alien raped and murdered a 12 year old girl i ’d say that ’s worse
show me an immigrant who ’s committed worse crimes than trump and i ’ll start worrying about them stupidest comment in internet history
what i 'm pretty lenient about immigration and allowing them to try to find a better life here but trump has n't committed murder he was only convicted of paying off a hooker the wrong way
i would sooner believe the earth is flat then anything coming out of trump or any of his filth supporters mouths why believe anything from them they are proven liars
did some border fence hopper steal a ton of our national secrets and leave them in a public bathroom in a club that 's crawling with foreign spies where all you have to do to get in is give trump some money did they conspire to overturn an american election and incite an insurrection that led to the deaths of several capitol police dozens of cia sources were killed or otherwise lost shortly after trump stole all of those documents the damage to our national security in incalculable this is n't even in the same ballpark as some gang member or drug dealer or whatever you imagine immigrants are doing
he falsified business records in the furtherance of commiting campaign finance fraud which you could argue tipped him into the white house whereupon he shat all over the constitution took foreign emoluments non stop gave away our allies ' intelligence secrets to our enemies stole children from their parents with no plans to ever reunite them put 3 zealots on the supreme court which took away like 160 million americans ' rights for the first time in who knows how long and just legalized bribery and gutted the ability of federal agencies with subject matter expertise to regulate companies that will happily poison your air and water to save a buck which will lead to many thousands of preventable deaths he stole a ton of national secrets and left them in what is a public bathroom if you pay him a membership fee which probably got dozens of cia sources killed and did incalculable harm to our national security he intentionally did nothing to help deal with covid because it was initially just killing people in blue states that did n't vote for him he conspired to deprive you of your most fundamental right from which all of your other rights are derived to have your vote counted in a free and fair election and tried to have a mob violently coerce his vice president into stealing the election for him but yeah at least he did n't commit a murder
trump is solely respondible for everyone who died from covid
no he was convicted of falsifying business records to aid him in an election
because the mother ’s best friend confirmed it you do n’t have to like trump but this is a fact it ’s not like the person who posted that article made it up
i remember my first beer
you sound angry he 's not very successful at any of his crimes i d rather that person killed by an illegal immigrant be alive than for trump to not have carried out his crimes
that 's an insane take i hate the guy but he 's responsible for operation warp speed which got the vaccine out asap it 's like the one thing he 's criticized for on conservative conspiracy subs
falsifying wrongly business records paying you 're being pedantic if he paid off stormy daniels on the books it would not be illegal he did it the wrong way during an election so it was illegal
good reply sport you showed them what for rebutted everything written
this is like a trolley problem where there are like a million dead americans because he tried to wish away the pandemic and then sowed doubt in public health measures and a handful of people who 've been killed by illegal migrants and you 're like save the fewest number of people please
you mean the pfizer vaccine which was developed in germany by turkish immigrants
you can say what you like of course but the ruling and the prosecution was very clear
did i say we produced it operation warp speed was for speed approval and distribution
i do n’t understand this is a layup election with pretty much anyone else as the nominee even if it was biden from 4 years ago it would be a layup literally stick anyone not named hillary or kamala at the top of the ticket and trump is done and probably gone forever god the dnc is hopelessly inept
i hope someone somehow convinces him to watch a recording of the debate and then decide what to do
people seem to be looking short term if he can win this election but i have a hard time believing biden can last through a full second term finding a new candidate would be the most exciting thing to happen in democratic politics since 2008 and will without a doubt hype up the base instead of being ahh well i 'll vote for him if i remember it 's election day
remember when the craziest thing about a presidential or vp debate was a fly on someone ’s head i miss those days
this is worse than the titanic because he 's aiming for the icebergs and we 're all standing around saying well he 's the captain
cooler heads in the democratic party need to do whatever is necessary to get biden to step aside very few people see him as a viable president for another four years this is like giving the presidency to trump very depressing to watch the democrats driving directly toward the cliff when there is plenty of time to change course
just like diane feinstein and rbg these geriatrics will drag our democracy into the grave with them to satisfy their insane egos
the msm seems to be super invested in the idea that it is all over and wanting people to panic it has not changed my mind i am still voting for biden
he ’ll wait for the polls if they are as bad as i think they might be i suspect biden will get some suddenly bad news about his health in a week or so and discontinue his campaign
it ’s not the time to “ stick up ” for biden if you love him let him go with some dignity talk him into stepping down there ’s still hope trump is hugely flawed and bigly a felon many people are saying he should have no chance people want someone else anybody
ok fine then get ready for 4 more years of trump
he either needs to step aside or he needs to go on the campaign trail and make the case that his debate performance was the exception not the rule
the ego of these dinosaurs is beyond belief they all think they 're gods gift to earth and only they can win we need age limits across all public offices now
truly the giant douche and turd sandwich scenario one point we must all not forget to evaluate and that 's all the other staff chosen by the president for his cabinet ask yourself who is going to potentially have more staff that will act as guardrails rather than sycophants
it 's ok america had a good run but nothing lasts forever let 's just try to remember the good times
if joe are to step down after the debate it would raise questions about his capacity to serve as the current president the 25th amendment would likely become the primary topic of discussion for the following four months
ruth biden ginsburg ruining his legacy
go ahead and run then joe you are going to lose
lmao why now did n’t you all say that the videos of biden being a cognitive mess fake biden has been like this for the past 4 years if he ca n’t stand trial because of his mental ability he has no place running this country
over the past few election cycles there is n't a big difference between the dnc rnc from the president in office biden picked the head of the dnc and all the major posts while in the 80 's and 90 's there was still powerful enough party machines to make the party stronger than candidates today the dnc is just another apparatus of the biden campaign they are n't coming to anyone 's rescue
can you imagine how much of a landslide win this would be if buttigieg were up there
someone should really show him a side by side comparison between his debate last night and his vp debate against paul ryan in 2012
the fact that his campaign and several dem leaders are coming out and saying ya it could 've been a better performance but the message was there and joe is still our guy just shows they are clearly not living in the same reality we are they 're either gaslighting us to spin the narrative or they 're actually so out of touch and incompetent that they think last night is something they can recover from what they are n't doing is taking proactive steps to pivot to a candidate with a real shot of winning this election
here 's him earlier today complete 180 from last night could he have just had an off night
that last bit is spot on even if people claim they wo n’t ever vote for trump are they actually motivated enough to actually vote blue at this point
there is another risk you might not be taking into account whoever would get offered up would have to be someone universally loved by democrats or they would risk fracturing the vote i truly doubt an a list talent would immolate themselves in what would be the craziest election cycle ever but even if you pick one say gretchen whitmer can she actually keep a coalition of progressives and moderates together what her opinion on gaza does she support abortion on demand what does she think about gun control switching horses now lets various parts of the party ask why the chosen candidate does n't represent their views it invites them to rally around their own preferred pick maybe there is some kind of draft aoc movement that alienates jewish voters or whatever poison you pick plus all the conversation educating the electorate about the candidate takes time away from attacking trump maybe there are only bad options here but unless someone universally loved and admired comes forward i ca n't see how this would n't end with trump with 51 % of the vote and a bunch of other candidates getting some fraction off the remaining 49 %
lol that was mike pence right
that also describes trump ’s entire administration
the time to have done something was a year ago and before biden put the paperwork in for nevada the democratic party has lots of people who were placed in positions of power by biden not the other way around nobody at this point can push biden out without what would be a crazy political food fight that would guarantee a bigger mess biden 's campaign not the dnc controls most of the money that 's been raised biden 's campaign controls the organization the field offices the gotv infrastructure etc the only way a new person can step in is if biden bows out and all indications are that 's not happening to put a finer point on it there is n't a replacement candidate that the party could coalesce behind that would take on this dumpster fire of a race let 's imagine you for a second you have the unbridled ego of a politician that wants to president you 've spent years bowing and scraping and waiting your turn you 're going to blow your shot at being president on a four month race where you 'll be under the craziest microscope ever meanwhile if support of democrats splinters behind alternative candidates or rfk jr you 'll get blamed for not keeping the coalition together if i were a political operative working for gavin newsom or whoever was thinking about this i would put them in a medically induced coma for six months
which i do n’t get i mean does anyone look at biden and think he ’s enjoying any of this he got to be president against all odds because of crazy circumstances he beat trump once he won the lottery what does he want to die on the air force one tarmac
they do n't have to deal with the disastrous policies that trump and his sc justices will implement for the next coming decades joe will retire to his delaware mansion surrounded by family for the rest of his few remaining days while the average citizen struggles to pay for food and loses their civil rights
i 'd like to push back against some of this kind of cynicism first let 's remember that people voted for biden in 2020 and knew how old he was and they own some of the accountability people in california voted in feinstein her last election too and it was clear she was not doing well to reduce the issues to old people are bad and are just clinging to power i would ask that you also consider how impossible it is in our culture to break into household name recognition for your average politician we are voting in older and older politicians because we know them and their brand here 's another example why do they still make movies with keanu reeves he 's 59 years old and starring in action movies brad pitt is 60 a still a viable movie star there was a time in hollywood that someone that old would get a cameo as a wise old man alex guiness was 62 when he played obi wan kenobi in star wars today he would have been han solo i might have thought that technology and obsessive media consumption would make movie stars and politicians more disposable instead we crave something consistent and predictable in a world that is seemingly moving faster and faster now it takes decades to build up enough credits to be known widely enough to run for statewide or national office there used to be senators like strom thurmond and william byrd that were institutions in their state and stayed in office into their 90 's it was rare back then but it 's probably going to become more common the only way this will change is if voters across the political spectrum become less tribalistic instead of voting for a party if we all really evaluated the best candidates then we might not get politicians regurgitating whatever comes from the echo chamber trump literally focus groups his messaging on televised rallies until he knows how to say something exactly the way the crowd wants to hear it said but if you 're a young promising politician with a bunch of fresh ideas you 're useless to a system that demands that the tribe wins the race at any cost
if that is true he will have to step down from the presidency as well you ca n’t say “ i ’m ill and ca n’t run again but i ’m good until january ”
i was confounded by trump 's inability to score points off biden 's failures last night it would have been the perfect time for him to have been more dignified less crazed more focused and more factual but he seemed to descend below the moment rather than meet it as to biden he almost looked set up for defeat on both the visual and aural plane why did n't he look like biden and why did n't he address the audience more slowly emphatically and clearly he did n't even have to bother with trump
seriously how hard is this to understand
i think the weirder thing i 've learned over the past eight years is how little it matters who is president in terms of certain things sure some important policy differences happen but the rich keep getting richer somehow it 's almost like they benefit from two completely inept political parties that ca n't effectively put any pressure on them
regardless whether he steps down the 25th amendment will be at the forefront after that unmitigated disaster last night
and there is the rub joe knows that he needs to remain in power until hunter 's tax evasion conviction is adjudicated so he can pardon him the case is scheduled for september so let 's figure that he needs to remain president until october 1st or longer maybe they could negotiate with kamala name her as president and as a quid pro quo have her issue the pardon on the way out of the oval office
why do you think biden would be stronger than other candidates such as whitmer or newsom
this out of touch is the reason why trump was winning many polls even before this it ’s so bad that people are accepting of trump ’s risks
who do you think would have a better shot at winning newsome is about the only one with name recognition to even come close to biden and he 's not nearly popular enough to suddenly be launched into the national spotlight as the presidential candidate any one but biden would get fucking destroyed because no matter the public perception of biden he 's a known factor there is name recognition and a meaningful record to run on incumbency bias is so massive it 's honestly harder to lose an election as the sitting president than it is to win it as the new guy
“ his campaign and several dem leaders are coming out and saying joe is still our guy just shows they are clearly not living in the same reality we are what they are n't doing is taking proactive steps to pivot to a candidate with a real shot of winning this election ” there are no other candidates biden won his primary unless he can be convinced to refuse the nomination and someone else vie to be nominated at the convention then this is the way things are those proactive steps might have worked last year but it may be too late to do it without chaos ensuing it ’ll take more than this to rock the system at this point although you never know
a debate is when you need to be on top of your game you do whatever you need to do to not have an off night it 's basically a job interview jfc if trump wins we ca n't point all the fingers at the right dnc will have to face their own culpability in it
we saw how close the margins were last election imagine this one with even lower turnout
anybody who says biden is better than trump is n't helping at alll that 's like bragging about a c grade being better than an f grade no fucking shit but you need to be aiming way higher
critique your own party without bringing up trump challenge impossible
then make gavin newsome the vp running mate
power is like a drug these ancient politicians have had it the vast majority of their lives it ’s not an easy thing to give up willingly
to be fair i do n’t think it ’s impossible that trump finds a way to prosecute him
then that 's the message you have to drive home personally would i like a younger sharper individual on the dem ticket definitely will i be voting for biden if he 's still on the ticket come november definitely we know what 's at stake and that 's what we need to focus on also if biden suddenly stepped down after being elected something trump touted during the 2020 debate i would n't be mad about it
there are a lot of common ailments that would allow him to complete his term diabetes certain heart issues osteoporosis severe arthritis etc as long as they would n’t cloud his judgment or he can just be straight up and say that america has decided through the polls that they need a fresh face and he ’s always been willing to do what this country needs at any particular moment in time
this will open a pandora 's box those in his inner circle must have been aware of his declining cognitive abilities some likely took advantage of this and influenced his policies who knows how long this has been going on
and frankly his performance was bad enough that it should warrant conversations over whether he 's fit to lead the country today the fact that leadership is saying last night did n't waver their confidence for joe 's next four years is something i literally ca n't wrap my mind around
what utter nonsense biden is not going to pardon hunter
yup you basically have to dope him up with whatever stimulants he needs and then just keep him above ground until after november after that he will likely be too ill to serve and then it ’s kamala
yep only twice in the last 100 years has the incumbent president ’s party won the election without nominating the sitting president those being in 1928 when herbert hoover won and succeeded fellow republican calvin coolidge the second was in 1988 when george h w bush won election and succeeded fellow republican ronald reagan
chaos is half dead joe biden having another catastrophe debate in september and the rebuplicans winning every single fed seat up for grabs while trump makes reagan 's second election look like a close race i legitimately think if they ride joe biden to november the next presidential race will be between republicans and whatever party replaces the democrats biden ' 24 is political malpractice
i think democratic voters that participated in the 2020 election should also do some soul searching we engaged in a deal with the devil for a safe moderate candidate to defeat trump and passed on a bench of younger candidates that might have had a shot my god pete buttigieg would have utterly dismantled trump in that debate but who knows if mayor pete could win a presidential if he could n't win the primary
if turnout is down trump wins
they are still helping to preserve democracy and objective truth as an american value a vegetable on an iron lung still deals in the truth more often than trump
ok all we need now is joe to host snl guaranteed potus win
and it 's not just him on the power trip washington is a machine the leader whoever it is is barely more than a puppet biden has a lot of people behind him that want to see him elected because it benefits them personally
you ’re grasping at some way out there straws if it ’s a “ health issue ” he seems severe enough to where he has to drop out of the presidential race this late then everyone will see it as serious enough to where he also should not be running the country it can not be one and not the other either he stays in the race or he steps down completely
i ’d love to know exactly what they were preparing biden for trump performed exactly as expected and biden had no counter for any of it immigration abortion inflation tax jan 6 there were zero curve balls every lie trump told was the same as he ’s been sprouting at every rally biden could n’t make his own scripted points and could n’t counter anything trump was saying with any conviction trump even managed to drag biden down to discussing nonsense about his golfing handicap how could he not have slammed trump on that alone maybe if you did n’t spend your presidency at your golf course you might have left the country in a better state jack instead he ’s left mumbling about his was it 6 or 8 handicap and suggesting he ’d out drive trump incredible
i feel discouraged because trump just ca n't win he would appoint two more supreme court justices because thomas and alito will definitely retire if a republican is in office trump will pull us out of nato and trample on democracy he will put a national abortion ban in place
it 's gunna be another close election 2020 had 3 states decided by less than 1 percent despite losing trump actually still somehow found more voters in 2020 than he did 2016 i hate it but it would n't be surprising if trump got even more popular now despite of his felonies every time trump gets more worse he gets more popular it 's the complete inverse of logic
he needs to step aside because 1 his age has been a major topic of conversation for months nothing has happened to stop that criticism 2 he had one job to assure people he was up to 4 more years he failed 3 the negative focus will now be on biden ’s “ fitness ” instead of trump ’s that is the opposite of what is needs to be 4 they ca n’t tell us “ democracy is at stake ” and then tell us he can do the job i certainly do n’t want to risk it 5 this was n’t a “ bad night ” or a cold if it was then a cold can knock out an 81 year old at a critical time and he should n’t be president 6 trump once said “ only i can do this ” that seems to be what biden is now saying at this point i do n’t feel there is a candidate who is fit to be in the white house biden did a great thing when he took the white house from trump he has done great things in his career the most patriotic thing he can now do is pass the torch
anyone who has an older family member with cognitive issues can recognize the distant look he had in his eyes he needs to step aside or trump will win
how can people not have realized this before the debate he was questionable when he got elected i thought he was just a puppet that would step down and let kamala take over after 6 months already back then
hmm what i 'm reading in other articles is that it really was n't pundits say disaster undecideds how appeared to think otherwise
mumbles in dementia and poops pants reddit users be like i think that went well
donald fucked joe last night like he did stormy only difference is joe is lying and paying to cover this one up
you can tell by biden ’s first rambling answer that he was just spitting out accomplishments provided to him by his debate team like he wanted to get it all out before he forgot it i do n’t think he listened at all to what trump was saying for at least the first 30 minutes only desperately trying to remember the talking points
it seemed like biden got the most enthusiastic angriest when arguing about the golf scores classic old man shit
they probably prepared him fine he ’s just in a serious state of mental decline this would n’t be surprising at all if people actually paid attention with their ears and eyes instead of eagerly allowing themselves to be lied to and gaslit for the last three years into thinking this guy was perfectly fine
there is an insane double standard between democrats and republicans right now biden has to go because he had one bad showing trump gets to stay despite 34 criminal convications
trump ca n't pull us out of nato
after that debate that 's no way he can lose
not going to be close anymore trump just won
yup you do n't get better with advanced aging this is diane feinstein all over again why are politicians so selfish
but the guy with 34 criminal convictions gets to stay good work on that insane double standard
i used to do meals on wheels i saw this expression a lot it was really sad seeing someone you drop a meal off for every thursday no longer know who you are biden had that look last night
that vacant look in his eyes with the mouth open was scary i ’ve seen in before in parkinson ’s patients
and sadly the open mouth
the double standard this comment perpetuates is insane trump is cool staying despite his 34 felony convictions but oh no biden had a bad night
really fucking suspicious when all these accounts from european countries feel the need to comment on this and are all anti biden every four years
the dems are idiots and think they could put a golf ball up there and they 'll beat trump that 's why
literally just explaining what r conservative does to trump every day
no one is saying it went well
are these reddit users saying it went well in the room with us
he did poorly time for him to step down
no it 's when he told trump his son was t a ducker or loser
when you purposely ignore the nuance involved between two entirely different parties with different standards and beliefs yes absolutely it 's an insane double standard for others it 's more like biden has to go because people do n't believe he will be mentally or physically competent for another 4 1 2 years and trump gets to stay because the law does n't say that someone with 34 criminal convictions ca n't run for president
it ’s all about the power
the whole point of this discussion is how to get rid of the guy with 34 criminal convictions we all agree that trump has to go we disagree on how to make that happen
why do you want to be held to the republican standard
you ca n't change what the republicans are doing and what the democrats are doing looks more and more like a losing strategy to voter apathy
his whole party is insane
yup exactly what i was thinking
i 've seen people with 34 felony convictions not trusted with state secrets
amazing the people downplaying an 81 year old man having the performance you 'd expect an 81 year old man to have as oh no biden had a bad night it 's so disingenuous and disrespectful of another person 's opinion not caring about the electorate 's opinion is exactly why dems ended up in this mess in the first place
no one is saying trump is cool staying despite his felonies trump is the fucking worst but we all know he 's not going anywhere and that was n't a bad night that was a huge red flag to people that have dealt with these issues biden could barely form a coherent sentence and has no chance of beating trump now people want him to drop out so we have a chance of winning
oof the fallacy cope is real
lol have you been reading this sub
fine let me hear you say it joe biden is unfit to be president and i apologize for voting for him say it
my god you adjective noun accounts created a week ago are everywhere pushing this comment
you probally did n't watch his speech he gave today
no one wonder you like trump you seem to enjoy making shit up
yes have you lots of people are calling for another democrat to replace biden for the sake of democracy those who disagree still acknowledge that the debate made biden look awful
he ’s a hell of a lot more fit than trump who is incompetent on the verge of dementia and a huge asshole
i did he was better but anyone thinking he does n't have something going on is in denial or has n't dealt with this stuff with family members
neither of them are fit for office i 'm surprised that neither side of the aisle can agree on this do n't be maga for biden he 's unfit and we should be talking about it
i do n't disagree but i have a grandad a few years younger with left side vascular dementia who i just spent two weeks with in his nursing home and i do n't see the same in him he is old he should retire but that 's a perfect world scenario that we are n't in
democrats will never accept him his stance on vaccines is a redline
the one option that will never be on the table
on a similar note i 'll shortly be addressing the possibility of me taking michael keaton 's role in beetlejuice
dude lives in a different reality lol
oh great another rfk jr post no op it ai n't happening you can repeat the same yeah but responses but it ai n't happening and no he would not have a chance his spasmodic dysphonia makes listening to him difficult at best and insufferable at worst his views are a hot mess he ca n't hold a candle to his father and uncle the name means nothing and he 's nothing without it he could n't even bother to run for any other elective office before right wingers started funding his campaign his debate stunt last night alone shows that he just worth consideration it was amateur hour
the implication that this is a real possibility in this headline seems at least close to disinformation to me it 's at least just made up
the worm has a better chance
he has 0 % chances and still this is the best chance that he 'll ever have
zero fucking chance that happens ever
i ’d rather vote for major biden
this is not a serious alternative dude is hard to take seriously between literal brain worms and anti science views
how about go fuck yourself jr
is rfk jr a comedian because he is making me laugh
ya going to dump the old tierd guy for the worm ate my brain guy not gon na happen
i heard that kennedy had a debate with a crop circle last night i wonder who won
i d rather anyone run except for biden but rfk can get fucked
hell to the f'n no biden 's corpse on pcp and hopped up on episodes of bridgeton would be better
good job new york times
i 'd like to see him and parasitic brain worm fucking try it
this is absurd and not remotely a possibility shame on newsweek for pretending this is legitimate
biden has a bad debate and some knucklehead thinks a worm brained anti vaxxer should replace him
i laughed so loud i scared the cat
absolutely not he is the worst candidate in this race by far as an ex republican i turned my back on the party over its embrace of the anti vaccine movement and embrace of covid conspiracies rfk is like a caricature of the worst republican anti vaxxer posing as a centrist
that brain worm is even more dead than biden no thanks imagine having a convicted felon at the head of a major party ticket extra no thanks
there is about minus 10 % to 0 % chance that rfk jr completely bypasses the entire democrat waiting line of people that worked for the party and deserve to get the spot and clinches it himself if he were polling 20 % maybe out of desperation they would but now lol
lol in other news i discuss the possibility of taking richard wright ’s spot in pink floyd after all i also play piano and synthesizer
this is the dumbest thing i ’ve read all month
i 'll tell you what one of the most sane things i 've heard out of rfk is him responding to the question of him replacing biden by stating that he does nt think the dnc would pick him tbh from this guy i 'd have expected a more delusional answer
ca n’t say i know too much about him i ca n’t imagine biden winning this thing so i hope democrats come up with something i know he did n’t believe in vaccines but that ’s about all i know of him
trump is going to win anyway he will save the republic from the democrats ’ swamp
his stance on masks science save the environment the border and just the list goes on no
i really do n't like his stance on helping trump get reelected
i ’m aware though trumps climate change and global warming beliefs are much worse only issue mainly is that destroying the cia when we ’re fighting russia is a terrible idea
when was the last time you got a covid booster be honest lets face it the vaccine mandate was a step too far it should have been encouraged not forced biden literally campaigned on a promise of no mandates in 2020 and reneged on it kamala in the debate said she would n't get vaccinated if trump was in charge now nobody is bothering joe biden lifted all the covid restrictions just so he could give his state of the union two and a half years ago nobody cares anymore rfk jr believes in affordable healthcare reproductive rights ending wars environmentalism civil liberties closing tax loopholes and taxing the rich why should democrats scoff at him is everyone blue supposed to be ride or die with biden even if he leads the party off a cliff you look at rfk jr 's platform and think trump is better
agree 100 % he wo n’t be big pharma ’s puppet because he does n’t need their money
careful or bobert will follow you around trying to give randos handies
not necessarily a rfk supporter or really a supporter of the other 2 candidates though i believe after what i saw last night i have a small amount of faith when it comes to rfk though i do n’t believe i ’m gon na be voting for him though like you said i would put him into consideration
not exactly he does believe that the debate gave him a possible chance at winning
probably not though after watching the horrific debate i ’d rather have anyone else as president than those two
no issue with that at all
how can he be the worst when a possibly democracy ending and blatant fascist is one of the 3 options the bannon plant is better than the og ironically but is completely unserious and was meant to try to lure away biden voters which is n't going as well as they hoped with rfk jr rfk jr then became his own candidate and has changed his ideology multiple times in the same campaign i 'd rather an opportunist than a fascist though
i did think that the vaccine ideologies were very scary beliefs since it sounded very republicans even though he ’s supposed to be a “ independent ” or now i ’m hearing he ’s supposed to be a democrat
he 's a 0 % chance period long term less of a chance than anyone else
if you like brain slugs drink slurp
he is anti vax but he was also apart of the mlk je scandal in which he tapped the room of mlk jr with voice recorders because they said that he was “ a communist ” though i assume he improved over the past years since then
not sure it really depends on a crap tons of factors even if he does win there ’s a crap load of obstacles for trump to get passed since we ’re practically in a cold war
he soaks up trump voters pretty well though
woah what is this true
there are hundreds of issues
he is a kook and not a democrat
it 's almost like the global threat of the covid 19 pandemic has gradually subsided over the last 4 years i know you all feel kind of stupid about all that talk about everyone dying in mass from the vaccine or that this was a democrat deep state plot to force us to social distant or wear a face mask permanently
i have n't gotten a booster in over a year because i do n't need one thanks to the vaccine and vaccine mandates i do n't think trump is better they are both the absolute worst rfk jr is n't even a democrat
billionaires do n't need money but they still spend their lives chasing it there 's no such thing as enough for the kind of person who strives to become rich
rfkjr has less chance of becoming the democratic candidate than vladimir putin his entire family is on record saying he 's not fit to be president and no one should vote for him
he ’s either lying or delusional
well if you vote for rfk then you will end up with trump and the wonderful dictatorship that comes along with it while he sells our nation out to anyone who will build a trump resort
that was an unintended side effect
uh you forget the s perhaps
i believe that though i ’m putting faith in the guy who is the son of jfk he has experience with fighting against russia which is quite literally what we need right now
it switches from money to control once you get that rich everyone saying elon musk lost money buying twitter at 43bn when the stock says it ’s worth 30bn that is on track to own all the charging stations for vehicles if we go fully electric internet through starlink and now the most efficient news source on the planet and he took investors money to buy it if he wants to be a super villain he can
i believe he has some interesting views i do like how traditional he is though i do n’t like his mlk scandal
a little delusional though i like the spirit he has
woah vote i ’m surely not voting for any of these old grandpas lol
wtf are you talking about the only son of jfk who lived to adulthood was jfk jr this rfk is the son of bobby kennedy
dude i hate rfk too but he is not a ball of plasma he is a human being
we had a crazy bastard in the white house in 2016 2020 we do n’t need another one zero chance zero
he has 0 political experience 0 foreign policy experience 0 experience period unless information is completely gained though dna which it is n't
rfk jr is a loon
“ interesting ” is certainly one word for what his views are
i mean alex jones has some interesting views too
you voting for the loon rfk will end up being a vote for trump just remember what you helped bring about if he gets back in power any vote taken from the democratic nominee who actually has any chance against trump helps him
if only he were half the person his father was half i might 've seriously considered it nope
sorry i just got it all mixed up again
or another convicted felon who ca n't keep it in his pants
seems all candidates now are
i honestly believe voting for rfk is more of a vote for biden if anyone is seriously thinking about voting for rfk they were never going to vote for biden to being with
i just said i ’m not voting for anyone that includes rfk
yeah this is n't the year to play third party candidate games anyways i do n't think people who vote third party have the political sophistication to realize all the hazards of doing that chiefly the makeup of the supreme court is crucial and this particular iteration is doing real damage to american civilian life it 's no joke
have you gotten checked for brain worms
originally their comment said sun not son of jfk which is also not true he is bobby kennedy 's son
let me just say this you vote however you want do nt let anyone bully you from either party to vote their way vote your way also you do nt have to tell anyone who you are voting for i do nt know if rfk jr is the right guy but i 'm going to hear him out for a minute and see what he 's got i think it makes sense to look outside of both parties for a better candidate i respect your willingness to at least be curious i wish we had three or four serious contenders it 's going to be hard to vote at all if all our options suck we just have to vote for the person we hope will do the least harm ugh
i like plasma it does some fun things keeping us warm is one of them
but if jfk is the father of the sun who is rfk juniors father perhaps the moon or maybe it 's the man who has the exact same name as him
in this case venus maybe
if anything joe biden ’s poor debate forces people to decide early on if any of that truly matters the alternative is a convicted felon who thinks america is garbage people should decide what matters
and not one article on the gibberish and threats made by trump when he goes to jail what are the gop going to do
i doubt that newsom would do better than biden since i do n't think his california liberal image would work in the midwest i like whitmer but i doubt she has the name recognition to be competitive that being said i 'd love to see either of these seasoned orators tear trump apart in a debate whitmer in particular would drive him nuts and he might just drop a crude misogynist line that ends up sinking him or so i hope anyway
who should replace trump a convicted felon an adjudicated rapist found guilty of fraud and owes 500 million in fines impeached twice lies with abandon joe is n't the problem
biden is n't dropping out shit i 'd vote for his rotting corpse before i 'd vote for the felon
jon stewart he ’s the one who has it all decency a level communication skills not a part of the political establishment is half biden ’s age sharp as a tack universally known and trusted either nominate someone like jon or american democracy ends time to sack up
the media is going crazy over this but reality is joe biden is not gon na drop out
if biden does not intend to drop out his campaign needs to pump him full of steroids and drugs get media at his rallies to show how energetic he is and alive who gives a shit if the right says he is using performance enhancing drugs biden is 99 he needs it this is n’t an olympics sport his campaign needs him out there more to wash this away this debate stink i doubt trump is going to do the september debate because there is very little for him to gain unless something comes up between now and then if trump still does the debate biden needs to be jacked up all the way because that will be the super bowl for him
joe biden he 's a sluggish old candidate but he 's an effective president maybe just continue with the presidenting that 's what this race is anyways
replacing biden does not make sense from sheer electoral politics he 's a household name he 's the sitting president replacing him means killing tons of momentum and brand recognition from the undecided voters are there better options sure but they should have ran 4 years ago if that was an issue you do n't change horses mid stream it 'd kill whoever tried to run in his place apathy would be off the charts the number of people who 'd just vote trump because they know he was president one time would be insane sure the base of democratic voters would be there maybe but they 're not spread out enough or large enough to win the actual election
yo momma can biden 's fine if being a rapist traitorous felon does n't disqualify you from running for president being tired and sick as shit for a day should n't either biden was probably overwhelmed by the toxic gasses coming from his right
if we had put up elizabeth warren 5 years ago we would n’t be in this horrible situation and trump would be back to being just another billionaire wanker nobody
a few points 1 the worst thing the democrats could do at this point is replace biden he 's a face people know while he 's not caused to the us to soar to new heights he 's also not completely screwed things up either people prefer to go with a candidate they know 2 while biden looked awful at that debate it 's hard to say trump won trump stood there and lied his ass off for 90 minutes that 's not a victory 3 a week is a long time in politics while it certainly can happen debates usually do n't make or break a candidate debating actually proves little to nothing
sherrod brown is 71 i have n't heard much of him in a while i always thought he had the makings but i guess he never wanted it
now that the dust has settled it seems clear the democratic party leadership intends to stick with biden i think we are missing an opportunity to run a better and younger candidate but i 'm also more hopeful now than i was last night that he might be able to bounce back from this
i 've sort of been monitoring the coverage and the hand wringing on reddit for the past few hours if you 're convinced that joe biden is going to be replaced from what i 'm seeing the party is already lining up behind him there will be some descension but give it a week news cycle move so incredibly fast right now the scary thing is that this might not matter in a few weeks exhibit a your honor is that trump was convicted of 34 felonies and that already feels like old news i 've also seen lots of people from countries with parliamentary systems of government who are really confused by why the democrats do n't just pull biden they are obviously unfamiliar with the american system of ridiculous campaign spending and advertising that goes into presidential race because america is big and the electorate tends to be disengaged in the process presidential candidates are brand names and to run for president you have to spend at least an entire year building your brand so that 100 % of america has an opinion of you whether it 's positive or negative the only candidates that everyone can name are presidential candidates even gavin newsom does n't have the brand recognition to run for president but he could probably get there in four months most american high school graduates ca n't find canada on a map and you mean to tell me that jp pritzker is a viable last minute replacement it 's nuts at this point it would have to be kamala harris the rock or the girl who said you got to hawk tuah on that thing and trust me kamala harris would poll well below those other two alternatives
i honestly think that the calls for biden to go are only increasing in size and number and now that even people who previously backed him are now turning on him and suggesting that someone else go up and replace him is interesting to say the least and that is n’t even covering what is going on behind closed doors
they are n't replacing him the third way blue dog centrist clinton wing of the dnc will only give up power when they die see feinstein as an example they 've been torpedoing younger candidates that are more progressive than they are since 1992 this is why everyone in leadership in the dnc are octogenarians pelosi represents san francisco and is only two years younger than the golden gate bridge
literally anyone that is n’t super progressive
you could n't replace him with a politician at this stage you would need name recognition and an already famous person mark cuban robert downey jr etc would do better than someone most people have never heard of
rather than replace biden they should replace kamala with jon stewart that way the dems still get the name recognition of biden and everyone who hates kamala and does n't want her to be president would be more inclined to get out and vote
wow all those choices really suck ass no wonder biden 's dead cold body is the only thing the dems have propped for 2024 michelle needs to run and would easily win not even kidding
oh god the absolute chaos if this were to actually happen there would not likely be a consensus on whom at least some people who voted for biden in the primaries would likely get mad that suddenly their votes do n't seem to count anymore the gop and russian disinformation ops would have a fucking field day etc
i think everyone 's freaking out a bit too much undecideds were pretty split on who won the debate it 's republicans who would think joe lost no matter what and democrats who wish he had been much better who think he lost that 's not to say he won the debate he certainly did not but i do n't think it 's quite as bad as people think biden showed some energy in nc today i think he needs an audience and his lack of audience hurt him a lot
people forget the first obama v romney debate obama got run over like a kid on a bike on the freeway however he won re election biden is not obama on his best day but i really do n't think we can count him out
run him from jail hope he wins and then bust him out
he 's not going to jail he 's literally going to get away with it all
i mean this is kind of whataboutism trump would literally never drop out and everyone knows that so there ’s no point calling for that also trump ’s falsehoods blathering and general nonsense are nothing new biden ’s clear loss of mental acuity is new hence all the articles written over the last 24 hours i say all this as someone who will absolutely vote for biden and abhors trump but biden ’s not fit to be president at this point i ’ll be voting for biden ’s cabinet and positions and to keep trump out not for biden
yes because as bad as trump did biden was straight up incoherent it was that bad the fact the media is n’t focusing on how shit trump was should tell you something
we do n't need name recognition we need younger and carries swing state newsom would get the kitchen sink thrown at him with his extramarital affairs and coastal elitism the solution is so easy run shapiro and whitmer boom victory
something like being found liable for rape or the famous grab them by the you know what that kind of comment
yes same but we ’re not who biden needs to win and that ’s the issue
ditto the man could put on a wig floppy feet and call himself freckles the clown and i would still vote for him without hesitation
this right here believe it or not people like newsom and whitmer are n’t universally known my parents who follow politics a little did n’t know who either was and we live in ohio just across the line from michigan kamala is n’t popular sherrod brown is n’t well known enough either nor is pritzker only other people i can think of that are democrats with the needed name recognition are hillary and michelle obama also did see one person last night mention al gore i do n’t think any of those 3 would have a chance
not a bad choice better than any of the 6 on this list
i ’m just guessing that there might be some vetting issues with a guy that ’s been a comic since the mid 80s there ’s a lot of indiscretions that no one really worries about when a person is in the entertainment industry that suddenly become problematic when a person runs for office
if he ’s so effective why the abysmal approval rating
i 'd be okay with gavin newsom or gretchen whitmer
he 's a sluggish old candidate who wo n't survive another 4 years
if dems continue to run biden then republicans will take the white house in november
ask people in dearborn mi what their household thinks of biden
his brand is 50 years of creating the mess we have today if your horse breaks its leg you get on a different horse
i would choose gavin newsome or gretchen whitmer they are both better than biden and trump anybody who just spouts biden is better trump is not helpful at all that 's like bragging about getting a c grade being better than an f grade you should be aiming way higher than that for the president of united states
the debate is n't the problem not really anyway it 's the optics the right has been shouting about how old and frail biden is for pretty much biden 's entire term and last night proved them right all of the denials do n't mean much when the proof is staring us right in the face slackjawed and mumbling with his transparent skin sloughing off biden could come back from this but any and every attempt is going to be significantly hampered by him constantly proving his challenger correct by simply existing
538 called it a basic wash in changing opinions
debates are mostly meat for the media
that debate was catastrophic for biden he 's done whitmer is the only shot
trump definitely won that debate his line was the most memorable i do n't know what he said but i do n't think he knows either i laughed really hard at that because sadly it was facts trumps fans do not care that he is lying and i 'm a liberal democrat living in a swing state trust me when i say we are cooked unless we change candidates moderate swing state voters are not gon na vote for a old man whose mind is rotting away even if the alternative is a convicted felon liar they will just stay home when turnout is low democrats always lose
enjoy donald trump as president then this is n't as complicated as your making it you 're basically supporting trump by sticking with biden at this point
we just pretending that obama never happened
the people voted for centrists over progressives and they do it consistently bernie sanders lost fair and square
short of serious medical issues like dementia
i ’m not sure if you ’ve got a direct stat on the undecideds neither do i but the mainstream media ’s portrayal of how biden did is gon na be what shapes their opinion most likely and the media ’s portrayal is not flattering to say the least
this is n't about who won the debate it 's about what the debate revealed about the two men trump was revealed to be exactly the dangerous lunatic we all knew he was biden was revealed to be incapable of taking on the danger of trump i do n't like that not one bit i 've been behind biden all the way in this contest and i 'd vote for a ham sandwich over trump but we need to keep our eye on the goal the one thing that matters here is defeating trump if biden ca n't do that we need to change to someone who can and fast
neither of them are remotely electable gabbard is basically a republican and rfk is a straight up nut job
did obama look like he had dementia i ’m not joking or even trying to be mean biden looks and sounds like he has dementia
and trump got stomped by clinton yet still won debates do n't really decide anything
this is not remotely comparable let ’s be real
that ’s a big difference also obama has such charisma that it ’s easy to claw back biden even when younger never has obama level charisma
yeah man because one thing that will help with dementia is time
except the thousands during covid because of his anti science policy
i ’m tired of this “ victimless crime ” nonsense it ’s utter bullshit the victim is the millions of voters that were prevented access to the information prior to voting because of the conspiracy to cover it up something that potentially resulted in 4 years of shit policies that directly affected millions of americans policies that got hundred of thousands of people killed because of poor responses in natural disasters and a pandemic we can go even further and look at all the damage his supreme court picks have had on basic human rights hell even if you do n’t think those are victims then surely hillary clinton is a victim from the actions she was denied a fair and honest election
now do the other 3 cases
you realize the right wing spews lies about everything they had to edit footage to develop the narrative you are pushing up until the other day i suppose if you push bs 24x7x365 eventually you might come close to one being partially true but still a single exception moment trump is n't fit to be alley cat the only reason biden is running is because trump is a massive threat to the country
who does he need to win that 's not someone like me i 've been a registered independent for decades
vetting issues are irrelevant compared to trump unless stewart is some sort of serial killer it wo n’t matter one bit
then we deserve the orange dicktator if the american people prefers the loud lier and rapist
i 'd venture to guess that a large number of people who take the time to talk to pollsters do so because they have an opinion they want to express people who are perfectly content with the job biden is doing do n't take those calls
the california thing would take more than three months to work out gavin wo n’t work in swing states
he only needs to get through november there 's a vice president for a reason
i 'd love to see a president kamala if biden has to step down at some point in the next 4 years
you can scoff but gwb really was n't any more popular in 2004 than he was in 2000 and he was able to beat kerry pretty handily being the incumbent is a big advantage
yeah momentum because he 's the name everyone knows he does n't need to establish himself with the population he 's already been the face of the party for 4 years he 's the one who is on all the ads and getting tv time suddenly saying newsom is the candidate just makes people go who the fuck is newsom so now the party has to spend most of its time and money even getting people to know the name at some point it 's simply not possible with this timeframe people will check out and not care
if they change they lose in november like i 'm not sure if you realize how badly a change would impact the democratic chances in november they could nominate abe lincoln and jesus christ as the ticket and they 'd poll 10 points behind just because they 're the new guys
objectively a c is better than an f if going for a b makes it more likely that you receive an f you should take the c based on your risk tolerance given the f is a pretty big deal in this case the risk is n't worth it take the c biden
most people decided on jan 6 2021 which way they 'd vote the following election there 's a reason nothing is moving the needle two old white guys one being a felon are the choices for president same as in 2020 do n't know about you all but i 'm not voting for a convict that tried to overthrow the government
gretchen whitmer yeah go sit down somewhere
let me put it this way i think if biden is cooked at this point than anyone else that would be willing to replace him on the ticket would be too michelle obama or anyone else you could possibly name could n't win this deep into the election cycle the entire race would become about the replacement and not about trump the entire election strategy of the biden campaign it to focus on how dangerous trump is here is the hard truth sticking with biden at this point may not be a winning strategy but changing horses in the middle of the race probably ai n't either if you do n't want trump to win i suggest voting against him in november
obama never controlled the party it was run by the centrists in the house and senate in 2016 clinton supporters blamed sanders supporters for her loss by claiming that they should have voted for her all the while ignoring the fact that significantly more clinton supporters did n't vote for obama in 2008 the centrist democrats control the dnc how do you think that clinton got the new york senate seat she is n't from there they pushed a lot of candidates out of the way made deals with others to have them drop out like how clinton got secretary of state under obama everything with that group is nothing but backroom deals for power take a look at how superdelegates work for the dnc they exist solely to keep the voters from electing a candidate that the party does n't want and by party i mean the clinton wing people saw that clinton was the status quo candidate in 2008 and 2016 both times were when the status quo was in desperate need of change
the centrists that are in control of the party heavily put their thumb on the scale there were states where sanders won the majority but got fewer delegates thanks to the superdelegates that were appointed by the party debbie wasserman schultz had to resign from her position as the head of the dnc for violating their policies in order to favor clinton in the primaries and was immediately hired by the clinton campaign
exactly cnn reported democratics are panicking
who cares liberals are fake af
better than biden crime family
i had a family member who died of an aggressive form of dementia and it looked more like donald trump just saying
he looked completely unprepared during that debate everybody here in reddit thought the dems lost the election let alone the debate biden had some good moments but not nearly enough i agree he had a cold his stuttering is getting worse he was thinking waaaay to ahead of himself he locked up but i still say that he 's not out of the race a race where people would vote for a shit covered rock over the other guy
it 's a stutter dementia is confusing people with completely different people and thinking airports existed during the civil war
have you ever actually interacted with someone that has dementia
you do n’t know what dementia actually looks like then biden had senior moments sure but dementia is a whole different ball of wax
but clinton ran a shitty campaign i voted for her but she was so sure that she was going to win she went to the wrong states gave the wrong speeches got hammered by the far left that was n't a good campaign as much as i wish had won
nobody has ever lost a debate like that people could have easily concluded or confirmed their suspicions that biden had n't just lost a step but that he is only one step away from thoughts and prayers
the real part is who are you going to vote for reddit said it last election we 'd vote for a corpse with a good cabinet over trump i do n't think biden is a corpse or has dementia he 's a decider a competent president has never been a good speaker and this was his fuckin dump day of course it looked bad i agree but i still do n't think it changes his chances at being elected
not that election it was closer than you think the claw back was boots in the ground a good local and national campaign everybody thought he was going to lose and romney was getting ready to give his victory speech and then he had to rewrite it on election night biden has that organization running right now we 'll see how it plays out
yeah over a million americans died if he had actually taken action i bet hundreds of thousands of lives could have been saved
it is objectively being proven the democrats would not have done better because exactly the same mistakes are being repeated as the outbreak grows with at least 114 herds infected in 12 states as of june 18 researchers said the cdc and fda are not moving fast enough to remove barriers that block clinical labs from testing in one case the diagnostics company neelyx labs was on hold with a query for more than a month a covid test vetted by the who was available by mid january 2020 rather than use it the united states stuck to its own multistage process which took several months namely the cdc develops its own test then sends it to local public health labs eventually the fda authorizes tests from clinical diagnostic labs that serve hospital systems which must then scale up their operations that took time and people died amid outbreaks at nursing homes and prisons waiting on test results in contrast south korea immediately rolled out testing through private sector laboratories allowing it to keep schools and businesses open “ they said gear up guys we ’re going to need a ton of tests ’ ” said frieden now president of the public health organization resolve to save lives “ you need to get commercials in the game ” greninger said the delays and confusion are reminiscent of the early months of covid when federal agencies prioritized caution over speed test accuracy is important he said but excessive vetting can cause harm in a fast moving outbreak like this one “ the cdc should be trying to open this up to labs with national reach and a good reputation ” he said “ i fall on the side of allowing labs to get ready that ’s a no brainer ” clinical laboratories have also begun to develop their own tests from scratch but researchers said they ’re moving cautiously because of a recent fda rule that gives the agency more oversight of lab developed tests lengthening the pathway to approval “ think about our judgment of china ’s transparency at the start of covid ” nuzzo said “ the current situation undermines america ’s standing in the world ”
she lost because she neglected too many states
i do n’t get why trump even cared if people were ok voting for him with “ grab her by the pussy ” fuck a porn star 10 years earlier is n’t going to move the needle
spare me hillary is not a victim she absolutely had a fair chance and lost maybe she should have not skipped wisconsin or been more careful with those emails oh well
except they wo n’t be decided before november
swing state voters who might not show up to vote that 's who we need to win
the voters who flipped from trump to biden in 2020 that ’s who and the voters who would never vote for trump but maybe are not motivated enough to go out and vote for joe that ’s who
does n't have to be the outcome different candidate changes everything
gavin would win this election handedly and pretending otherwise is just hilarious at this point if the husk of joe biden we saw last night is dead even with trump right now then a 56 year old white male who actually can talk would run away with this election a well read student could have wiped the floor with trump last night a qualified politician that is well spoken would have destroyed him
yeah just continue to lie to the american people for the vote replace him with a walking breathing human or run kamala
i think you share that opinion with an electorate that is not large enough to win an election
you might but even fewer people support kamala than biden
you have a point about gavin but that does n't have diddly to do with biden obama clinton bloomberg kennedy those names ring any bells
i disagree with that trump is insanely unlikeable and all they need is a common face or name
then you absolutely suck at studying i do n't wanna study more because i might fail i 'm just gunna do nothing instead
nice job getting the year wrong
sure i do n't disagree the larger point is biden is done
hilary pretty much had all the same baggage to some extent as trump did and trump was still a bit of an unknown quantity a lot of people thought that were enough guard rails in place to keep trump from doing anything far out and expected that a godless hedonist coastal elite like trump would be the sort of republican that was about tax cuts and business and less about returning america to puritanical values
i mean i agree with all of that but this debate was significantly more disastrous than obama vs romney round 1 that ’s just the truth
we can pick a better corpse than this one captain
you can not objectively prove a hypothetical situation
sure but you can see how her opposition conspiring with news outlets and covering it up was also bad for her
yeah i 'm not buying that anyone who would n't show up to vote because of a debate would have been voting anyway sounds like a reddit argument
does n’t change anything unless it is a known senator or politician out of the midwest or south and even than it is a power struggle for who it is and we end up with some bozo because its “ their turn ” if you replace biden you need the most down the middle politician possible where the swing voter looks over and says i actually prefer them over trump even if it is a democrat also if i see one more newsom comment i ’m gon na lose it no one in southern or middle america wants the governor of california running the country they would rather trump be in charge that would be worse than rerunning hilary
he would n't the vast majority of states like pa mi wi virginia are n't going to be super happy with newsom at least not yet he 's gon na take some time if we ran newsom we 'd lose by pretty epic margins pretending otherwise is hilarious at this point
not enough time ironically i ’d vote for gavin but the states that matter would be a huge wildcard as we approach the 4th
well read students have votes so do the other people
you 're not even making sense i 'd vote for biden 's rotted corpse before i 'd give a vote to a convicted felon that does nothing but lie
i 'm not arguing that point but comparing grades to candidates is a clunky analogy to begin with i just tried to work with it when you 're talking about the impact of studying on academic performance effort and time spent have a direct effect on the outcome weighing the likelihood and outcome of electing biden trump or an alternative dem candidate is n't the same thing this is a question of risk does pivoting away from a known commodity with an incumbent advantage increase the probability of electing trump maybe not but probably so most people who will be voting did n't watch the debate and the outcome wo n't influence their position both candidates and their platforms are well known at this point are we well served by a mediocre candidate who surrounds himself with competent people and governs effectively that depends on what the alternative is in this case it 's a lying shitbag who governs ineffectively for me the risk of increasing the probability that we elect the shitbag is outside of my risk tolerance you may think that it 's worth the risk which is okay i am going to vote for whoever the dem candidate is incumbent or otherwise
shhh they think they 're being smart just sit back and enjoy the stupidity
uv lights bleach no mask policy hydroxychloroquine ignoring it and blaming fauci are not hypotheticals
her conspiring with the dnc and other news outlets was also very bad for bernie they got what they paid for
this is correct and i am from california we need to replace biden with a red purple state governor whitmer or shapiro would deliver the most electoral votes ie their home state even better if we use both of them it does not matter what a leftcoast voter wants every election comes down to swing states and they want midwest rust belt candidates this is what 's wrong with dnc it 's like they ca n't even do simple electoral math
maybe in a normal election not this one
biden is going to get blown out though so what ’s the difference
the convicted felon does n’t really hit because it ’s a payoff which everyone already assumed washington politicians do every single day and multiple presidents have admitted to doing a whole lot worse
you did n’t answer the question
this is a normal election all elections are normal people make choices and those choices have led us here now we get to make more choices the choice to remove biden is n't a good one by any metric especially with as good of a record he does have we change horses mid fight and we 're gon na lose even if we do n't go with someone like newsom whitmer would have a better shot but her numbers would be lower than hillary 's at best hillary 's and hillary was a pretty known brand
who said that mess do you have magic that sees the future
not gon na bother the convicted felon is still a convicted felon regardless of what you think about it and i 'm not voting for a convict
purity tests are how we got trump the first time if moldy bread and shit are my options i am eating the moldy bread even if i 'd prefer filet mignon
oh no i fully believe trump ’s campaign met with russian agents the summer before the election and was in contact with them the meeting in trump tower absolutely happened and they did n’t go meet there to go talk about the yankees and the weather i also fully believe the news outlets both sides of the spectrum have a huge amount of blame for trumps rise they covered him because he meant ratings they did n’t realize the harm they were doing and did n’t think it was gon na matter until he ended up winning the amount of coverage trump got the other candidates could n’t afford to pay for he got it for free just by being him it should n’t have mattered hillary still should have won to this day i do n’t think trump actually thought he was gon na win and i think he went into election day believing he had lost hillary and her campaign failed to accurately gauge how angry the middle class was they assumed too much they took too much for granted and they lost
that ’s not hurting trump much though it did nothing to his base and do n’t think it did much for the undecided
that was a lot of words to not answer the question again
wow has the nytimes ever done something like this tbd on what kind of traction it gets but this feels like a huge departure from the norm for them
the replacement candidate is obvious jimmy carter
this is a big fucking deal nyt editorial board calling for the president they would 've endorsed to leave the race insane
i ’m legitimately shocked the times wrote this not that i disagree it ’s one thing for a bunch of individual columnists to say biden should leave the race but for the editorial board to say it is on another level i still think biden is too vain to do it but this just ups the pressure on him to do so
the country 's biggest newspaper has said that biden must resign holy fucking shit what world am i living in right now
maybe he does i ’m honestly not sure but i know for sure that the convicted felon rapist and insurrectionist really needs to leave the race he does n’t know what it means to serve his country though
i love him and it hurts because he has been so great but this is bigger than just biden
the issue is simple i think we can all agree that biden just looks so old that it ’s scary i do n’t think it ’s hyperbole to say that he could die in office if reelected people on reddit say they would vote for a corpse over trump but can you say that true for swing voters the answer is no they wo n’t for biden if he comes off as not having the cognitive strength to lead trump who is 3 years younger looks like he is at least 10 years younger any time biden does n’t have a teleprompter is a problem joe is a good man but if americans do n’t think he is competent then trump will win
honestly i feel that replacing biden also plays into trumps hands in a way it 's basically acknowledges the whole joe biden is senile mantra that the gop has been pushing for a 4 years straight and gives them all the momentum
people saying biden should step down and let someone else run but never say who realistically has a shot of winning who in 4 months will get the name recognition and favorabiility and campaign apparatus together along with no baggage needed to do this it 's never happened before and this election really is n't one to try and risk everything on a gamble
trump should drop out no convicted felon should be allowed on a national stage to tell dozens of lies like that it used to un american and it should be now
pretty damming that the nyt editorial board would write this about an incumbent dem potus
look at what happened to rbg we do n’t need a repeat
i do n’t think people will remember him kindly if he does n’t leave the race
ca n’t wait to be gaslit in here by people who act like we do n’t have eyes and ears like it ’s been all day long been super weird in here today and definitely some bots downvoting anybody being honest about it biden is a good man and i have nothing for respect for him and donated to him last time around i wish he even ran in 2016 but he needs to do the right thing and drop out it ’s not hyperbolic it ’s reality we can have feelings and feel sorry for him but the truth is if a change is n’t made he ’s going to lose and hurt the entire ballot especially in swing states
reminds me of rbg at the end of obama years people loved her and thought she could live forever when in reality she was old with a history of health problems biden should step aside or we risk the same situation
like other commenters are saying this is definitely a continuing theme with older democratic leadership holding onto the reins of power and the citizens end up paying for it i wonder if he 'll do what rbg or feinstein could n't but this is a pretty big voice asking him to do it
where were these articles months ago when we could have had a serious primary anyone who was n't already worried about biden as a candidate before the debate has n't been paying attention for the past 4 years fucking corrupt morons running the dnc would rather hand the country over to fascism than allow any real leftist populism to flourish
i had already canceled my nyt paid subscription earlier this year over nyt ’s normalization of trump seeing that the editorial board responded to cnn giving a bully pulpit to a pathological liar and convicted felon by declaring that biden should end his campaign i unsubscribed from the newsletter too when i got this opinion in email i have also stopped listening to the daily which used to be my favorite podcast because i do n’t want to support nyt anymore i realized i am still subscribed to games so i guess i ’ll have to drop that also it ’s deeply sad as i became a subscriber to the nyt because i thought nyt ’s reporting years ago was absolutely critical to fighting against magaism and investigating trump and generally protecting democracy this is the message the editorial board chooses to send not how deep in danger we are that trump has been allowed to get this back closer to be back in power after everything he ’s done i ’m just depressed it ’s a brutal fall to watch i loved the nyt used to be my primary news source and the voice i trusted the most i ’ve lost all faith even though i know nyt still has some great reporters i just ca n’t be part of this anymore i tried to send this as feedback to nyt but they literally wo n’t let you send feedback unless you ’re a subscriber
if biden 's replacement loses in a landslide this november the times and everyone else pushing for this will look utterly ridiculous i 've saved this story offline for posterity
does n’t matter what everyone thinks it ai n’t going to happen this is the choice we have for 2024 true that debate was bad i ca n’t stand to rewatch it but a vote for biden is also for the cabinet he puts in place think big picture who do you want to be in those positions in the next four years fuck the media they ’re all about making money with clicks
any replacement at this stage would have a tough time getting on the ballot in all the states
what a moment in american history
the time to worry about biden 's age was 2020 hell i did not want him originally because he was too old then but the democratic electorate decided that he was their choice and frankly he 's been an objectively good president enough so that one bad debate performance when he was obviously having feeling under the weather does n't change that the alternative is a treasonous piece of shit who already tried to destroy the union i 'm voting for geezer over the felonious traitor
what are the polls saying
i miss the days when the gray lady 's editorial board did n't sound like a weekly fishwrapper whose editor tried to get rid of a hangover with a bump of crystal
biden just can not win after covid trumps approval dropped and bidens was about 10 % ahead and despite that trump mobilized his voters and almost won a second term on election day it was a very close race now it is the other way around trump is 10 % ahead of biden and do n't you dare to think that biden can mobilize voters to catch up on the 10 % like trump did in 2020 on contrary biden did everything possible to piss off a substantial amount of voters since october 7th that is why his approval dropped in the first place when i talk to people to still vote for biden to avoid 4 years of trump they tell me they will not vote or vote third party candidate because they do n't want to reward biden for his support of a genocide people will not forget that israel seems to hold its horses a bit right now and their bots are seemingly more active maybe they want biden to think the conflict is over that the people will forget and that he can win maybe the israelis want trump to win and the best chance for trump to win is if biden runs for president the israelis will probably unleash havoc with a new series of atrocities just days before the election this will remind everybody of what biden did and biden will loose a good leader knows when it 's time to avoid a battle and to retreat in honor if biden continues he will most likely be humiliated with the worst defeat in the history of the us presidential elections and not just that it will be a defeat against trump a notoric liar a convicted felon and an instigator of january 6th and with his defeat biden will drag the world down with him this will be his legacy or he steps down now and his legacy will be to have saved the world from another 4 years of trump
the problem with that is that as pointed out by lawrence o'donnell the biden campaign 's war chest can only be transferred within the current ticket meaning that none of it could be used to benefit a potential new candidate unless that candidate was kamala harris who let 's be honest has a worse chance than biden does given her race gender and the fact that her presence in the current administration would n't allow her to even escape any of the biden policies have been bad rhetoric any new candidate with an actual shot at winning like bernie sanders gavin newsome or pete buttigieg would be fundraising from square one when it comes to actual campaign cash that is a massive hurdle
this is happening we are living through history
can someone point me in the direction of the nyt editorial calling on trump to drop out after being convicted of 34 felonies oh you mean there is n't one
does n’t seem feasible to field another candidate and build a strong national profile in the time remaining and biden ’s not pulling out anyway he might be smart to select another running mate like newsom vs harris who would instantly be in over her head if she had to succeed biden
and to save america the orange ding bat should go get a job at a boat yard and work on some electric boats himself maybe in the water by a socket if he does n’t drop out neither should grandpa mcgee
if biden dropped out trump would declare victory and claim no need for an election his minions would agree and there would be hell
y'all do realize that biden dropping out would send the message that trump is much stronger right
fuck the nyt this is n’t a question of biden vs trump this is a question of democracy vs fascism
lol 0 upvotes cause its a mainstream reddit sub
ok i get most users in r politics are liberal me included but there is a real conversation that a lot of people in this sub are n’t ready to have that biden dropping out might be a very necessary thing to prevent trump winning would it be embarrassing sure but legitimately the entire democratic institution of this country might be at stake otherwise
pretty big if even the nyt editorial is coming out with this regardless dems will have to make a choice soon
i wholeheartedly agree biden has been a good even great president his administration has accomplished a lot but the stakes are as high as can be and him looking and sounding frail and incoherent in the most watched election forum we 'll have drastically hurts the way the public perceives him and his odds of winning he should step aside precisely because the stakes are so high because if he is unlikely to win we need to pivot to someone who has more of a chance at beating trump
this kind of feels like the first domino to fall i suspect lots of people in democratic political circles want biden to step aside but nobody wants to be the first to come out and say it now that the nyt editorial board has endorsed him dropping out it gives other organizations and politicians cover to agree publicly
i agree whole heartedly with this i tuned in hoping to see biden like he presented himself at the state of the union within the first 30 seconds i knew we were n’t getting that and i do n’t think we can recover without something drastic i hate to say it but we need to be bold and do the right thing here biden needs to step aside
people who are downvoting this are willfully putting their heads in the sand disagree or not the nyt coming out and saying this huge political news
romney “ trounced ” obama in one debate that did n’t faze obama why should joe quit if he believes with all his heart and soul that he can do the job his speech in north carolina after the debate was moving “ when you get knock down you get back up ”
the important thing is that we do whatever our i d tells us to do after we watch tv
vote blue no matter who mfers still coping need to let it go he ’s too old
trump was the reason biden won in 2020 now biden will be the reason trump wins in 2024 both horrible candidates for different reasons
ca n't wait until the news cycle flips this shit is already insufferable
rapist and felon enthusiast says what
i call on everyone to please reject this media insta narrative it ’s a huge distraction and will only make dems ’ chances lower if followed biden has a large and growing motivated anti trump coalition trump has a shrinking maga look at the delta between electoral results and polls over the past two years that ’s everything you need to know reject these calls to kick an own goal biden is a terrible debater maybe not even a great candidate but nobody is voting for biden they ’re voting against trump and against abortion restrictions and the data shows they will show up
i got a gift article for ya right here nyt
joe 's back to his usual self one day later
so much anti democracy propaganda lmao
nyt is right on this one we should n’t hold our nominees to the standards republicans set they should be people we are proud to vote for
i agree with the editorial board that he should leave the race it seems clear to me that the public wants a different candidate to face trump there would be nothing more democratic than to give the public what they want it does n't need to be more complicated than that i also think that his replacement would win easily against trump if biden chooses to resign his candidacy as is his choice we need to be prepared for what we want to happen next it 's very appropriate to have this conversation we 're citizens in a democracy members of a political party we 're allowed to talk to others about what we want we can say out loud that we want biden to drop out and what we want to happen next there are a few ideas that i think are already closed that should n't be seriously discussed third biden should make this decision himself we should n't consider using the 25th ammendment to remove him from office against his will it 'd be counterproductive and a misuse of that part of the constitution second highlighting biden 's faults criticizing him and his record is not part of any plan to defeat trump instead we should demonstrate our confidence that we can select a replacement and support them all the way to a victory chaos at the convention is not an inevitability finally if biden does not drop out we should still vote for him no staying at home no third party no write in go out and vote for him
getting old sucks getting told you ca n't do a thing anymore sucks not being able to actually do the thing sucks failing capacity is terrible but it is real as anyone who has had a loved one go through it will tell you i dread when it will happen to me joe biden deserves our love thanks and compassion he does not deserve our votes he absolutely should step aside
wtf maybe baby jesus will come back in time to replace biden and we can all be saved give it a break already dead or dying biden ’s still our best chance
what has happened to nyt biden had a bad night it just means he ’s human nothing more
to service his country donald trash trump should be the first man on mars
biden is here to stay and i love it
the drive of the democratic establishment to wear blinders is steadfast biden is going to sink down ballot candidates with him
well to serve his country the convicted felon should leave the race so there
trump is going to win in a landslide he ’ll take minnesota and virginia at this point
he should but he wo n’t and the dems will lose they are the better of the two parties and it is n’t particularly close but few of these people actually care about you or me
to serve the country the ny times should close up shop and shut down it be a great service to truth and transparency in news reporting
extremely irresponsible of the editorial board
the double standard the mainstream media has for democrats and republicans is insane biden has done so much good for the country in the last four years but one crappy debate and that 's it trump has similar gaffes multiple times per week biden is fine
clearly no one has thought through the logic of “ i ’m too old to run a campaign but i ’m not too old to continue being president ” he ca n’t do one without the other
i do n't care about the debate performance the nyt writing this while not tackling any sort of this conversation with trump is asinine fuck this editorial board
well now the republicans are talking about the 25 th amendment to oust him from office this is exhausting the kind of person that could tear into trump probably wo n’t be very likable bernie sanders could but most people still hate socialism elizabeth warren could and kamala could biden was chosen because he is likable
we are not allowed to post petitions here so i wo n't but i will say there is one and i signed it
when the ny times publishes something like this you know the wheels have completely fallen off thanks for failing the american people joe biden and the democratic party
to serve its country the nyt should shut it 's doors or at least go back to what it was 50 years ago
strange they did n't do this after one candidate was found guilty of 34 felonies
desperate times call for desperate measures joe biden will not win this election people have to stop fooling themselves and rally around change any pundit worth their salt is saying it nyt msnbc pod save america when these guys are saying it ’s time for a change it ’s time we ca n’t afford another 2016 it ’s so obvious that ’s where we ’re headed
simple they remember what diane feinstein did to the party she should have stepped down and so should biden right now we do n't need a selfish ahole wanting to put two terms on his mantle personally i think he had a mini stroke a few months back he is not the same 2020 biden or 2023 biden there is no cure for aging and senility biden will not get better with age you better like his vp since she will most likely be president in a couple of years
fucking reckless at this stage i ’m not saying it should be off the table but we certainly do n’t need them taking charge less than 24hrs later
they ’ve been pushing a heavy anti biden narrative ever since the president would n’t an interview considering the times has published like three different stories with varying titles on the same topic since yesterday is also pretty telling they ’re corporate vultures looking for their cut of flesh nothing more
sarcasm right they do this daily
what a shock that a far right rag like the times would try to sabotage the democrats
if you have followed most of the journalists from the nyt they have been saying this for a while astead herndon one of my favorite nyt journalists and host of summed up the debate best imho but i got to say as someone who has dedicated the last year and a half to asking a lot of democrats questions about how we arrived at an 81 year old president running for re election they have consistently dismissed the overwhelming evidence that most americans thought biden was too old to run for a second term i brought that question to them at the dnc as they were making his path to the nomination easier and the answer that frankly we got at the time was that donald trump would be so inherently invalid none of that would matter but there was no evidence to support that that was their own belief that that would just change and then tonight not only did donald trump not seem like someone who was completely unfit for the office of president but that biden was the memed version of himself the incoherent falling off a bike tiktok caricature of himself and i think now the democrats are openly panicking about what biden should do next about what the party should do next they have a lot fewer options at their disposal because of how democratic leaders handled this situation for so long there is no plan b they refused to ask the questions that would even lead to the creation of a plan b in the lead up to this and so there are n’t really clear solutions as to what democrats should do going forward and that really i think is going to scare a lot of democrats because if you ’re someone who wants joe biden to be president a lot of those people believe that donald trump is a grave danger to this country and the belief was that joe biden was the person uniquely positioned to stop that from happening because he had done it four years ago but i think what ’s changed from last night to today is a realization that actually nominating joe biden might be the biggest risk for the party and be the very thing that makes a second term of donald trump most possible
ny times only cares about clicks this will get clicks
i think they ’ll still endorse him but they ’re right
eli5 why the nyt editorial board is more important journalistically than a standard news outlet trying to understand impact here
it ’s shocking but to be fair last night was beyond shocking
i do n't know how you look at last night 's performance and say this is the guy we want sitting down with other world leaders the next 4 years that 's just being objective
this has been my reaction as well
and this sub is just downvoting it into oblivion because it does n’t want to hear it
american population would rather have a felon than biden lmao
the issue is that even if he dropped out today it 's not feasible to get a new person in who would actually have a real chance at wining incumbency is a huge advantage as is having a job history as president no one else could just show up and get any sort of traction to their campaign it 'd just be handing the win to trump at this point
which is why i disagree with calls for replacement it 's not just biden we 're voting for it 's a whole ass administration if his strength fails completely in his next term he has a good competent vp who can pick up where he left off i 'm voting for biden because his administration more or less shares my vision for for future
feels like i ’m in the twilight zone when i read comments like this we ’re talking about the president with the lowest approval ratings in modern history and we ’re talking about him dropping out because he does not appear cognitively capable of running a successful campaign what do you mean he has been great
if this was last year then sure but it 's too late now bringing in someone else now would hand it to trump there 's no surprise like obama waiting in the wings yet
who would even be an alternative at this point i would have loved to see pete debate last night dana and jake would have needed to call the fire department but really who at this point is an option and can win
we can like the man but be honest about this it ’s time for him to drop out
he did n't listen to the people and kept aiding isreal 's war
he who is he clearly biden is n’t running shit on his own scary times for the usa
true but a shame when trump is n't competent either he 's just louder and more charismatic with his incompetence
the problem is that not replacing him also does that because he looked downright senile last night attacks work when people can see that there 's some truth to it
not acknowledging it is worse because it ’s true it was confirmed last night they already have all the momentum we ca n’t combat a liar with more lies
absolutely not biden is just about the only candidate who loses to trump the issue now is that those better candidates have less time to create a profile should have done it sooner but better late than never
also like wtf that 's straight up playing kingmaker we 're past the point of being able to choose a candidate through primaries our two party primary system sucks but at least there 's some illusion of choice i voted for bernie with the expectation that he 'd lose but hope that he would n't but at least i had a chance to vote for him if joe gets replaced by anybody other than kamala who i do n't want and probably has a worse shot than joe how is that not absurdly anti democratic at a time when you 're trying to message that this election is about saving democracy
exactly all of this is predicated upon the assumption that somebody stepping in after biden bows out at this late date would fare better against trump than biden would this is not the same as whether biden had not run at all furthermore this also ignores the down ballot races it 's not yet clear what the net overall effect would be on congressional races it seems quite possible biden stepping out now would have a net negative effect on enthusiasm turnout etc of course with both candidates being geriatrics either could croak tomorrow so who knows
i 'd take whitmer newsom pritzker harris and even shapiro over biden at this point biden 's cooked he completely flamed out on the national stage last night hell the international stage he looked and sounded frail and he could n't even complete some of his thoughts he went viral for looking and sounding like a walking corpse every democratic and left leaning pundit afterward was shocked and concerned and started scrambling it was a disaster
you would need an absolute rockstar candidate with tons of name recognition i do n’t see it newsom is nt there
personally i like adam schiff he would wipe the floor with trump he also is better at foreign policy than newsom or harris
biden is all but guaranteed to lose at this point there are plenty of people who can run and beat trump do n't get me wrong i will vote for biden if he 's the nominee but i understand what 's at stake i 'm not even that upset with his presidency but more than anything we need to beat trump and biden is n't going to
trump will tie any dem to biden with just as much coh as him now it 's an even worse strategy period you ca n't run from biden when you were all for biden for 4 consecutive years any dem in power objectively was at least aipac fetterman is standing on what he believes to be principle on this front tbf to him win with him or lose with him there 's no way out 4 months from an election
no offense to you but this same argument with nearly the same words has been made for the last year at least
but never say who realistically has a shot of winning are you just gon na pretend that newsom has n't been absolutely dominating these discussions for months
jon stewart is the only option
any democrat chosen at random out of the phone book that does n’t have a long history of being a neoliberal warmonger “ successful businessman ” billionaire could beat trump
actually i 'm okay with convicted felons not being barred from running for president i 've gone back and forth over this but it 's a weird mechanism that allows for a nelson mandela or eugene debbs candidate to run for president from his her jail cell after being imprisoned for political reasons but i do agree with your general sentiment we 're supposed to have gatekeepers national media state ballot processes etc to screen out candidates who present a real and present danger to the republic they were happy to pile on bernie but completely shat the bed when it came to trump multiple times in a row apparently they 're more threatened by a socialist than an insurrectionist rapist convicted felon
i mean sure morally he probably should but as long as the republican base continues to give him high approval ratings and gets out and votes for him that is all that matters in an election campaign
the idea that the us is a moral country is beyond satire
yeah i do n't always agree with them their coverage of trans issues is atrocious but they 're still the paper of record in this country for good reason
this opinion piece perfectly sums up my concerns i think it ’s very well written and i think most people on those sub would agree with them
wild how many comments in this thread do n’t understand that
if he loses his legacy will be really and i mean really negative if he wins he will be remembered as the dude that kept the white house out of trump twice
if he refuses to drop out and loses to trump i 'll have the same admiration for him which i had for hillary clinton after 2016 none
cough cough rbg another one who did n’t know when to gracefully exit
absolutely this nyt piece is a very direct warning of how he will be remembered he wants to be well remembered
those same people were not going to remember him kindly anyways
this should be the case but unfortunately rbg still has cultural icon status when she made the same mistake
and replace with who it 's easy to say drop out but there is no viable alternative candidate
he can leave the race but trump would still be the favourite to win by a long shot which democrat could galvanize and maintain a larger support base wirhout splitting democrats than trump within 4 months
and who against trump that 's the issue here do we want to risk trump winning this time around as much as i 'm not a fan of guys in their 70 ’s running but we really do n't have a choice
save it things will be even worse if it does remember 1968 no one is humphrey in the current d party period
nah i think as long as they ’re actually officially nominated at the convention that would be taken care of remember at this point biden is still the “ presumptive ” nominee his name would n’t go on ballots until after the convention i believe even ohio finally fixed the issue they had with the timing of the convention vs when state law said the candidate had to be nominated
100 % agree and it underscores why the editorial board posting this opinion is extremely irresponsible if their true concern is what is best for this country it would be political suicide to start fresh with 4 months to go
may 30 2024 by the editorial board in a humble courtroom in lower manhattan on thursday a former president and current republican standard bearer was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records the jury ’s decision and the facts presented at the trial offer yet another reminder perhaps the starkest to date of the many reasons donald trump is unfit for office the verdict itself establishes that mr trump committed crimes in hiding pertinent information about himself from the american people for the purpose of influencing the 2016 presidential election it revealed even more evidence of what mr trump is willing to do including breaking the law and pushing others to break the law for political gain that chronic impulse to override democratic norms and the law to his own ends is at the heart of two other criminal cases against mr trump for the much more serious charges of spreading lies and participating in a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election he is also charged with mishandling highly classified national security documents after leaving office twice he showed classified documents to people who were not authorized to see them according to that indictment mr trump ’s lawyers have managed to delay those three trials seems close enough to what you 've asked for not sure what a specific call for him to exit the race would 've done since he 's not taking anything the times prints under advisement whereas biden actually might
if you read the article they address this exact point in short republicans do n’t give a single fuck what the new york times thinks of trump
the wall street journal editorial board called on trump to resign after jan 6 that 's the closest thing i can think of republicans wo n't care what the nyt tells trump to do
have you read the editorial
there is still time for you to delete this ridiculous comment
i ’m still holding out a vain optimistic hope that michelle obama will jump in i know it wo n’t happen but god damn would it be crazy if she did she would also absolutely sweep
the debate already did that
who could possibly watch the debate last night and think biden is stronger that message is already sent it 's done
um he is if biden does n’t he ’s gon na lose if he does and replaces with a younger candidate they can flip the age argument right back on trump this might even bring people over from the gop who are looking for alternatives to the orange felon
yes and fascism may win if biden stays in the race what ’s your point here
i actually think r politics voting is manipulated by bots towing the party line probably by pacs and other actors you will generally find that any article that is maybe bad for a democratic politician who has n't been thrown to the wolves yet e g menendez for corruption is downvoted any article that is like bad confirmation bias posting is upvoted i 'm not talking about the occasional conservative poster who comes here to get downvoted by the 95 % liberal make up of the sub i 'm talking pretty much any liberal or progressive opinion that goes against the official line of the party like i think most democrats even on r politics believe this right now and you will never find that a post like this is upvoted
people do n't want to admit that the economy is going to crash and we 'll have border patrol rounding up brown people in 6 months because despite every poll since q3 2021 indicating we need a back up plan for after we lose the election and right to vote we have collectively refused to consider it most germans voted against the nazi party they were a minority party do we have anything positive to say about 1930s germany despite most of them being opposed to fascism no because while they did n't vote for it they accepted it like the majority of democrats have done
the democratic party will tear itself apart trying to pick a new nominee the progressives will want to put up a candidate who will make george mcgovern ’s election loss look like a squeaker
why should joe quit if he believes with all his heart and soul that he can do the job because he ’s wrong if he told you he believed with all his heart and soul he could win the super bowl would you put a helmet on him and say “ go get em tiger ” stop enabling a delusional senile old man
did you even watch that debate obama 's poor performance was a world away from what we watched last night obama lost that debate but did not raise questions about his intelligence or competence in the process
this nyt piece was essentially written the way you might talk to your older dad or grandfather when the time comes to take grandpa 's car keys if he stubbornly protests the appropriate response is not to cheer him on and say everything 's fine it 's the same thing here i know biden truly thinks he 's rising to the occasion but it 's become clear he just ca n't and someone needs to tell him with kindness and dignity
romney ran his campaign like he was a plant from the democratic party romney was responsible for one of the greatest it failures in human history prior to election day mitt romney 's team was already bragging about project orca a web app that would connect tens of thousands of volunteer poll watchers in the field with the home office in boston it was all part of a massive coordination effort to get republicans out of the house and into the voting booth normally that 's done with simple paper and pencils but orca was designed to digitize and streamline process while centralizing the effort and allow the campaign leaders direct re direct resources on the fly to the areas they were need most on the day after the election complaints started pouring in from the volunteers indicating that not only did project orca not improve the process it may have actually hindrered john ekdahl a volunteer who writes at ace of spades hq outlined the various glitches and breakdowns of the system instead of handing out voter lists at local offices volunteer were emailed 60 page pdf and told to print them out at home the night before the election they were n't given official poll watcher certificates or told that those were required to enter most polling places the app was n't really an app at all it was secure website creating confusion for volunteers trying to find it in the itunes store it also did n't forward from standard http protocol to https leaving those who did n't the correct url lost on a broken webpage volunteers in other parts of the country shared similar complaints the emailed packets came late or not at all pins that were required to login and download the voter lists did n't work and could n't be reset calls and emails to the held desk went unanswered and the entire system may have just completely crashed in the middle of election day frustrated volunteers struggled to get answers that never came leaving most of them to fend for themselves or simply give up wasting an entire day without bringing a single new voter to the voting booth this cycle trump has succeeded in completely taking over the republican party apparatus totally trashing it and it may still do better than romney 's did i have thought for a long time that romney 's incompetence was what made trump 's rise inevitable the establishment republican party proved it was not serious about actually trying to win a presidential election
the news cycle might flip but biden wo n’t get any younger and he ca n’t undo what happened
having a president fail to run as a competent mentally capable candidate against a fascist is insufferable the remaining vestiges of enthusiasm for biden are burning out and his electoral viability as a result is going to be impacted this needs to be addressed
sure let ’s just all collectively ignore what we all saw last night we have eyes and ears and you ’re right trump could easily lose if he ’s swapped out for witmere or newsom etc they will beat trump easily
gaslighting is n't going to work this time
if americans ca n’t stand against having a cognitively impaired president who ca n’t form a full sentence then trump is the president we deserve
does it matter the presidency is a job where you ca n't just be half alive one day and then coherent the next you need someone who 's with it the entire time it 's why trump is so dangerous as well
i 'm sure trump does too
the public could have voiced their concern in the primary the protest vote failed to reach a meaningful level
a bad night is one thing but it ’s not going to get any better in the next four years
sleepwalking to another trump presidency
i think they are under reacting biden on the ticket 2nd trump term
it ’s not an overreaction nixon lost to jfk mainly because in the first ever televised debate strictly from the optics this like a million times worse he already has low approval ratings and needs to win over swing voters in swing states if you think he accomplished that or can do anything to change the perception at this point you ’re not in reality
the article spends a whole paragraph praising biden for how good his presidency has been the point they ’re making is the man he is right now is not who people voted for 4 years ago and more importantly he ’s not a man they think is going to beat trump in november
the editorial seems to really like biden but the threat of trump might be too big to risk it with biden and what appears his health deteriorating
if you think joe biden should be the nominee you ’re okay with trump winning that ’s your right but it ’s something that people have to start saying you ’re gambling this country collapsing into fascism because an 80 year old man ’s ego wo n’t budge in the face of an impending disaster
nah rolling out a decripified biden as the last ditch effort against fascism is irresponsible but you ca n't expect much more from the party that rolled out diane fuck them kids feinstein until she turned to dust if this election is as important as the democratic party says it is then why are n't they putting out their best and most energized candidate to win it
i agree the headline is irresponsible
i agree with you and found your comment hidden which makes me think you ’ve been radically downvoted the reddit horde generally follows the media hype and the media ’s created an insta narrative wait one week and nobody will care anymore wait two weeks and trump ’s getting sentenced on to the next hype cycle yes biden flopped and missed an opportunity no kicking an own goal in response will not win this race
read the article they are explaining well that exactly because trump is that big of a threat biden needs to step away
biden is losing the polls
sure his administration has done good things biden clearly listens to his advisors trump is scary because he does n’t
in a sane world a convicted felon like trump and the other indictments would be an automatic disqualification apparently only dems can do bad stuff or have an old president if you are a republican it 's perfectly fine
could he do it for another 4 years should this even be a question we are asking of a incumbent president for reasons such as these he 's shown obvious mental decline in this debate and it does n't make me think he 'll be the right person to fill the seat of power with the most quick decisions
that ’s what a vp is for but also admitting that you ca n’t commit to another 4 years in office is very different than serving out your remaining 7 months
sorry americans are failing themselves
did you watch that debate i voted for biden and will vote for him again but that was a fucking disaster
donald trump agrees he is often yammering about the failing new york times
they actually did donald trump is unfit for office
honestly some here are so dense please think for a second or read the opinion piece
do your part oppose the rapist
it 's funny that you think hail marying another candidate at the 11th hour without party consensus will work either especially when nobody can name that candidate this is the guy rally
meh doomers are going to look foolish in november
they do vote for biden you are voting for an administration and our democracy the country will survive joe biden
time for this escaped retirement community member to be put back in his room he needs to be replaced
let republicans nominate trump and then have biden step down with a clear endorsement of somebody other than kamala do that and democracy is saved in november
please read the opinion piece i think you have no arguments left after reading it they covered all bases
you 'll be back in two months saying it 's way too late to do it now
yes we do the change has to happen and that only occurs if the corporate media does n’t cover for the corporate friendly candidates
this is the entire board publishing an article the “ varying titles ” were each editor ’s personal article how can you know which way they ’re slanted but not know how an editorial board works
write editorials sure i ’m talking about recommending the incumbent democratic president to bow out of an already started race
it 's kinda like the difference between a congressman saying putin is a war criminal and the official position of the united states being that putin is a war criminal this is n't a journalist saying biden should back out it 's not a journalist at the nyt saying biden should back out it 's the nyt saying biden should back out
i agree it was the worst presidential debate performance i 've ever seen and it came from the nearly 82 year old current president who was already dealing with widespread concern about his age and mental fortitude
look at all the posts upvoted today they are all trying to down play the reality
if he dropped out of the race he would still be president there ’s a lot he could do as president to support the nominee
which is why i disagree with calls for replacement it 's not just biden we 're voting for it 's a whole ass administration i understand that it sounds like you understand that but joe smith swing voter in michigan he does n’t care he sees deceptive videos of biden staring blank faced and now he just saw it on a debate stage joe smith ai n’t voting with us if his strength fails completely in his next term he has a good competent vp who can pick up where he left off i 'm voting for biden because his administration more or less shares my vision for for future i will absolutely vote for biden and do everything i can to help if he is the nominee but when we are the point of saying “ do n’t worry when he dies he has a good vp ” then we have major major major issues
it 's not just biden we 're voting for it 's a whole ass administration oddly enough it 's entirely possible to have both a good and competent administration and a president whose default stance in a debate is n't open mouthed gaze into the void
that ’s not a winning message for a campaign to make even if it works for you people are n’t turning out for “ the biden administration ”
i hear you and feel the same but that wo n’t get enough people to show up
you ’re not the type of voter who is going to decide this election i like biden as a person too but we have to face reality here the stakes are too big to not make a change
he 's not getting a next term i do n't know how i can say it more plainly not with that message
i live with elderly people and have watched their slow decline 4 years is an eon for the elderly and biden ’s already showing serious fatigue it ’s not coherent to consider him viable for four more years in such a high stakes occupation unless critically necessary he and his administration would be better than trump but it ’s incredibly common for the elderly to reject the frailty and diminished capacity of age the dnc should step in if there ’s any chance of righting the ship
honestly i think half of it is bots lol it ’s been insane in here today
i would refer you to his policy platform and accomplishments most of which align with my views both domestically and internationally
i guess they want to point to the ira average american knows either nothing about it or they know it cost a trillion dollars and it 's purpose is to make their electric bill more expensive
i ’ve been saying that they ’ve failed for a while now they should ’ve been getting a successor out in front at least a year and a half ago if not two full years ago
actually a michelle barrack ticket is theoretically possible
any non fading non octogenarian non neoliberal warmonger democratic citizen chosen at random out of the phone book could beat trump
shapiro newsom whitmer they are the next generation and one or some of them will be president if we still have elections
cracks me up i 'm pushing over forty now and as a life long dem it 's always for certain that we soft af fickle through and through democracy at stake and people crying an old man acted like an old man i tell ya what i 'd vote for a 80 year old ham sandwich over trump just because not only would it smell better but it would still outsmart that idiot at anything anybody who is changing their vote to trump after last night no matter how bad it was is not a serious person at all and should be treated as such
there 's no good solution to that whole mess and you ca n't just ally with either side so quickly if orange man was in there he would have gone full steam with israel and would have been worse from gaza remember joe biden is not the president of the world or the president of the middle east i say this being deployed to iraq twice i love many of the people i met there but adding religion to the mix creates chaos which is the problem with both of them i was in basic training during 9 11 so the attack on israel i get how they responded to some extent the reason we deployed to iraq did not align and we were in the wrong but it happened because people jumped the gun remember the freedom fries thing because we were pissed with france and people supporting the global war on terrorism blindly there was a lot of damage that hurt innocent people in iraq but we were so blinded by patriotism that many of the consequences went unreported i learned that as a us citizen deployed heaven was back in the states and i 'm not religious either a war with anyone that involves religion is stronger than a war on a country race and or creed both sides think their god s are supporting them all i can do is control my circle love my wife and daughter i cherish every damn day keep in mind orange man would been 100 worse on your suggestion
to be fair he mistook gaza for medicare
you apparently did n't watch the debate then the options are advocate a foreign policy that tried to broker a negotiated peace deal and return of hostages while minimizing casualties in a war we do n't control or i 'd have gotten out of the way and let them finish the job take your pick they both suck but at least one of them is trying
that has literally nothing to do with this by and large people do n't care about the war they care about biden standing there with his mouth hanging open while staring into space he was exactly what republican attacks tried to make him look like by cutting up clips but in real time for two hours
americans sadly do n’t care they want the appearance of competency we all know trump is a liar and is incompetent yet the american people will have no choice because i think they worry about biden being able to do his job going forward
which candidates polls numbers are over trumps we have newsom harris and jb that have had polls run with their name in them i want a link to which one is out polling djt
i dunno who is enthusiastic about voting for biden i think all the enthusiasm is for voting against trump for many i doubt who the dem nominee is matters much another candidate however might actually create some enthusiasm
newsom is horrid i would pick adam schiff any day he tore up trump in the january 6th hearings
there are plenty of people who can run and beat trump polls say there 's no one period biden is the only one even keeping it close looking at all the data it 's a big assumption and a wrong one
yup it is not the time to be a selfish egomaniac like diane feinstein
name these people who do you actually think has a chance newsom he is too west coast for the average rust belt voter to support and has a lot of baggage in california from local issues that will be blown way out of proportion whitmer she 's almost a total unknown with no national profile at all she might get you michigan but that 's about it so who do you put in the ring at this point who is this magical candidate who checks all the boxes has a massive national following and can set up and run the election with only months to run
morally he 's a convicted felon but what biden is old he fucked up in a debate so he has to step aside but let the 78 year old lying rapist career criminal conman and convicted felon fraudster stay in the race is there a special standard for trump because he 's conned millions of people into believing he 's a strong man seriously he 's running simply to keep his fat ass out of prison for stealing government documents and instigating an insurrection
so president wannabe hitler is what we deserve
if you think the most liberal paper of record in the us handles trans issues badly you must have some absolutely ridiculous beliefs on trans issues
joe biden 's legacy will be tarnished forever if he lets trump back in the white house
remember how terrible feinstein looked being wheeled around can you imagine america ’s president being trotted out in a wheelchair drooling all over himself that ’s actually a possibility if he wins
putting biden up against trump is risking trump winning why do you think democrats are considering this at all
we should not be afraid to put someone else against him trump was n’t good yesterday either witmere newsom etc would crush him in november and it would n’t be close
thank you christ this sub is can be such an echo chamber not every bit of bad news about biden is a conspiracy any time an unfavorable poll article is posted it 's downvoted to hell but a poll in biden 's favor makes it to the top it 's warping our view of how things really are part of why last nights debates took us off our guard i remember this sub smugly suggesting trump would n't even show up to it before then any article suggesting biden 's mental acuity is slipping would have been downvoted to hell and labeled a media hit job
cool because i do n't give a single fuck about what the nyt says about biden either
they are the national paper of record it 's not their job to parse what certain segments of the population may think of what they write before they write it if their argument is that a candidate should drop out because he had a bad debate night then the argument that a candidate should drop out for being a 34 time convicted felon and adjudicated fraudster and rapist is also valid
literally their whole argument is that trump is so bad that biden should drop out like maybe the argument should be that trump is so bad that the gop should nominate someone else
there 's still time for you to stop huffing the irrelevant nyt editorial board 's farts
she also has never held office and does n’t want to
lol what you know that 's a maga conspiracy right
anyone with half a brain only a fucking idiot would listen to trump 's verbal diarrhea and think he 's stronger whatever the fuck that even means biden dropping out would be an enormous admission of weakness that would absolutely push moderates away
look at how weak the democrats are they lost one debate and ca n't even stay loyal to their candidate now they 're trying to shove a kid with no experience in christ the amount of doomposting going on here is making me wonder if there 's a dedicated psyop happening
my memory of that debate was obama acted like he was about to fall asleep because he was exhausted
yeah he better turn things around before he fucks up and undoes his opponent 's attempted coup 3 years ago god imagine if someone tried to overthrow the usa and was then allowed to run again someone might think the usa was a fucking joke
who cares i 'm not voting for a felon no matter what
lots of big words that do n't really matter reddit is n't the real world this is just a bunch of online noise at the moment the election is n't tomorrow and most of this country has the attention span of a gnat
no they wo n't the average american does not know who those people are there are no candidates available that have the same support that biden has changing him out over a bad debate would literally just hand it over to trump
did biden faint and get taken away by an ambulance did he have a mcturtle freeze did he ask for fries thinking he was at a wendy ’s drive thru you would think from comments like yours that blindly follow the media insta narrative that something awful went down what actual happened he ’s old and not great at debating which hey guess what we already knew
yes it matters apparently he had a cold he looked and sounded so much better the next day he 's still running the country and campaignimg add debate prep and a cold to that and it 's understandable that he had a bad debate
if one debate could truly swing an election in the modern age trump would n't have won in 2016
calling for an alternative that is likely to throw the election to trump is why i find it irresponsible there 's no question that we ca n't have a repeat of last night but i ca n't imagine a single candidate who would be able to best trump
they do n’t need to no one who understands politics or has working eyes and ears needs to guys this is the new york times editorial board
you should n’t be waiting for polling after the single worst presidential debate performance of all time you should be moving as quickly as possible to get someone capable out there to replace him
good to see some voices of reason around here lol
it does not follow that he should leave the race the debate increased trump 's chances of winning replacing biden would render trump 's win a virtual certainty we have n't even had time to see comprehensive post debate polls and even then i ca n't see any replacement likely to net more electoral votes than biden not because of them but because of the timing and nature of the switch
and you support their modern day editorial staff what about 22 years ago when they were the most influential media outlet pushing news that saddam had wmd they 're pro corporate and have n't deserved the title ' paper of record ' for decades am i supposed to ignore that because trump attacks them
yeah think before supporting a rapist i agree
you 're right a hail mary is a huge risk but the evidence suggests that it has better odds than staying the course biden is a decent man who does n't deserve this but he must do the honorable thing and step aside to throw his full support behind a candidate who is better suited to meet this terrifying moment
great way to lose in november
this is how clinton supporters sounded in 2016
i truly hope we 're wrong there is nothing foolish about being concerned for the fate of american democracy
how so it ’s not even doomer it ’s realistic trump did n’t win over any new people if anything biden lost votes there will be a lower turnout than 2020 after this performance and the dems ca n’t afford that with how close the race already is
“ vote for hrc ” types looked foolish when they lost in 2016 despite people pleading for another candidate
or you are but by then you wo n’t admit your mistake and it ’ll be too late
they do n’t cover the base of a name who would be able to unite the party the donors and swing independents in a limited timeframe
i 'm kinda on the fence about this but right now i find to be much more persuasive
i thought you meant the nyt having a negative biden spin something that happens daily and has spawned comical things like the new york times pitch bot but no they do n't typically recommend that but he is never in a positive light with the nyt
he sees deceptive videos of biden staring blank faced and now he just saw it on a debate stage that part really sucks those videos were deceptively edited but then biden went out on stage and kept doing the every time he was n't answering a question did himself zero favors
so travel backwards in time and convince americans in 2020 to participate in the democratic primary if they 're under the age of 60 oh you ca n't do that better whine about how we should have better when we had a variety of options and this one was the clear and decisive winner and it was n't even close
same with the world stage an administration can not be a head of state
i 'm under no delusion that this is no big deal it absolutely is a big deal and it f cking sucks i just do n't see how replacing biden can be a winning strategy pushing a candidate in just 4 months and pitting him against an already well established candidate with a an energized cult following can not possibly go well
it 's too late to make a change how do you not understand this there is no other candidate that people know you ca n't pluck a governor from some random state who does n't have national name recognition if they wanted to run it would have been needed over a year ago it is what it is fud wo n't make the situation better
a lot of suspicious usernames with the pattern whose only posts before today last night were in sports subs
i mean he ’s had legislative accomplishments sure but the country is not with him we ’re having legitimate conversations on if he ’s cognitively capable at the aggregate level it seems like a failed presidency
yea the ira and infrastructure bill were great but the aggregate of his presidency seems to have been a failure the country is not with biden we ’re having legitimate conversations on whether he ’s cognitively capable of running the country and on whether he should drop out 4 months prior to the election to give democrats a better shot that ’s not great
she seemed sincere when she said she had no interest in being president besides the 12th amendment states that no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice president of the united states this applies to barack due to the 22nd amendment which prohibits a person from being elected president more than twice
i 'd vote for a 80 year old ham sandwich over trump do you understand that you 're not the kind of person who needs to be convinced to turn out for biden you 're a reliable vote blue no matter who person we get it those people are n't enough to win an election
the issue is n’t me or you our votes are decided and nothing would have ever changed that i have never voted for a republican in my entire life and i ’m a donor we ’re talking about undecided swing voters in swing states it ’s not being fickle being soft is doing nothing do you want to win in november or do you want to give the gop a supermajority in all 3 branches of government
unserious votes count as much as serious votes
i ’m lgbt and after last night am considering voting for trump i know i ’d be watching events unfold from a project25 concentration camp but my reasoning is that i think trump is crazy enough to effectively use nuclear bluffs against putin whereas i do n’t see biden as having the audacity required to blow people up to stop nuclear armageddon have i lost my mind
biden dropped the ball on that and a lot of his followers might not even vote this year which will garner more votes for the orange clown
is he doing anything at the present moment i 'm not referring to what he 'll do if he 's re elected where is isreal getting all their missiles from
lots of people care about the genocide only self entitled brats do n't give a damn
despite everybody knowing trump ca n't to do the job either alas optics matter
for many i doubt who the dem nominee is matters much it objectively does per poll after poll
we got ta stop basing everything on polls polls do n’t have the best predictive value polls reflect a subset of opinions usually landline boomers polls are reflective of things as they are now not as they could be if there was a coordinated and united effort and endorsement from biden to a new candidate they would realistically jump extremely high in the polls and do n’t discount how many nevertrumpers in the gop want to jump ship for someone more reasonable than their felonious candidate but feel that biden is clearly decrepit and declining
i 'm trans myself as it were so i like to think i have a pretty good read on the community and what our general lived experiences are like i 'll freely admit to being biased towards wanting rights and access to healthcare anyways they pretty frequently platform some awful takes and have frequently advocated against us having access to that healthcare like the week after roe v wade fell pamela paul put out an op ed that effectively said well yeah republicans took away your bodily autonomy but democrats support trans people so if you think about it they 're erasing womanhood and hate women just as much as the republicans do lots of queer orgs have put out statements objecting to the times ' coverage here 's a good article on it text a%20group%20of%20more%20than%20130%20lgbtq%20advocates issues%20and%20is%20%22damaging%20to%20the%20paper%27s%20credibility % 22
dude below you is calling the times a “ far right rag ” the delusion is insane
the dnc probably does though which is the whole point
you care enough to comment
this is the kind of naive navel gazing fair and balanced liberal bullshit thinking and i 'm a liberal that 's going to get my trans friends and interracial relationship friends put in camps when trump wins in november the idea that an editorial board should n't think of their audience when writing an editorial is one of the more stupid things i 've read on reddit and i follow a lot of idiotic subreddits
trump is n’t dropping out and his cult is n’t leaving him no editorial is changing that the editorial is written as a much needed alarm to the higher ups in the democratic party that their campaign is is grave trouble
do you think the gop reads listens to the nyt editorial board this whataboutism has got to stop
no their argument is that the trump presidency is a worst case scenario and that biden is utterly incapable of beating him in his current state
why make an argument you know is falling in deaf ears
you 're almost there just keep trying
gavin newsom and frank underwood also initially claimed they did nt want to be president
if biden stepped aside everyone i know would breathe a sigh of relief none of them want trump to win not a single one will care about your admission of weakness
“ look how weak the gop and trump are when we self reflected and saw a problem we fixed it and we got new blood in when the gop has an aging mentally declining felonious rapist nominee they ca n’t do the same ”
biden looked like he was about to die the man that beat medicare reduced to that image is not a good look at one point trump called him out on a fumbled sentence i do n't know what he said at the end of that sentence i do n't think he does either and biden did n't retort
compare this to biden last night and look how far we 've fallen not even the same league there is no point comparing the two performances
someone might think the usa was a fucking joke that train has sailed
i mean do you know our history not only did nixon commit treason that led to the loss of american life but he was only impeached for his cartoonishly stupid wiretapping attempt we 're already a joke just not a very funny one
no one that matters actually believes that tho
you 're not the target of debates
the average american is n’t in this subreddit but a significant amount of people watched last night the margins are already razor thin his approval rating is already low he was already in trouble now if nothing changes trump will be president when the truth is another candidate could destroy him
it just was n’t a bad debate it was the worst debate probably ever he looked incapable of the office he is holding
i think even pete buttigieg could swoop in here
biden has no chance as things are following that debate it 's a guaranteed loss with him as the candidate guaranteed
i thought he absolutely crushed the state of the union i am a biden fan but i ’m also being honest here it ’s not a media narrative it ’s the truth just because we do n’t want it to be the truth does n’t mean we can just blindly ignore what happened we ’re talking about the leader of our country if he was a ceo of a company would he have a job today now imagine a job where you have the nuclear football near you at all times
excuses minnesota produced a decent protest vote no other state could
the present the present just saw an all time disastrous debate performance of course it fuels speculation about the future when the guy who wants to be president until age 86 is visibly not with it anymore at 81 you ca n't claim trump is a danger to democracy he is and then run a guy who clearly does n't know where he is half the time what happens if china attacks taiwan at 3 in the morning and biden is off in la la land this biden is n't 2020 biden and damn sure is n't vp biden from 2008 the best time to replace him was during the primary the next best time is now
i do n't understand this view do n't you think that most people currently backing biden primarily do n't want to vote for trump and that by having a candidate with no questions about their cogency we 'll just have more independents willing to vote for the dem candidate are there really that many people that would vote for biden but not some other younger dem candidate and would n't there be many more people who would be able to vote dem no longer worried about biden 's acuity
so you think they should n’t write what their opinion is even if it ’s true they should just put out whatever propaganda necessary to help biden really
in my opinion the risk of replacing biden and the risk of keeping biden are getting to the point where it ’s equal we ’re in a bad spot let ’s not pretend that we ’re not
what happened to vote blue no matter who centrists have been telling that to me for years and years
polls suggest a generic democrat would perform better vs trump than biden does i do n't think you 're right
biden has the worst chance of beating trump after that debate performance he looked like someone ’s grandpa escaped from the nursing home not someone who should be in charge of the nuclear codes whitmer newsom pritzker or harris would all be stronger candidates now
calling for an alternative that is likely to throw the election to trump is why i find it irresponsible freedom of the press literally the first right in the bill of rights
but can biden do the job i am having my doubts
voter apathy the cause of hillary loss is the problem not people switching sides
man i wish y all would seriously read the article you attempt to criticize
do you think the nyt board is supporting trump with this article they 're requesting he step down so a better candidate can replace him
but the evidence suggests that it has better odds than staying the course push polls focused on boomers in floribama does n't constitute evidence dems have been over performing on polls by 5 10 points the past few years and abortion rights will be on many ballots no matter how desperate trump and putin are to push the narrative that an incumbent president will lose to a guy he already beat biden should n't and is n't going to step down
evidence suggests it has better odds what evidence there 's no other candidates or data to base that on we 're in june of an election year there 's no time for that
any other candidate at this point is a sure fire loss there is no other candidate
or cult 45ers in 2020 right
we 're not running clinton tho biden already beat trump we 're just biden supporters doing the same exact race
i know their heart is in the right place so i am not angry or anything but they 're going to have an easy november and will look back on these events and feel a little foolish that 's all
the realistic outlook is that dobbs changed the electorate and the election is already over for trump been over since that decision
honestly it 's june and there will be 10 more crazy things that happen between now and election day literally anything could happen jail sex scandal one or both candidates could easily die everything is in play any declarative statements today are just an invitation to look foolish later the supreme court may very well declare trump immune from prosecution on monday and we 'll have something new to digest this ride is just getting started
dementia donny absolutely lost votes did you even watch the debate he was rambling about post birth abortions and we had the best h20
biden already beat trump and is running a worse campaign with a more pro democratic electorate
it 's not my mistake to make biden is the one making this call
it feels pretty obvious what the choices are in order of likelihood harris has a mandate having previously been elected to explicitly be biden 's backup president can seamlessly message about continuing the biden admin 's agenda has more name recognition than any other option and being a member of the biden harris campaign she can continue to use the funds that they 've already raised which none of the other candidates would be able to do whitmer popular rust belt governor in a swing state newsom charismatic young and articulate clearly angling for the job biggest downside is the coastal california elite label he 'll have to wear jb pritzker wealthy candidate that can independently fund his campaign very popular in his home state but has the same issue newsom has about his state having a bad reputation in middle america i think any of them would be better than biden at this stage he 's cooked
i agree with this the deluge of “ newsom ” feels like a 4d chess psyop because all they have to say is “ california ” and “ had dinner in a restaurant during peak covid ” and he ’s cooked against trump
while he has good points about the disadvantages of losing the incumbent and the lack of an alternative who would clearly beat trump abramson is clearly coping about the severity of the situation by saying trump ’s 2020 debate performance was worse and that debates do n’t matter i ’ve never seen media coverage of a debate like this one this is different and we need to accept that to make level headed decisions going forward
they literally endorsed him in 2020
do you even remember how the 2020 primary unfolded biden was getting trounced before a ton of dnc operatives most notably james clyburne endorsed him all at once and started pushing this narrative that he ’s the only one who can win moderates and challenge trump the same spin was used to keep hillary as the nominee in 2016 it ’s beyond obvious there is a serious seniority issue in the democratic party and telling people to suck it up and vote for the lesser evil does n’t work when you pull this shit every 4 years without a break the last genuinely popular dem candidate was obama that was 16 years ago
surely blaming voters 4 years ago for having a president who ca n’t coherently respond to his opponent will fire up the electorate
gavin newsom and witmere are both capable that ’s an insane take
hand waving away those legislative accomplishments so easily seems a bit ridiculous i did n't think he should run for reelection and i 'd love to see him drop out but that does n't mean this whole term was inconsequential or a failure
i do n’t think he ’s cognitively incapable of being president at the moment i just do n’t think he ’s cognitively capable of running a winning campaign and communicating a winning message
the country is not with biden based on what inaccurate polling data legitimate conversations none of these conversations are legitimate he 's not going anywhere it 's insane anyone thinks otherwise it 's not realistic in june of an election year
read the 22nd amendment it does n't prohibit anyone from being president but elected this is why it is possible and would end up in court
bingo it does not matter how many college educated supporters biden has in new york city it is the undecided in pennsylvania that matter those folks are almost certainly going to see that performance as reinforcing what they heard about biden being too old
hillary destroyed trump in the debates did everything biden was supposed to do made no difference was it bad of course but dems are weak to be so apoplectic and hysterical and self defeatist out in the open but it definitely is on brand as i said i prefer to see this election cycle for what it is biden 's campaign has communicated the stakes and no matter how faulty the choice is will the voter want to hear it over tang hitler 's hate and blather or not no matter what anyone thinks about last night the choice is still clear and no amount of crying about one early bad debate is going to help win the election but that 's just me
that i understand but he would of dropped the ball regardless no us president has ever got it right regarding the middle east i actually applaud his effort to some extent he assisted both sides no matter the consequence or side he will lose some voters he gains voters like me voting for the first time for being presidential and not jumping the gun like bush did with iraq
there will be no pleasing you with any answer we do n't control that situation and no amount of moaning and whining about biden will fix it and trump will be worse
does it generic democrats poll better than biden but specific democrats have n't iirc
we should just base it on vibes then that 'll really do it s
it ’s okay good even for platforms to share a diverse set of ideas that you do n’t always agree with
this is a special place
you ’re 100 % right biden would have to step aside for it to be an open convention at that point people would want to run
put in camps not overly dramatic at all
because you 're a terminally online redditor who 's likely friends with other terminally online redditors quite frankly you do n't matter in terms of campaigning the kind of people that care about trump looked stronger would be the ones that would think the dnc is admitting weakness by having biden back out
trump said the us is a third world country and a bunch of other crazy things
maybe i should have written in 2012 i was absolutely concerned about obama 's competence in that debate because his normally greatest strength at being an orator was not there
good thing one bad debate does n't actually matter in the long term he bounced back in energy literally immediately afterwards he was getting his ideas and policies across during the debate itself even while he was muttering and stuttering and the only soundbites anyone has been talking about are both in favor of him trying to get some new guy that most of the population has never thought about for a second before and get enough of them excited enough to vote for them in 4 months is not possible so instead of doing the doom and gloom routine get out there present all the good policies and decisions biden has had remind people what 's at stake if trump worms his way back into the white house and fucking vote for biden
and a certain other candidate is getting sentenced in two weeks for 37 felonies where ’s the nyt editorial biden made more work for himself and surrogates here no doubt about that but anyone who thinks it ’s worth a huge risky disruption is in an over reactive panic mode
i 'm not voting for biden because of biden i 'm voting for him because the alternative is a convicted felon that does nothing but lie reddit is not reality
calling what they say irresponsible is n't me contending with their first amendment rights lmao
if he does become incompetent there is a system for him to step down or be removed even if he does n't his cabinet would not let anything go seriously far astray reagan may or may not have had undiagnosed alzheimer 's in the latter part of his term but he did have dementia and there was n't a noticeable change in policy making i strongly suspect biden 's mental health will be good at the end of another term i overwhelmingly suspect that replacing him will lead to another trump presidency i know that another trump presidency would be a disaster
ding ding this is what i 'm terrified of noone who was going to vote for biden is going to magically vote for trump but the double haters are gon na stay home and that 's enough for trump to win in the electoral college
never said people switched sides apathy is a different kind of gross people sitting quietly and allowing a rapist to pin down lady liberty and force her legs open sorry i would n’t allow it would you people like that are pathetic
right they obviously think trump should drop out but nyt only carries weight with left leaning people and some independents maga does not care at all about the nyt says their opinion carries no weight with the maga crowd
i did there was no plan beyond dropping out that scenario helps trump where is this better candidate i wish y all would seriously read the article and think about it
the times is in the business of news would biden stepping down be news and nyt lost its reputation since the wmd lies these are points known to people into politics this is n’t the nba
trump is winning in identified by realclear polling with the other one being a tie nate silver fivethirtyeight gives trump a two to one odds even on the issue of protecting democracy a central issue for biden 's campaign more than biden 44 % to 33 % think about that shit for a second i know where we are on the election calendar in a past life i built a career working on campaigns and i know that the convention when the actual selection will take place is in 52 days
i do n’t believe that current polling numbers may not be great for the replacement but that ’s because most people do n’t know who newsom or whitmer are give democrats 4 months and a debate with trump with a new candidate and things can change politics is n’t static
and biden is clearly not the same man he was
that right there is exactly the hubris that handed trump the presidency the first time around
what makes you say this
that ’s just outright foolish confidence in the face of glaring reality the swing vote dumbasses that will decide this election are telling you they ’re not going to vote for the geezer and you ’re like “ yeah you will it ’s already over ”
and after last night keeping him will assure that trump beats biden
you ’re saying that people are overreacting and that when people see biden win in november they ’ll look foolish i m saying that is a mistake
people here still do n't want to admit the dnc rigged the primary against bernie sanders
only in america would good but not perfect and i 'll burn this entire fucking thing to the ground be a 50 0001 vs 49 9999 toss up who would i blame except for voters and non voters the only people responsible for the outcome and the only people that can fix it if you 're angry as shit about 4 years ago you take the lesson and become extremely politically active for the rest of your life because elections have long term consequences that you just have to take on the chin or you do the same stupid shit over and over again and make posts like you just did
surely coming onto reddit or any social media for that matter and not rallying behind your party because you ’re still mad about hillary also does n’t do a goddamn thing
they are n't newsom wo n't play outside of ca as he 's the coastal elite that right leaning folks decry and nobody knows whitmer she 's does n't have national name recognition and wo n't get it in 4 months let alone have the experience to take on trump on the debate stage this is it this is the guy insanity is thinking you can pluck a candidate into the race who did n't show up to the primary a year ago
i mean it ’s easy to hand waive accomplishments away when the country does not appear to share enthusiasm in those accomplishments again this man is the least popular president in modern history at this point in his presidency if he loses or steps down he ’s gon na be seen as a carter like president
those are both big parts of being a president
data i do n’t agree with inaccurate data love how that works at the aggregate level biden has a 38 2 % approval rating for comparison trump was at 39 9 % at this point in his presidency the nyt editorial board is literally calling for him to step down these are legitimate conversations that article is not released in a vacuum this is a sign that those conversations are taking place in the background
it was historically bad you are fooling yourself
no you base it on strategy and you effectively message
right but in this case i think they 're just straight up wrong because i know what it 's like to be a trans person and in such a way that 's hostile to my continued existence they also generally do n't platform trans voices or even pro trans opinions
no offense but this comment could not more clearly display the fact that there is no actual fucking plan for what to do with biden drops out that right there should convince you that it 's a terrible idea but somehow seems not to have done that if there is no person who can reasonably step in who can build a campaign apparatus necessary to win and who is nationally well known enough that they have a shot at winning you are guaranteeing a trump victory period i am just baffled as to how you can not see this and still keep insisting that biden has to drop out if you can not identify an actual named person who is ready to go and who would be better than stop saying he should drop out
my friends have no idea what 's happening on reddit
dude come on you started by saying people thought obama looked tired in the first debate of 2012 i point out that biden looked extremely unwell and now the topic of discussion is trump said weird things biden is clearly and undeniably unwell he looked like he was dying and said things that could not be understood as complete sentences he was mocked by his opponent in stage for it you may still be prepared to vote for him i get that you want ' not trump ' to win and you 're voting for that person in november that person does not need to be biden
my point is that this is no ordinary case of losing the first debate then coming back to win the second one biden was out of it on that stage in a way i have never seen on a debate stage referencing obama 's 2012 campaign is nothing more than copium
i ’m not the voter you should be worried about lol i am a california lifelong democrat we ’re talking about undecided swing state voters who literally despite all of that are still considering voting for him
so you 'd vote for another democrat in his place too
you 're suggesting that the press should n't publish things that might politicians or parties would find hurtful that 's literally why freedom of the press was enshrined in the constitution
well it happened 8 years ago and it can happen again undeniably so because its almost the same electoral mass and democrats are fighting a trump that got more votes in 2020 than in 2016 and biden is being outperformed by his own party in states where democrats win you can call them pathetic gross whatever but the reality wo nt change because of that
if someone posted the nyt article saying trump 's unfit for office there would be 500 comments saying no shit and they 're just now realizing this
nyt carries weight with righties who read it as a sort of kremlinology current theory is that this was all orchestrated in advance that the early debate was designed to allow biden to be pushed out before the convention my mom spent 20 minutes on the phone trying to convince me of it today as usual they are giving the democratic party way too much credit
nate silver is n't at 538 and has a long history of being incorrect 538 gives it a 50 50 right now and beyond that polling skews older and republican so it 's inaccurate at best there 's no evidence that suggests a new candidate would fare any better and before you roll out the dead horse that is but whitmer and newsom no just no
repeating wha someone else said above four months is n't enough time to run a twelve month campaign the logistics alone would give any prospective candidate a heart attack it would be political suicide replacing biden now and deep down everyone knows it
he 's pretty much the same but has a better record now as president
they 're the same candidates with a better electorate for biden there is n't any question about that
dobbs was a shift in the electorate and it 's going to cost the republicans more elections than this one our entire society is ignoring women but their votes get counted the same
can you address the fact that democrats keep beating polling in actual elections is there a reason to think that will stop
i have no reason to think the post dobbs electorate change was impacted by last nights debate
most likely no things are never as bad as they seem
okay makes sense thanks i still plan on phone banking in battleground states hope you consider doing that too
biden voters are n’t nearly as insane as trump ones but a lot of them seem convinced that he ’s one of the greatest presidents ever they ca n’t seem to understand that biden has mostly stumbled his way here biden was n’t even in the top 3 dems in terms of polling before everybody suspiciously dropped out and endorsed him that ’s fucking embarrassing for a former vice president
how are the voters supposed to remedy the current crisis we ’re in now with an extremely unpopular democratic candidate confronting a straight up villain it ’s absolutely in the party ’s and biden ’s hands to present the case that there is fit democratic leadership for this country here
what are you even talking about right now i want the democrats to prevail in this election the new york times editorial board pretty explicitly wants the same to do that we need a winning strategy and a candidate who is strong enough to make the clear case to undecided voters and those indifferent to this election why it matters biden was fully incapable of delivering that last night
well people were n't excited about the affordable care act right away either but that does n't mean it did n't do a lot of good people love it now trump 's fight to overturn it was incredibly unpopular and even the supreme court would n't do it despite multiple opportunities i do n't think you need enthusiasm to call a win a win you just ca n't make it the backbone of your reelection argument you have to promise more for the future and also tell people how you 're gon na get it done
aggregate polling is still based on inaccurate polling polling has n't been accurate since before 2016 because they do n't poll any of the voting bases that matter it 's all based on landline phones which skew older and more republican no they 're not legitimate because saying step aside is n't a solution there 's no viable candidate to replace with so it 's just an insane idea might as well just say concede the race now and hand it over to trump on a platter
sure i can witmere and newsom both would destroy trump it ’s absolutely insane that you think biden is the best option you are in a very small minority of people who still believe this
but but but vibes man no you hit the nail on the head we do not have a single candidate who could build the needed momentum in time for november
no i said i remember watching the debate and obama seemed exhausted or had something wrong with him i was n't aware of the next debate he did much better you changed topics so i did too biden has a stutter you can probably find an example of him saying something wrong in many speeches or debates i remember him doing that plenty of times most of what he said especially in the last half was much easier to follow than what trump said
i 'm not referencing it the guy you originally responded to did i simply disagree with obama lost that debate but did not raise questions about his intelligence or competence in the process based on what i remember feeling and thinking at the time it did raise those questions i bet you could find articles about that from that time which talks about that
it ’s june lots of time to get them in the fold and guess what every time trump opens his mouth people hate him more if you think a democratic civil war between kamala and newsom or whatever drama results is pulling anyone over the line that ’s ridiculous
there ’s a bizarre tendency amongst biden loyalists to tell you how they ’d vote for anybody that is n’t donald trump and you do n’t have to like biden just vote for him but there ’s also a massive constituency for biden such that no other democrat could win besides him
well if the editorial board is concerned about preserving democracy it should probably avoid endorsing something that would hand the election to a candidate threatening the foundation of our government as doing so is indeed irresponsible
well at least your user name checks out there 's really not much i can say to somebody who has their head that deep in the sand best of luck to quote lord varys i hope i 'm wrong edited to fix the quote
where were you when some advocated that biden step down before the primaries so it was n’t too late you probably said “ it ’s too early we do n’t have correct polling yet ” now it is “ too late ” it ’s not too late political suicide is letting biden lose to trump
you ’re asking us to do what trump asked people to do about jan6 and covid to not believe our eyes and our ears my dude biden is cooked it ’s joever edit i will of course vote for whoever the dem nominee is do n’t get me wrong and i have appreciated biden ’s policies but i just do n’t think he can win
i would like you to revisit videos of the 2020 debates and meditate on the nature of human mortality
except all available polling data we have but sure
we literally already had a trump presidency following a campaign filled with democratic arrogance about their electoral consequences have we learned nothing
definitely yes that was bad it was terrible biden needs to be replaced
appreciate the respectful response will definitely not be phone banking or supporting biden in any way get rid of biden and you can win so many voters back
for this election and moving forward only not only do you have to go all in on biden you have to go start knocking doors and convincing people that your country 's on the brink of ending or whine on reddit and still be here in 7 years whining about supreme god emporor djt jr drafting your entire family because you did n't suck him off publicly while blaming the dnc
if you legitimately think biden is popular you ’re in an echo chamber within an echo chamber there ’s plenty of viable candidates whitmer and newsom for example time is of the essence if he ’s gon na drop would need to be this week
i actually do n't believe either of them would beat trump newsome is nationally known but he is not universally liked that 's for sure and i say that as someone who has voted for him more than once whitmire is not nationally known and it would be a struggle to change that in just 4 months i ca n't imagine that midwesterners who are reluctant to pull the lever for biden are suddenly going to turn around and do so when it 's gavin newsom running instead i do n't know if you know this but outside of the west coast many people do not hold california in high regard even if they are democrats lol this all fails to understand the underlying dynamic of the race which is that exactly as in 2020 nobody is really voting for the democratic candidates they are voting against trump there 's no reason to believe that has changed and no reason to believe that substituting a different horse in the race here at the very end is a smart move and every reason to believe that it 's a bad move and should n't be done unless absolutely necessary so yes bad plan poorly thought out and it 's not going to happen so you might as well forget about it
you do n’t think gavin newsom or witmere could insane you think someone does n’t have time to build momentum it ’s june
you changed topics so i did too when
gaslighting yourself and others is n’t helpful it gives right wing talking heads an easy win because this time they ’re right biden is senile it was clear to everyone watching do n’t combat lies with more lies
ah ok so you think the limitation of freedom of the press should be that they need to consult your crystal ball to make sure their article does n't single handedly throw an election should all newspapers avoid endorsing candidates then would n't want to risk throwing the entire election by exercising their right to free speech it 's amazing that you 're able to predict the impact of events and the outcome of an election that does n't happen until november truly a gift
insisting there 's another candidate or that he should step aside into a void where there is no candidate is having your head in the sand there 's no realistic alternative this late in the cycle 4 months is not enough time to run a 12 month campaign
it 's one bad debate relax
yeah the polling has been really bad and the actual elections show the shift
i do n't get the logic of that biden is n't dropping out
i ’m voting for biden i understand the stakes i ’m also not naive enough to believe he ’s making a convincing case against trump you can call the voters stupid all you want for not doing the heavy lift themselves to support an unpopular candidate but i guarantee you that will not be an effective strategy
you 've spelled her name incorrectly 3 or 4 times which only weakens your own argument i like her i d vote for her she absolutely would not beat trump
maybe you need to get a cognitive test when you responded to my comment about obama 's bad debate you changed topics to the debate last night i remember being especially worried in 2012 because obama can be a great orator and that debate made it seem like that was no longer the case
i thought they both did terribly biden takes more heat when he makes mistakes because people do n't care enough that trump is a compulsive liar a fraud convicted felon etc
it ’s not about debate performance it ’s about that he confirmed everyone ’s concerns about his age go back and watch it he literally pivots from his strongest topic abortion and starts incoherently rambling about immigrant murderers he ’s gaping his mouth he shuffle walks he can barely speak he could n’t have done worse unless he shat himself or had a stroke on stage it ’s not about debates it ’s about seeing him laid bare
polling has been really bad polling in the last election cycle midterms had the least amount of polling errors in decades and was historically accurate actual elections you can not compare low turnout special elections to a presidential election essentially every political expert keeps saying this there 's no correlation between an election where 12 % of highly engaged voters turnout versus a presidential election at all you 're high on some serious copium
that ’s a sure fire way to lose to trump
it 's not just about doing the heavy lifting for this shit candidate it is acknowledging the undeniable fact that elections have serious consequences that ca n't be undone by whining about it the negative situation the country faces now is the fault of political leadership and a populace that is satisfied with corruption and at best mediocrity if you have the option of a papercut and having your leg snapped it is not reasonable to break your leg because more competent leadership would have given you a bandaid it is emotional and reactionary like fascism if you ignore your democracy you lose it and whining about it while it 's happening and doing nothing about it does n't help
you do n't need to spell her name correctly if she 's on the ballot you ca n't confuse whitmer and trump lmao
dog this post is about the debate last night and how biden 's performance was so bad he should withdraw from the race i understand that talking about obama doing poorly in his first debate in 2012 give you hope and saying trump said some strange things helps but obama did n't look like he was dying i could understand all the words trump was using i watched those debates too what happened last night is not normal and claiming it is is unhealthy
do the crime do the time see i can make fun rhymes for trump you convicted felon
dear trump stop raping people wait guess that does n’t rhyme
has anyone told trump that
either trump represents a existential threat to democracy and we should be bucking traditions to mount a strong engaged cultural movement in defense of democracy or trump is easily beatable and we can coast on tradition and trod out a geriatric gape jawed grandpa with a speech impediment who alienates young voters one is reality one is delusion
nah it ’s going to be so sweet when old grandpa joe crushes the orange turd
we really need to boycott this company if they only want conservatives in their audience then so be it nytimes is doing the same thing so see ya nytimes is probably going to go out business soon anyways i guess no loss there
unless the author of this op ed wrote a similar one after donny 's convictions then we should ignore everything they have to say nothing they do is in good faith
how do you go with dear joe instead of hey joe
cnn go fuck yourself the weapons grade journalistic fuckery you displayed in this 90 minute trump campaign commercial lie a thon was not something you 'll get away with
i know this will get down voted into oblivion but here it goes anyway you all have exalted biden with all his major accomplishments in the past three years especially with a divided congress and rightly so if you need a refresher check out r whathasbidendone yet your support falters after one shitty debate without giving him the benefit of the doubt that it was at an unfortunate event for all to see though i do n’t know much about horse racing biden may have stalled at the gate stumbled on the track but he got up to finish the race he had a poor showing but he ’s still my horse
cnn made their position clear by failing to fact check the lying felon master debater
these anti biden anti american propagandists can go f themselves people who want to harm america are trying to boost trump
opinion dear cnn it 's time for jake tapper and his weak sauce moderation to go
begun have the bot wars just knew once the debates happened the bots would start swarming with their disingenuous concerned liberal posts and others
i hate him for running
the host of the debate claims this after not fulfilling the mediator role in the debate gtfo cnn
you have a replacement or you suggestion or are you stating that the orange diaper wearing convicted felon should be our choice
joe has got to go so that trump ca n't get um i suck at rhyming trump should n't be president and biden is n't the right pick
united states is fucked with these two candidates they did n't learn with ronald reagan with alzheimers they are too old and one is a criminal
biden has done the job well for one term keep going joe
in my fanfiction bernie is brought out of the hat in a redemption arc spannin back to 2016 he then activates all the zoomers and millennials crushes the election and entirely wipes out the toxic maga movement he then fucks the corps to hold them accountable introduces actual worker 's rights not this benefits nonsense fixes us democracy by introducing proportional representation etc
dear jay f off see anyone can rhyme
incumbent advantage is too important right now john kerry won all his debates against bush and did n't change anything
i hope he stands but joe biden is n’t fit
interestingly his performance seems to be endearing undecideds towards joe
a lot of y' all delusional like biden he does need to go dnc digging it 's own grave
kamala major pete hillary many options
i ’m not sure he will after last night tbh i ’m not sure he ’s really able to read the room it ’s a bummer because if he does n’t step aside trump is very likely going to win remember trump was favored to win before this debate albeit slightly either someone else ’s runs in his stead someone popular young and sharp or we get trump again any thoughts to the contrary are really just copium biden is popular on reddit but he is n’t popular in america
let ’s go joe time for you to retire
he really needs to drop out
imo bernie bros were not the proximate cause but the ones that ultimately got us here we had to have several of the more viable 2020 candidates fall on their swords on super tuesday and get behind biden to avoid running a straight up socialist against an incumbent i would have voted for klobuchar over biden if that were an option by the time the primaries got around to my late state bernie voters just ca n’t seem to realize some of his policies are n’t very popular nor his inability to compromise
he would be doing the time if biden had the courage to fulfill his duties as commander and chief by holding trump accountable for the coup attempt
are you actually deluded enough to think a poet who protested the iraq war is secretly working for trump
pointing out how awful trump is only highlights how important it is that joe drops out any candidate that can consistently form complete sentences would beat trump trump did absolutely awful last night but still won handily
me when i ca n’t accept that last night was a disaster
it does n't even matter whether we consider trump easily beatable if there 's a chance trump could be elected and his election 's predicted to be that catastrophic the dem leadership should be pulling out all the stops to make sure that catastrophic possibility does n't come to pass
what is the upside of running the empty husk of joe biden over the qualified and sharp other options out there
democrats we can not fool ourselves we are not allegiant to a man as great as a president as he ’s been the man leading our party is unfit to be a major party nominee biden not stepping aside is hubris period trump must be defeated and biden is not up to the job
are democrats really dumb enough to risk the most humiliating loss in modern political history because they refuse to do the right thing and get biden out this is absolutely ridiculous
the candidate that replaces joe
survey usa had biden 2 points below trump post debate so yeah that 's possible within the range of fluctuation we 've seen in the polls
bittersweet for us who will be here to remind you he should have stepped aside hopium is not a strategy
championing the one democrat that ’s most likely to lose against trump because he ’s broadly unpopular is a horrible strategy
looks like he did write an op ed like that
how is it not possible to see that the reason you write this is because you recognize that the majority of republicans are so right wing as to be unreachable so it 's better to appeal to the side you 're ostensibly on to find a better candidate to beat them as it stands i do n't think dems or at least biden care what anyone thinks and joe will remain the candidate as much due to status within the party as anything else but it 's more likely than getting republicans to drop trump
it 's worse then that cnn has been taken over by conservatives it was a slow roll until last night we have to just stop pretending that cnn is credible these days as it 's clearly not cable tv is dying and they 're trying to soak up as much money as they can before it completely dies so they have to try to draw the faux news viewers in
i 'm glad i 'm not the only one where were the fact checks so they lied to us i 'm done with cnn that 's a bridge way too far for me what they did was so incredibly dishonest that i can not in good conscious recommend cnn ever again multiple news figures also used the time to call for joe biden to step down while they pretend to be democrats which would result in trump winning by default at this point in time it 's too much i can not listen to that type of complete and utter dishonest nonsense and i will not ever listen to it again cnn is a propaganda mill now and i am totally done with them
how could you watch that debate and think the moderators were the problem trump had no opponent for stretches of the debate it ’s not the moderators job to debate trump
was expecting this to be the top comment after the fucked things up with no fact checking what a shit show
you ’re posturing as if people are abandoning biden they ’re not i have not seen or heard one person say that last night ’s debate made them change their vote one way or another however people are rightfully pointing out just how bad the optics of last night were for biden i ’m vote blue no matter who but i can also recognize how atrocious that performance was on a superficial level
i mean i 'm pretty sure the concern is n't just one shitty debate if that was it that 's workable the concern is that the debate exposed some serious concerns about biden 's age and whether he is physically and mentally able to be president for another 4 years
i listen to the potus channel on sirius weeks ago one of the hosts journalist made a comment about prominent democrats pushing back hard whenever journalists talked about president biden 's current health he did n't stall at the gate this is ongoing
yeah i can remember tapper telling the audience after their disastrous town hall with trump that the people needed to be open to other points of view sounds like a corporate mouthpiece
keep ignoring voter apathy that worked well in 2016
i 'm curious which posts comments you think are from bots and which ones you think are disingenuous
same he was clearly too old last time
two things can both be true it can be true that cnn dropped the ball by not fact checking trump and it can also be true that the debate exposed some serious concerns about biden 's age
not sure if you read the article but the author suggested 3 possibilities michigan gov gretchen whitmer california gov gavin newsom and illinois gov j b pritzker not to mention the obvious vp kamala harris
just stop focusing on the individual that is us specific nonsense biden has a far more competent cabinet which is why he is largely successful the personality is only important for the election which is stupid but when it comes to governing its bigger than that so even if biden is in coma during his entire presidency its still better than the sycophantic lunatics trump wants to entrench
i mean he 's older than biden
this extremism is why dems lost to trump in the first place do n’t advocate for splitting the vote
i really think it would be the ideal time to let the bernie people shoot their shot i can not imagine another candidate that would instantly garner a new wave of enthusiasm other than maybe jon stewart himself
incumbent advantage is usually shown in polls which uh have you seen the polls they are bad they have been bad and they are going to get worse
incumbent advantage is too important right now you 're okay being governed by unelected aides and cabinet members the president is not up to the task vice president harris has not had a prominent role in this term and there is no indication she 'll have one in the next that leaves unelected politicians running things president biden wo n't be making many unscripted speeches after last night he wo n't be talking to world leaders some of whom will manipulate the situation to their benefit there are no great choices choosing another candidate is the only viable choice that preserves the voters right to make an informed decision
actually it 's been trump 's negative antics in combination with biden 's positive comments
it 's because some people watched more than just a few minutes of it and could see with their own eyes that what the media is saying is nothing more than hysterics and theater
probably because trump 's performance was also awful but it was maybe less notable since trump has always been like that
what exactly would you like potus to do serious question
its bizarre that these people on reddit are so attached to biden when he has such a poor chance of beating trump it 's almost like they are secretly working for trump
not if you took the time to read the transcripts take the messengers out of the equation and look at the actual substance of the dialogue and report back
yeah this sub has a lot of centrist dems who cling to tradition for identity but i just do n't believe minimal effort is enough this time around i actually believe a great threat justifies a great defense
the joe biden we saw last night is not the man he was even 4 years ago watch his 2020 debates and then watch yesterday and tell me with a straight face nothing has changed
trump has had two fights won once lost once only savior white jesus neo biden captain america can save us that 's not the rational argument you think it is
one his third attempt for the presidency this will be the fourth time he has tried to be president he 's currently getting a 33 % which is an f in all scales he could n't even get democrats on his side 66 % of the time and was not nominated
trump also only lost to one person why do you think somebody else could n't win statistically it 's 50 50 shot clinton was also very unpopular and had a lot of baggage almost any other democrat could have beat trump
i 've voted democrat my entire adult life and at this point i do not feel it is morally or ethically responsible for me vote for biden i would gladly support any of the proposed choices and i think a lot of other people would as well all year all polls have been saying people are concerned about biden 's age and do n't like either of their choices why not just try giving them another choice it 's unconventional but i think worth the risk when the consequence is the most humiliating loss in history like you said
not sure that 's the link you meant to copy it 's an article about renaming dulles airport
so it 's better to appeal to the side you 're ostensibly on to find a better candidate to beat them seems like a double standard republicans need to appeal to the center too
they did before non of those voters are going back to trump or staying home as if you hated trump or wanted him gone before him and his cult and the gop enablers and sycophants are even worse than in 2020 you have millions of votes from reliable voters basically on lock we will be tossing that all aside and just hoping most of them will vote for a dem replacement or for younger generations or other voters that are less reliable to recognize the existential threat and actually vote
it 's the moderators job to keep the candidates honest cnn deserves to be sued into oblivion for trying to pose as journalists
it 's not about people changing teams and more about the people who will once again fuck off entirely because this process is dismal and yields nothing
yes i am “ posturing as if people are abandoning biden ” i went to bed last night feeling horribly disappointed after the debate woke up to find this whole sub littered with articles on how he should immediately step down who should replace him and if he does n’t then invoking the 25th every comment that even questioned or had an opinion like mine let alone actually outright supported the man was obliterated for the morning i thought we had become the conservative sub and wondered when we were going to become “ flaired users only ” i do n’t think it was all due to brigadiering sp but please look at all he has accomplished under difficult circumstances is he the perfect candidate at this point in time yes he is
the ones they do n’t enjoy reading
i did read it and those are good suggestions i think we 're just a little late in the game for that to happen sadly
that ’s fine but this garbage brained skeleton may not be able to keep it together well enough to get re elected to be a better president than trump you have to actually get elected president and last night he magnified the little drops of concern voters have about his age and mental state
the personality is only important for the election which is stupid but when it comes to governing its bigger than that so even if biden is in coma during his entire presidency its still better than the sycophantic lunatics trump wants to entrench ok so why not field a candidate that is not comatose and still rely on the cabinet to do things
then we 'd have unelected aides and cabinet members with their own separate agendas governing us biden would be the one with the football biden would be the one with wall to wall secret service protection biden would be the one to meet with other world leaders when those are given over to the unelected without the president 's approval that 's dangerous president biden needs to be replaced
sure but he does n't seem older he still speaks well has energy etc while biden looked 15 years older than trump in the debate
they lost to trump because they put forward a deeply unpopular candidate who ran her campaign with an arrogant assumption of victory
he could n't form a sentence last night which debates were you watching not one job in america would hire biden to work for them yet that 's the democrats candidate for president of the united states of america
cable news brain i have to assume
how many voters you think are reading the transcripts lol let ’s be real
yeah surely the most critical voters who will decide the election will go and read the fucking transcripts jfc
ok good point let me take a look at the transcripts we ’d be able to right wipe out his debt we ’d be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do child care elder care making sure that we continue to strengthen our health care system making sure that we ’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what i ’ve been able to do with the covid excuse me with dealing with everything we have to do with look if we finally beat medicare look there ’s so many young women who have been including a young woman who just was murdered and he he went to the funeral the idea that she was murdered by a by by an immigrant coming in and they talk about that but here ’s the deal there ’s a lot of young women who are being raped by their by their in laws by their by their spouses brothers and sisters by just it ’s just it ’s just ridiculous and they can do nothing about it and they tried to arrest them when they cross state lines oh
seriously do the transcripts cover how confused he looks or how frequently he fumbled sentences send me an edited transcript so i can see what you 're seeing
okay he has better positions on every issue i care about his failure to communicate them ca n't be overstated
that 's too much work for people like him and trump supporters
but that ’s not how casual observers swing voters undecided are likely to digest the debate though
and these same centrist will pull out everything to undermine and remove a progressive suddenly tradition or decorum do nt matter
i was referring to the second part of it that trump should go to rikers the person who wrote the op ed clearly thinks trump is unqualified to be the nominee after his criminal convictions
i mean it 's not a double standard to say that republicans should appeal to the center too but that realistically they wo n't be doing that anytime soon
republicans never will they 're fucking insane and always will be and they can win that way too as long as democrats run wishy washy middle of the road candidates who appeal to no one and make left wing voters stay home democrats only claim the centrist strategy works because it 's all they try and eventually republicans are so lunatic they push people into democratic arms and then the dems call this proof their strategy works and not proof they would have won running on almost any given platform
united states is fucked with these two candidates i was responding to this claim and if biden were to win and then fall into a coma us would still largely still be in good hands because his cabinet is n't insane the same is not true for that orange piece of shit besides that biden should retire
after last night this sounds familiar
you forgot the pied piper strategy that cunning plan whereby trump was deliberately elevated as a candidate in the belief that he 'd be easier to beat than the other options
the dsa fucked america hillary was a great candidate that made sense for rational people dsa and maga are the same levels of nonsense
and democratic primary voters myself included would take that over a self described democratic socialist
from the same people who brought you “ it ’s her turn ” comes the hit sequel that is 8 years in the making presenting “ yes biden is going to lose but trump is worse so make him the nominee anyways ”
how many people do you think are watching the debates and not getting pre made takes from tiktok and reddit
well you are overstating them so there 's that
if biden stays in the race the message that will be heard by the public is that it 's not that important to beat trump
what other job or company in america would hire joe biden the answer is 0 yet he 's running for president clown show
uh huh but umm where did call for the rnc to replace him after the conviction
but no one seems concerned that their lack of doing so will cost them elections
and they can win that way too as long as democrats run wishy washy middle of the road candidates who appeal to no one and make left wing voters stay home enough bullshit if that does n't apply to republicans it does n't apply democrats democrats only claim the centrist strategy works because it 's all they try and eventually you need to read downs 1957 republicans are so lunatic they push people into democratic arms and then the dems call this proof their strategy works and not proof they would have won running on almost any given platform yes in a single member winner take all races it 's rational to pick the candidate closest to your political position that 's how rational behavior works
ya she was also snotty and condescending and spoke like she was holier than thou personality and likability is important in an election
you 're in the wrong subreddit dude you must have meant to post this in the other reality the one where democratic primary voters like yourself did n't pick the person who lost to donald trump
hope you were happy with trump ’s four years
he could n't complete a sentence last night but okay
i 'm not aware of that specific claim for the rnc to replace him after the conviction but this author is pretty clearly acting in good faith i seriously doubt he is saying this because he 's a trump supporter
the last point is that any position would win in an election against a party that ca n't win because everyone hates what they are doing in power center left far left center right etc for instance across the pond you could probably dig up jimmy saville and he would beat rishi sunak right now
and sanders contributed to that loss by staying in long after he had been defeated by clinton trying to usurp the will of the majority of democratic primary voters at the convention while inspiring a toxic and delusional loyalty among his base
no one whose calling for biden to step aside now but did n't call for trump to do so is not acting in good faith
the last point is that any position would win in an election against a party that ca n't win because everyone hates what they are doing in power in a distribution of political preferences there 's no such thing center left far left center right etc for instance across the pond you could probably dig up jimmy saville and he would beat rishi sunak right now that 's wrong too the concept of an incumbency advantage is very real and well documented
ah yes blame your failed candidate on bernie voters lol
incumbency advantage is real but i 'm talking more about previous elections dems have won against deeply unpopular republicans whose incumbency is a disadvantage incumbency is an advantage in situation of slightly disliked to loved candidates not hated candidates also swing voters do n't have hard ideological preferences for the most part but are looking for answers to problems the country is facing and if they hate the incumbent enough will choose the alternative its not like you have 10 percent left wing 40 percent center left 40 percent center right and 10 percent hard right and these are hard line ideological preferences voters hold with the fervor of a lifelong party functionary election results instead reflect the ability of the two existing parties to monopolize the spaces of hard right and not the hard right they are not an eternal referendum on the unchanging beliefs of voters but the result of them choosing what they 're stuck with
at least my candidate did n't try to overturn the will of the primary voters at the convention and he tried to do it again in 2020 until obama pleaded with him to drop out and create a progressive temper tantrum that lasts until this day
what how did he try to do that he endorsed her and biden this is some serious revisionist history here again his voters happily voted for both dem candidates in each election when polls showed “ your candidates ” voters would not do the same she lost because she thought she had it in the bag and did n’t campaign in crucial states bernie nor his voters had anything to do with that i voted for both without issue yet you think it ’s our fault laughable honestly
is it the same opening the worm made in his brain
rfk can go fuck himself
yeah um rfk you have zero chance please tell me he does n't think he 's going to actually be president
having a debate by yourself is sad
he 's calling this sad did n't he host a debate by himself that s pretty sad
imagine if we had all three on stage biden could mutter incoherent nonsense trump could say that every city in the us is burning down kennedy could say that covid actually has a point and we should listen to it more
no thanks we do not need more of a shitshow
i long for the day i never have to hear about this anti vaxxer again
heroin addict failson with brainworms says what
the debate was sad but he does n’t have much room to talk go watch his “ debate ” it was n’t pretty either
can we just get a 50 year old governor with zero drama in as president i just want a decade or three of quiet boring competence just headlines after headlines on estate tax debates and omnibus bills is that so much to ask
in your dreams rfk jr
the worm can fuck off too
the fact he thought it was a good idea to talk about a worm eating his brain is very strong evidence that a worm ate his brain
so he ’s going to get 7 people to vote for him now instead of 3 that ’s his opening
sorry rfk voting for biden
i see him rising he ’s really articulate even with his voice
i agree with rfk joe was out of his mind
rfk is better than biden
if more people were active in politics and got more people to vote in local elections and overall be involved yeah that can happen people have to work for that to happen and not enough are
i just want pete buttigieg man
yeah i disagree with him on so many things but at least he can put a coherent thought together trump is trump and after that debate i do n’t think biden should have access to the nuclear codes
the voice plays even worse than the open mouth and wondering eyes the dnc messaging folks wo n’t have it a lot like how they put biden on the back burner in 2016 and torpedoed bernie twice
he has no experience and spouts dangerous anti science rhetoric that has literally killed dozens of children the only reason he 's given any attention at all is because of his last name biden is old i 'll take old over baby killer
yeah a 70 year old who has a brain worm much better
how is an anti vax conspiracy theorist with no political experience better than biden
i have nothing polite to say about people who kill children
his usdot performance has been lackluster
does n't matter trump 's going to be president
an untrained chimp with dyslexia is better than child sniffer biden
what are you 5 years old
and somehow trump manages to be even worse
did n't trump gloat about perving on pageants is a convicted felon for sleeping with a porn star and covering it up with money while his wife was in labour and liable for defaming a woman he sexually assaulted
hmm i see it 's amusing how you rfk supporters can say he 's better but when asked how you ca n't provide a substantive answer it 's like there 's nothing about rfk that makes him better
is that any way to speak about your future president
rfk has n't embezzled money from ukraine and his son is n't a pedo crackhead for starters
how is that article saying he killed children
i think you mean “ emperor ” he has been crystal clear about his authoritarian desires
do you think people on the left like cnn what does this comment mean
cnn is owned by a right wing organisation now it tries its best to be center now but sways everywhere i tune into all of them including fox periodically but get most news from reddit brightbart npr the hill loads of places but you seem to post actual memes exclusively against biden and complain that mods are mean to you but you imply i 'm biased lol read the room you might be the issue
oh i 'm sorry i should have been more clear i meant legitimate reasons not conspiracy nonsense
kennedy also played a part in one of the worst measles outbreaks in recent memory in 2018 two infants in american samoa died when nurses accidentally prepared the combined measles mumps and rubella or mmr vaccine with expired muscle relaxant rather than water the samoan government temporarily suspended the vaccination program and anti vaccine advocates including kennedy and his nonprofit flooded the area with misinformation the vaccination rate dropped to a dangerously low level the next year when a traveler brought measles to the islands the disease tore through the population sickening more than 5 700 people and killing 83 most of them young children
are you a time traveler from 2018 or something
what does that even mean you make about as much sense as joe biden did in last night 's debate
this fake sympathy is something else
we as voters and his supporters owe him the truth he is on track to destroy his legacy we owe it to him to make it loud and clear that he needs to step aside
the voters knew biden was old when they gave him 90 % of the primary vote
america owes corporate media the truth they want trump and the end of democracy
he ca n't come back from that it 's over he needs to step aside for the good of the country
time to take the car keys away from grandpa
he 's like captain ahab without the rizz
oh right the most successful legislative president in 50 years has a bad night due to having only one minute to respond to a fire house of unmoderated les and some dems are peeing their panties
his loved ones would rather cling onto power instead of having grandpa enjoy a nice retirement home
oh this perhaps the shittiest bait title i ’ve seen yet
that he did n't lose a single voter in light of the dementia addled psychopath and convicted felon to his right yeah i 'm pretty sure they told him
his wife should be called out her first duty should be to her husband looking out for her having his back and making sure he 's ok instead she would rather stay first lady and send her clearly declining husband to the wolves that 's some devious shit
do away with the sympathy then and just focus on the fact the whole country just saw an incumbent president that is not of sound mind he was feeble mumbling and vacant if he runs he will lose every swing state he is not a viable option i ’m an independent that leans progressive i also ca n’t stand trump but i ca n’t vote for biden after that he needs to go take a nap and f off
right this is dianne feinstein and rbg all over again
give it a rest biden is n't going anywhere dude has put in amazing policies while in office hahaha freaking reactionists
the de facto leader of the president 's party is the president no prospective candidate from the party of the president in their right mind would run against the incumbent it is career suicide
in his almost 4 years in office biden has only done 30 ish press conferences for comparison obame did nearly 3x as many in that same period of time even trump managed to eek out 88 in his time in office biden and his team have purposefully limited his unfiltered exposure to his constituents likely because of what we saw last night the american people deserve to be able to make informed decisions i say this as an extremely liberal person who voted for biden four years ago the debate should be shocking to anyone who cares about the future of this country democrat and republican alike
they did not know that he was losing his train of thought i do n't care that he has a stutter i think it 's impressive what he 's been able to overcome in his life i do n't care that he had a cold and had a quiet raspy voice last night i certainly care when he shows his mental faculties failing we did n't have debates no one important ran in the primaries because he 's the incumbent if he had a publicized disaster of this magnitude a year ago there absolutely would have been more competitive primaries
the only choices on there besides biden were who a and who b
this is the right response
weird to imply his family does n't love him also none of his family have positions in his administration so they do n't have power just adjacency to power which they would still have as family members of a former president and vice president
fake diagnoses are old hat at least
not even close plus if he were to die in office or be removed we would n't lose the wh and even the policies being perdued by this administration stop hyperventilating
how was feinstein ’s situation anywhere near as grievous as rbg she was absent for a few months on the judiciary committee but the pace of judges being confirmed did n’t slow and when she died she was replaced quickly
so you 'd prefer these policies to be wiped out in january
campaigning and governing are two wholly different things
ya defending the primary results is being dishonest no one worth a damn dared to run
but guys if he dies in office we still have the wh way to set the bar high
feinstein had been mentally checked out for years before her absence not as consequential as rbg but definitely an egregious case of decaying in your political office
what is it about the silent gen boomers where they fight tooth and nail to cling to power until they re reduced to drooling mush how is that acceptable to you do n't you think we deserve better to be represented by people who 's cognizance is n't in constant doubt
dems still have time to put up a progressive candidate who can continue or improve upon those policies and actually compete with trump if biden steps aside
biden is running to be president of the united states not the prime minister of britain the president serves as not just the head of government but the head of state they represent the nation yes you vote for policies when you vote for a president but you also vote for who will represent the country this part of the president 's duties are represented by a the sitting monarch in the british system but a core part of the job of president is being a cheer leader and representative of the nation so yes vibes do matter here yes biden can lay claim to having better policies but trump rightly or wrongly can make the case that i may be a a lying perverted asshole but i will fight tooth and nail for our country i 'll represent our national interests with passion and fire i 'll be a rabid bull dog fighting for our nation in peace and war against our national adversaries i do n't buy that shtick but it 's a case he can make and a lot of people do buy it biden in contrast seems like someone who will let our adversaries walk all over us yes you can complain that 's it 's irrational and we should only care about policy not vibes but vibes matter being able to move public opinion and employ the bully pulpit is often necessary to move policy forward and running for president you are also running for the role of chief national cheer leader in fact that 's ultimately the president 's core duty the president can push policy but ultimately they ca n't do anything without congress the president 's head of state functions however are something that is solely theirs and trump last night made the case that he can perform that head of state role a lot more effectively than biden can his whole pitch is i 'm a lying narcissistic pervert but i 'll be this nation 's lying narcissistic pervert
the fact you see it as a binary option is part of the problem biden does n't have to run he is not special and offers no unique advantages over virtually any other democratic candidate but many disadvantages
if i just downvote truths that are hard to hear it will all go away right
when was the last time a major political party replaced their candidate in the middle of campaign season and won the presidency incumbency is a huge advantage
if biden drops out it is a guaranteed loss to trump there is no doubt
not if the incumbent comes across as senile
when was the last time an octogenarian who could n't complete a thought was running to be the leader of the country
incumbency advantage is good for popular presidents biden is not a popular president even if i think he should be we do n't know what a candidate replacement would look like and how it would reflect in the polls even if you polled now you 'd suffer from lack of name recognition or familiarity that would be solved by november a lot of people have framed this election as why does it have to be those two this solves that problem for those people hypothetically it 's honestly impossible to predict imo as we simply do n't have data on that scenario for the presidency people will have different opinions the closest would be johnson dropping out in march 1968 but he also had similar low approval scores like biden other elections are less covered and far more localized and thus have different dynamics
that does n't answer my question one bit since you think it 's a viable strategy to replace the incumbent candidate you should be able to come up with an example when it 's happened before right
i do n't know why some people are in such disbelief the guy is 82 years old and is asking to be made president until he 's 86 there have been concerns about his age for a long time he said he was still healthy and able to do the job he tried to prove it to the world and it did n't seem to work why is that shocking there are of course people in their early to mid 80s that are super healthy and active who could handle the most stressful job on the planet but there are n't many and biden does n't seem to be one of them either it sucks it 's a sad thing to see but physically he just does n't seem up for another 4 and a half years of this i think he did a great job as president and i wish he could keep going but he seems like a spent force no changes in campaign strategy or ad blitzes are going to change that i still do n't buy that he has dementia or that mentally he too far declined to know what 's going on but physically he does not seem to be good shape and it 's only going to get worse many of us wo n't even live to 82 years old it should not be surprising that being president at that age is an extreme challenge and that 's why we have never even seen it before biden wanted to give it a go and it 's not panning out the spirit seems willing but the flesh is unable to carry this on much longer biden needs to do what is right for the country and our democracy and retire he 's a real fighter and has had a stellar career but the time has come for him to step aside and let someone else take over in this election saying an 82 year old man might be too old to handle all of this is not dooming or trolling it 's just a realistic take if biden stays in the race of course i 'll vote for him over trump for many reasons i genuinely hope it does n't come to that
trump was talking about ending palestine and deporting tens of millions of people but we 're all worried about biden
i 've heard quite enough of the telegraph 's hot takes for this election cycle thanks but no
trump behaved exactly in the mad lying manner we have come to expect but biden performed much worse than any of us were expecting trump did n't win the debate as much as biden lost it
the presidency or politics for that matter is n't only about youth you have to understand fundamentally many of the issues of importance to safeguard a nation and serve its people as equally as possible biden may be old but so is trump and most of the career congressmen in the senate and house of representatives it 's not american idol or a horse race no matter how much the corporate media wants to paint them that way biden has a long history of looking out for the average american that 's in my opinion a crucial characteristic in any candidate for public office
from the telegraph joe biden and donald trump went head to head for the first time in this us election campaign last night and it could not have been more catastrophic for the incumbent president and at one point a total freeze kamal and camilla break down the highlights and perhaps more accurately lowlights of a remarkable debate and talk to us editor tony diver who was in the spin room ’ in atlanta getting all the reaction from the republican and democrat camps plus telegraph political editor ben riley smith joins them in the studio to chat about his during which the prime minister accused reform leader nigel farage of being a putin appeaser they also reflect on after a reform uk canvasser used a racist term to describe him with the prime minster saying that farage has questions to answer ’ watch all episodes of the daily t or on or if you would prefer to listen to the audio only then use the player above you can also listen on or wherever you get your podcasts and subscribe to for updates
no one here thinks trump is a better option than biden we are worried about bidens ability to win the election
or that apparently he knew that it was putin 's dream to grab ukraine
yeah i 'm worried about biden losing the election which is going to happen at the state he 's in sure i 'll still vote for him but he 's still going to lose
without even being able to articulate exactly how he would follow through on his promises of mass deportation legit could not answer the question
is it really a hot take though the guy took a week debate prepping in a bunker and still managed to put out a product that resembles a flaming bag of shit
what are we talking about we are talking about a real time horror show last night that exposed our president as someone struggling to function but yeah act like it ’s no big deal and yes i am voting against trump too but i can still demand dems do the right thing and bring in new blood
they have a much lesser chance of winning if their nominee struggles to string a sentence together i will vote for whoever is running under the democratic party but i wish we had a better option
exactly i trust more than anything that the quality of the team pulled together by the biden admin will be leaps and bounds above any sycophants and unqualified yes men the trump admin conjures up that fact alone is enough to secure my vote
yeah last night was a disaster i think trump might have to win this one
i feel like i ’m living in a different reality than you last night only gave me the confidence that biden will lose in november
he had trouble formulating his sentences last night while trump clearly did not yes they are both old but trump is clearly more mentally fit than biden
in 1972 he was young guys i mean he may not be able to speak coherently and he looks like he died a week ago and was reanimated by cid ’s play things in toy story but one time he said prostitutes that means he is hip and cool send a trillion to ukraine who needs it put the nuclear football in front of him and ask if he wants to press a shiny button
i think folks here are so used to sounding opinions off like minded folks that we have built a delusion it may make them feel better now but the ending is the same we are in deep shit
i think trump is a better option
i guess the missed point is that what you demand is of no affect to me thus “ fuck what y’ all are talking about ” hope that helps
100 % not about to give up in this fight over one night fucking tired fighting alongside these weak ass people man lol anyway we ’re still winning
dems had no problem electing the corpse of dianne feinstein why not the president
ah yes the same team that 's been spouting on about how biden is a firecracker behind closed doors it 's a straight up scandal those idiots are handing trump the win by keeping biden in the race
and i feel like i ’m living in a different reality than you to each their own your takeaway from the debate is that he ’s losing mine is that he ’s still winning is what it is i guess
i think biden was like wtf is this guy saying but trump has had plenty of speeches where his mind just vanishes and returns only to start sucking his own pecker thankfully the presidency is not about who can blather the most it 's about who can tend to the pressing issues of the nation this is why biden 's got the upper hand
you guys are overexaggerating the shit out of this debate jesus christ biden clearly did n't do great but let 's not act like trump did n't say the craziest shit out of left field
biden 's policies are what matter to me and hopefully to most americans it would also be nice to have a president that does n't cave to kim jon un putin and xi on first sight
genuine question what makes you think so
so you support russia taking ukraine the us leaving nato abortion and possibly birth control bans overturning the aca and everything else trump wants to do and what if bird flu takes off and we have another pandemic you want trump and his imbecile appointees in charge again biden is too old and not an ideal candidate but at the end of the day he and the people he appoints can at least run the country competently
the dems will get destroyed in november if they keep biden on the ticket why do you think there was an intense panic in the democrat party right after the debate
i 'll take weekend at biden 's over incompetent rage any day i 'd rather see 4 years of stagnation than the backsliding pile of shit a second trump term would heap on this country
the overall consensus among democrats in the media is that biden needs to be replaced so the democrats can have a shot to win what did you see last night that is different
and let ’s not act like hundreds of millions of people did not see joe biden mumble incoherent sentences as a decrepit 95 year old looking zombie for 90 minutes he beat medicare though trump never could get that done
no caving for biden he should watch out for gentle breezes or a one finger small shove though looks like he could be taken out by them
i am not a trump supporter and i ’m certainly not a biden supporter after last nights debate one thing i hear a lot that sways me to trump is biden ’s economy is worse and biden ’s control over the border is worse i would not vote for trump because of jan 6 but i would n’t exactly vote for biden either because of the two above issues i mentioned i ’ll admit i ’m pretty uneducated on this stuff so if someone would debate me inform me that would be great
i really ca n’t stand these “ so you ”
we ’re winning in november dude lol
i know that 's what all these fucking headlines are telling you
i saw a candidate who articulated albeit slowly in tune with his speech impediment his policy defended his record made promises towards the future and attacked his opponent within the framework of the debate i saw another candidate struggle to directly answer questions in a clear coherent manner struggle to stay on topic interject with unrelated issues migrants get flustered as personal attacks unable to defend himself on anything like am i supposed to trust the media consensus over my own two eyes here maybe it ’s just differences in culture and experiences but while the msnbc panel was screaming fire i saw and engaged with others regarding things black jobs and that candidates general inability
i do n't think trump would withstand a push either trump is 78 years old the policies are not to better you with trump is the problem you are not a billionaire and you are not a member of his family you 're not even a millionaire you like millions of americans if you are an american are just couple of paychecks or a chronic illness diagnosis from falling into an economic hole from which you come out to live under some bridge in your city or drug addiction in short you do n't even register in trump 's radar but hey that 's you the rest of us we like to get something back out of the government we pay taxes to
you can have all the feelings you want the reply to you is accurate if you ’re voting for trump the post described what you ’re voting for
bury your head in the sand all you want and see how far that gets you in november your trauma response is showing
same thing you told yourself in 2016 right lol dude lol
i have eyes and ears dude same with everyone who saw last night i do n’t know why some like you are ignoring reality we need a younger candidate or else we will lose
because “ we finally beat medicare ” is coherent take your head out of the sand you desperately need some air
as opposed to biden where none of that is true if i am diagnosed with a chronic illness right now none of those things are issues lmao
trauma response lol fuck are you even trying to say here anyway we ’re winning in november
lol yeah i a college kid at the time had all the confidence in the world that hillary was winning in 2016 sure 2018 2020 2022 however
you toss out all the guaranteed republican and independent votes from reliable voting blocks for a hail mary play of switching out joe for someone younger as if any other democratic candidate has a chance in hell of maintaining the broad coalition of voters determined to keep trump out of the white house
i mean it ’s almost like my assessment is rooted in watching the entire 90 minutes rather than relying on quips in my defense but go off i guess
you ’re going to be so disappointed and whiny for 4 years why are you having trouble being honest with yourself
what guaranteed republican is going to vote for joe
not shocking to find that
we all have eyes and ears too i do n’t know how you can watch last night and not get this sinking pit in your stomach that joe is n’t what he used to be and we ’re in trouble i thought all democrats were n’t blind to reality you ’re proving me wrong
you sure i ’m going on about 6 years of winning so doubt it
the ones that fired his ass in 2020 after everything that has occurred since november 2020 there is no fucking way they just flip back to trump or are stupid enough not to vote based on this single debate throwing that all out window and relying on younger or more progressive americans to pick up all that slack and vote to get joe 's replacement across the finish line is extremely illogical
lmao oh nooo people do n’t agree with me anyway
oh no we ’re in trouble guess i better just count us out and not be motivated to fight anymore or i can reach conclusions based on what i observed and know stemming from my education and experiences the “ how ” in that ca n’t be hard to fathom but i guess man
hope is n’t lost we just need joe to step aside for a younger candidate to give us a shot to win if the dems continue to run joe we will all lose
i remember reading the nyt all the time as a kid either it 's changed a lot or i have
not likely whoever wrote this article needs to have their internet permissions revoked
there 's no way running her would be worse than sticking with biden
harris could not win this election nobody likes her i mean she could do the job probably pretty well but getting there is just a non starter
extremely stupid if you 're going to replace him replace him with someone charismatic newsom whitmer
did she ever break 1 % when she was trying to run before
no she ca n't she has left the negative narratives about her unchallenged for too long middle america 's opinion on her is set now
kamala harris is why i do n’t worry about biden not finishing his term we ’re good either way
i do n't think harris can win she is the same candidate at al gore john kerry and hillary clinton they were all very knowledgeable about the government would likely make a good president and they have no personality they all talk at people not too them whether we like it or not obama trump and to a less degree bill clinton made a large part of the presidential race a personality contest biden is the same as the others but since the voters had all had 4 years of trump they were willing to vote him in
bad on purpose to make you click kind of headline
umm no she polls worse than biden
no she ca n’t maybe if trump and biden both die before november
kamala is probably one of the few democrats that would do worse than biden so no thank you nyt shut up and go back to spouting ignorance about the russia ukraine war i ’m used to tuning you out on that topic already
a senile old man or the most unpopular vp since they started performing the poll oof
kamala harris can not win the election she 's already deeply criticized as a vice president for her lack of broader involvement in the biden presidency fact is the only reason you even see news about her is because we are in the fairly unique scenario of a 50 50 senate deadlock where the vp has to exercise their tie breaking powers frequently this almost never happens in fact despite her crucial role in breaking the senate deadlock when is the last time you 've actually heard about something she has done while in the office of the vp like biden was effectively obama 's chief foreign policy advisor during his time as his vp and so was dick cheney for bush much to america 's detriment though even fucking mike pence was running the reestablished national space council during the trump presidency harris though fuck all she 's basically been reduced to her senate tie break vote and being a frontwoman for biden at political events like seriously you 'll actually has a pretty hard time finding anything outside her senate activities identifying anything she 's actually been contributing in the dynamic
is this satire or pure copium
weird take i honestly ca n’t think of a more invisible vice president in my lifetime
jesus christ fucking no why do n’t we bring back hilary clinton while we ’re at it this is why we keep losing elections
trump plant who wants trump to win would suggest that harris should take over nobody is falling for it
please for the love of god nooo
i think the dems can win this trump is not necessarily a hard opponent but you need to pick someone young and not as divisive not sure who that is but it is n't over unless you stick with biden
empty the coffers and get jon stewart
harris would get absolutely smoked nobody likes her michelle obama is the only option with a realistic chance and she apparently has no interest
no however if biden is going to be stubborn and not step down for someone like whitmer or newsom he has to give her some airtime lots of it people need to remember that there is someone competent at the helm of something we 're to happen to biden people just kind of forget about the line of succession when they get wrapped up in the candidate 's age that 's what the vp is for
exactly 4 years ago many people had the idea that biden would be a symbol and kamala would be the power behind the scenes and in 2024 be elected as the first female president instead she got put in an ice box one day after the election and kept there for 4 years by a senior citizen she 's not winning anything ever again in her life
stop i want my neighbor or your neighbor not anymore rich and powerful who are “ in line to the throne ”
this headline and others like it reveal where the real political desperation resides in the republican party
she would get absolutely obliterated we have a serious problem can we please have serious solutions
no one likes biden we like kamala harris even less
jesus stop kamala is n’t winning anything a black woman in the us is n’t winning the white house in 2024 folks who say michelle obama or kamala truly have no concept of the systemic racism and bigotry that exists here stop
yup nobody else in the party has her name recognition she 's the only real choice if biden steps aside
i would never vote for her
harris is as popular with the american public as chlamydia this is such a tone deaf editorial
no she fucking ca n't she would lose to any republican in 2024 or 2028 america will never elect a half black half indian woman
she has a better chance than the zombie that was on stage yesterday but literally any centrist democrat would be better
kamala is busy everyone letting the base know that the lgbtq and abortion right that the dems let be taken away they 're gon na fight to get them back vp harris should have showed up in orlando condemning the corruption of our political system at the alec meeting last july this is where project 2025 was finally put in motion plans discussed money and legislation exchanged and the muster for war against america but no they are not fighting the enemy and until the link is made from the money corruption and our oppression nothing will change now the best to hope for is another squeaker of a win for dems and let the supreme court and republicans keep destroying our democracy until pugs win
i do think she 'd dismantle trump on a debate stage but i do n't think she gets to 270 fair or unfair she 's even less popular than biden was before yesterday
she ’s just as unlikable as joe
nope as a da she put a whole lot of people in jail for cannabis fuck her
asking biden to step down at this point is unrealistic and kind of dumb
jesus christ the amount of pearl clutching over 1 debate
this is why there is no plan b everybody has a candidate they are pushing we are talking about a democrat civil war 3 months before the election
she will not the dems are lost if they push another candidate at this point it will be seen as undemocratic and rightfully so they missed their window primaries have gone and passed the dnc is hitched to biden they have to live with their choice it honestly feels like they are trying to lose at this point
harris ' brief presidential campaign proved she 's unelectable wes moore and whitmer are the only democratic politicians who would have a decent chance but i 'm not sure either would risk it since they 're in a good position to run in 2028
huh the nyt who has had an unprofessional axe to grind with biden for not giving the owner of the nyt a personal interview is a leading voice calling for him to step down shocked i tell you shocked
doubtful sadly heartbreaking the people in america simply are not smart enough 2016 proved too many women do n’t like smart successful women putinjrtrump republican cult women do what ever their male advisors tell them men in america are n’t ready maybe never all around the world israel mexico india britain new zealand but 2016 proved too many primitive people still around in usa
the situation is bad but it 's not let 's have harris run for president bad
a little of column a but mostly column b i assure you nyt has always parroted the desires of the capitalist class to one degree or another
the nyt benefits from chaos and turmoil and what ’s more chaotic than a second trump presidency
these are the reasons nyt running through ground
more to the point switching to anyone will yield worse results than biden some would have advantages even beyond just age but they 'd also have disadvantages more importantly the timing makes it tantamount to political suicide in that race will harris replace him that 's likely going to lead to a weaker showing than biden someone else who has the national recognition and appeal to run in his place with four months to gain recognition and to articulate a coherent policy platform the republicans and their news outlets will never stop crowing about how they were right and biden was unfit so the democrats are forced to pick and unknown at the last minute a comparative unknown with no mandate from the primaries and could democrats unite behind a single replacement before the convention a closely contested convention would hurt their public perception even further
running a senile old man clearly not fit to serve another 4 years is worse than running kamala jesus dems have their priorities all fucked up
she ’s impressively unlikable even people that completely align with her politically just do n’t like her and every time i hear that fake laugh of hers i fully understand why lol
how does the idea of a dying man running the country not worry you
that is on purpose she is highly unliked and does not help biden with anyone not already on his side
aside from not being qualified why would he do that
whitmer or newsom are the obvious choices
even without the systemic racism she ’s not a strong candidate
i do n't particularly like harris but never 's an awfully big word i 'd vote for her if she ran against someone awful like a felon or a sexual predator
did you watch the debate some things are pretty hard to come back from
hyperbole much dnc getting their feathers ruffled is no skin off my back
every single person who voted for the biden harris ticket did so with the knowledge that kamala harris was there to step in and be the backup president if necessary this would quite literally be the vp doing her job that she was voted into office to do
i 'm not convinced a potential candidate to replace biden actually needs any national recognition some random somewhat reasonable and competent person nobody had ever heard of could probably beat trump just on the fact that they 're not trump not being in the withering public eye this last decade might even help them
will harris replace him that 's likely going to lead to a weaker showing than biden why biden was incoherent and lost last night someone else who has the national recognition and appeal to run in his place harris yes she 's a milquetoast uninspiring neoliberal so is biden with four months to gain recognition and to articulate a coherent policy platform she 's biden 's vp she can just adopt biden 's platform whole cloth and she can articulate it better than biden can at this point the republicans and their news outlets will never stop crowing about how they were right and biden was unfit so the democrats are forced to pick and unknown at the last minute harris is n't unknown hell if biden falls down the stairs tomorrow she 'll be president a comparative unknown with no mandate from the primaries she has at least some mandate as she 's been part of biden 's ticket through the whole primary campaign and could democrats unite behind a single replacement before the convention a closely contested convention would hurt their public perception even further who easier to rally behind than the number two
all legit points however young men are more conservative than other generations young people in general mad about israel palestine and concerns about cognition is an almost guarantee trump is elected the biggest variable to me is the anger over the war and someone else can distance themselves from the policy while pointing out trumps stance was “ israel should finish what they started ” realistically i would buckle up for four more years of trump
who has the national recognition and appeal to run in his place i can not imagine this matters at all within a week of becoming nominee they will be nationally known as the candidate against trump with four months to gain recognition and to articulate a coherent policy platform i do n't think a coherent policy platform is important in the modern age anyone elected by biden 's delegates who are the ones who would do the voting would be mostly aligned with most current policy positions platforms are hardly even brought up in this campaign on either side and when they are the media ignores them anyways the republicans and their news outlets will never stop crowing about how they were right and biden was unfit so the democrats are forced to pick and unknown at the last minute you 're right and they wo n't stop if biden stays the nominee either a comparative unknown with no mandate from the primaries i agree the nominee would have no mandate from the primaries but acting like biden even participated in the primary and does have a mandate from the primaries ignores the reality that he is an incumbent president thus no one important ran and there were no debates anyways he was literally the only realistic option we were given and could democrats unite behind a single replacement before the convention a closely contested convention would hurt their public perception even further it 's certainly a risk but what 's the alternative to taking that risk guaranteed loss with biden i do n't see how we have any other option trump may not debate him again and planned speeches are n't going to convince that what people saw at the debates was n't real
i disagree i think newsom would do really well
i legitimately think kamala would do worse against trump which is crazy lol
kamala had no support during the primary for a reason
easy a convicted felon is a non starter for me
jon would never i have no idea why people constantly throw his name out
i saw two old men one was off his game and likely sick the other was a fucking crazy liar
especially if you do n’t even give the person a chance
the dnc is a faction in the democratic party maybe you meant the convention if one side votes bernie the other romney and the other kamala and the other newsome that is guaranteeing 4 years of trump cause there is no unifying primary result and project 2025
no doubt in my mind she would poll worse than even biden at this point time will tell
we knew it but many were not thrilled with it
i voted for biden despite harris i will not vote for harris under any circumstance i 'm not alone
could probably beat trump just on the fact that they 're not trump but we 've seen time and again that trump garners significant support despite being trump you 're describing the attitude of the clinton campaign but something about his voters made scandal after scandal and failing after failing not stick on him in their minds and that 's even truer today
why biden was incoherent and lost last night i do n't see how he lost a debate outweighs picking someone with no time to establish themselves bolstering right wing talking points about biden 's lack of fitness choosing someone with no mandate from the primaries which will in turn risk a split convention etc etc etc harris when biden 's approval ratings were at their lowest harris ' were still lower she has some problems from the left on her record as california 's ag but biggest is her invisibility even by recent vp standards her recent blitz of publicizing sexual violence by hamas against israelis will hurt more than help as many voters including some who point out that decades of sexual violence against palestinians by israelis has gone unremarked will see it as compounding the administrations mistake of uninterrupted supply of offensive weapons to israel i honestly think newsom or whitmer would be modestly better positioned though not by enough harris is n't unknown people know her name and position but unsurprisingly given her lack of visibility most know little or nothing more she would be the obvious choice to unify democratic support but even if she fared better than newsom or whitmer would which i doubt it still would n't be enough for a seriously competitive election given the fallout and other disadvantages biden departing would cause
the debate made it more likely but not yet inevitable i think biden stepping aside would make it inevitable we 've seen some movement of young women diverging from young men overall in political leaning 65d 30r versus 62d 36r for men as of less than a year ago one would hope and expect that that movement would be a little more pronounced in more moderate swing states but i ca n't provide evidence for that
within a week of becoming nominee they will be nationally known as the candidate against trump being a household name counts clinton 's campaign continually tried to limit sanders ' visibility even at the cost of limiting her own because she was the household name it 's particularly important with undecided voters who are more likely to be low information voters platforms are hardly even brought up in this campaign immigration israel palestine abortion rights these are front and center in political speeches and news many important policy positions are underdiscussed both by candidates and the media but not all you 're right and they wo n't stop if biden stays the nominee either but they could offer the proof of him stepping aside after proving his senility as they would frame it he was literally the only realistic option we were given that does n't change the fact that no replacement proved their level of popular support like they would have had to in a competitive primary it also has implications for where support would fall at the convention guaranteed loss with biden biden 's debate performance made defeat more likely but not inevitable all the myriad downsides of him stepping aside would make it all but inevitable we have n't even seen the results of polls post debate yet i do n't see how we have any other option the option trumpeted by center and center left media is the road to almost certain defeat
he would be pretty crappy he has n’t done much to improve any major issue in ca but he has burned through all of our money and allows pg e to price gauge most of the state
he 's as good a choice as any and i would definitely have said he had a better chance if biden never ran probably even if biden withdrew shortly before the first primaries now that means a lot stacked against him that have nothing to do with him but regarding him 1 despite being a moderate many swing state voters will view him as ultra liberal because of right slanted media coverage and things like lockdowns immigration policy and gun laws fair or not that 's not the public image that 's going to win undecided swing state voters 2 california has not fared great under him largely due to forces beyond his control but in some cases having to do with insufficient or ineffective responses homelessness economic dislocation and property crime rates are among the most visible the last is partly misperception and partly covid based anomalies but that 'll be the public perception but the problems of public perception that democrats are scrambling to fix the mistake of effectively nominating biden however they can only 4 months to campaign and build recognition and express a platform and the high likelihood of a contested convention all make any replacement infeasible at this point
shit i think hrc would do better kamala 's got to be the only democrat less popular than biden
that does n’t answer the question at all we both agree trump is really bad i ’ll never vote for him you do n’t have to pretend that you feel totally ok about a president dying in office how is that last year going to look in terms of his ability to run a country
why they are functionally identical generic middle of the road dems except harris has the benefit of being able to use complete sentences on tv
money and time a new candidate would have neither and that would be a huge assumption that the party could unite around one person it 's a fairy tale of an idea that does n't take into consideration of how big of a machine a campaign actually is i commented about this earlier but based on my experience i 'm not aware of a mechanism to transfer a war chest to another candidate outright people donated to biden harris not harris whitmer or whatever it 's an insane idea that you can just swap someone in like an injured defensive lineman
name recognition matters more in primaries because you are not guaranteed a spotlight as you said it is important with low information voters there is no such thing as a national candidate not getting the spotlight i 'm not saying there are n't issues being discussed i 'm saying the narrative that is being built is n't focused on the issues thus the campaigns are n't about the issues it should be in an ideal world but it 's not but they could offer the proof of him stepping aside after proving his senility as they would frame it i just do n't see why this matters the democrats look foolish to continue on with biden just as much as they do by dropping him the myriads of downsides you mention is certainly an opinion the whole public perception from moderates those who actually decide the elections has been anything but these two a new candidate would solve that problem for tons of people blank slate candidates have been used before they are particularly effective when the other side is a dumpster fire like trump it is nothing but theory that an unpopular incumbent stepping down before the convention would result in a worse outcome we do n't have historical examples of this in a general presidential election there are many positives of finding a new candidate at this time and people are acting like they do n't exist
they 'll just show the pictures of downtown sf before and after xi visited and bash him for being pro china and on how bad the homeless situation is the ads against him write themselves could do another one on the whole french laundry thing
i guess i do n’t share your ability to predict people ’s death dates
biden is more than just one debate people have good days and off days most presidents do poorly their first debate biden has been good as president trump 's been nothing but a disaster
i do n't vote for cops for any office ever even county sheriff she 's also fake she does n't have any positions of her own just what she thinks will get her elected she 's slimy condescending and a zionist
transfer a war chest to another candidate outright yeah i doubt they could transfer it to the dnc who could then use it without coordinating with the candidate 's campaign it 's an intensely complex set of interlocking laws which is why i did n't bring it up there 's a possibility they could but it would n't likely follow the intent of the laws governing it and there 's the real possibility they could n't
the democrats look foolish to continue on with biden just as much as they do by dropping him then should n't they take the option without all the negatives beyond looking foolish blank slate candidates have been used before they are particularly effective when the other side is a dumpster fire like trump afaik never anything like this late or at all in a modern presidential race and the thing about trump supporters and those considering voting for him they still support and consider voting for him he ca n't be any bigger a dumpster fire than he is now thanks in part to the judicial branch and they 'll still line up to vote for him i don not see any net positive emerging aside from if whitmer was chosen i doubt any replacement would win any of the 6 closes swing states
also burning through our huge surplus in our budget to now having us in a huge deficit and i personally think the pg e of it all should sink him
you ’re the one who brought up biden not finishing the term and you ’re not worried because of kamala
i do n’t think extreme oldness is an off day and he ’s getting older so it ’s rational to say “ he was n’t too old but now he is too old ” that ’s how age works
the president is the head of the branch of government charged with enforcing the law it is by definition every single president 's job to be a cop
when i was involved in politics when a candidate lost whatever was left in the various candidate funds primary runoff and general are all separate either had to be refunded somehow but most of the time it was converted to an advocacy project with permission from donors even if you could send it out to another pac there ca n't be coordination with the campaign it supports that 's a time consuming big pain in the ass with 1 m with 100 m ha biden harris converts funds into a pac harris xxx has literally no money and no time for fundraising the new harris campaign and the pac are legally barred from discussing messaging strategy or what to do with that money ca n't put harris to camera with that money i 'll note that i 've worked on ads for any level of office other than presidential does n't pay enough compared to the others but the rules should be the same as everything should fall the the same fec and irs rules the point of all that is the idea is logistically ridiculous and completely impractical to entertain this was the hand we were dealt and it turns out biden came out swinging today
nope everybody has off days regardless of one 's age
cool that does n't mean that an actual cop should be allowed allowed anywhere near that office sorry sweetie i 'm a progressive i ai n't voting for a zionist cop you tell the dnc to put up a candidate that is worthy of my vote and i 'll vote for them
there ca n't be coordination with the campaign it supports knew that part though it 's seemingly kind of a paper rule not the rest though thanks
i want trump to lose more than anything i really do n’t think gaslighting people is helpful i ’d much rather you say that he ’s way too old and not a good choice but still better than trump you ’re obviously entitled to your opinion though
it 's one of those things that if you are anyone other than trump you would n't risk it everything has a paper trail if i was working on a pac ad an employee was working on a campaign ad we 'd work on opposite sides of the office different server project tracking software vimeo etc just in case basically do n't get sued or create a news story like accidentally putting russian military footage in an ad lol not me
this is n't gaslighting it 's just being realistic i 'm not here praising anyone 's performance in that debate because no one did great
you would need to have brain worms to think that rfk jr is an acceptable alternative to biden if you consider yourself a left leaning person
more interesting why these headlines makes me not to trust your media
limited rank choice voting would provide us better leadership options limited to 12 parties
it ’s shocking how the 3 most prominent choices for the president are a decaying grandpa way past his retirement and bedtime a demented grandpa who should be in a jail cell and a grandpa with brain worms none of these guys should be allowed to walk in the streets by themselves let alone be or run for president
why is the media wasting time on this crack head my dog would be a better candidate she 's loyal has her shots and does n't have a worm in her brain
if only people knew he was n’t on the ballot in enough states to get 270 electoral votes
i think you 're underestimating how contagious brain worms are these days
i think it 's morally irresponisble to vote for trump or biden i do n't know who else to vote for but i can not vote for them
you ’d need brain worms to vote for the two who have nothing to say for themselves or what they could do for the country besides shitting on the other candidate fuck the lesser of two evils rfk is just whatever but he ’s not bad
lool biden defenders are so pathetic
there 's literally hundreds of alternatives any democrat in congress or a governors mansion wins this election if you 're saying let 's weekend at bernies biden nearly two months before the convention you do n't actually want trump to win
no that is a tribalist low iq voter point of view we need leadership and strength weekend at biden ’s is not our guy rfk is a sensible option and aligns with 90 % of center left views do n’t like his stance on vaxxx transparency who gives a shit take your jab
rfk is a life long democrat though the party and the ministry of truth slandered him until he had no choice but to do what he did as independent
because they 're hoping jr takes more votes from biden than trump
and your dog is probably more coherent than biden
i genuinely think you have to be stupid to think he ’d be worse behind the wheel of our country than trump or biden fuck another 4 years of the left and right hating each other more and more can we just find common fucking ground and get someone in office who will actually progress our society look at the other two options look at rfk and tell me the choice is n’t obvious
not to mention he ’s awful
can you show me where he is not eligible for 270 last i saw he was eligible for 348 and even turned in twice the amount of signatures required in most states including texas
he 's on the ballot in my state and after last night he has my vote unless the dems do n't swap out jb
at the end of the day we are voting for a party not a person if you want progressive legislation passed and upheld then voting for a party who will enact progressive legislation and appoint progressive judges is the best use of your vote same reasoning if you are conservative voting 3rd party in defiance or abstaining will do nothing to change the future candidates that get tossed out this much was made clear in 2016 and 2000 voting also creates a database record of the fact that you as a demographic want your voice to be heard if a party knows that they have a vast amount of votes from people ages 20 30 they will care about those people ’s opinions if 30 % of people 20 30 vote and 70 % of people 60 70 vote it is obvious that parties will care more about the voices of the older voters than the younger voters voting 3rd party or abstaining is essentially the same morally as doing nothing when presented with the trolley problem it is a morally wrong choice to do nothing and watch 5 people die it is also a morally wrong choice to make a decision and be responsible for 1 person dying no matter what you are morally wrong and can not take the high road all we can really do is fight for the best possible outcome we believe in within the given parameters of a choice
those are the only 2 viable options
rfk is the eviler of two evils
so was trump til he was n't that 's a useless statement
but have you actually researched rfk jr i did because i ’m also disappointed with biden his track record of promoting bogus health related conspiracy theories over the years was a major red flag your vote is your vote but after reading up on him it was biden all the way for me i do hate all of this though in the last few elections i ’ve just felt like i ’m voting for the lesser evil
he absolutely would be worse than biden
rfk is claiming he 's on the ballot in a ton of states that he has not even applied to reporters have polled state election officials as recent as last week and he had applied to enough states to reach 240 rfk is also including nevada even though nevada has specifically rejected his application
i 'm voting for the anti science conspiracy theorist because the other guy is old
if you think trump and biden are equally terrible then voting for a 3rd party is n't a waste at all
insulting people with differing opinions great we need more of that
elaborate what has biden done in his four years that we should re elect him literally nothing trump vs biden is just “ does n’t matter who our guy is as long as theirs does n’t win ” and it ’s fucking stupid and self destructive rfk is a happy medium i do n’t agree with him on a lot but that ’s okay he ’s not going to serve just to divide our population further in the next 4 years he is n’t a great candidate but he ’s an okay one and the other two are fucking horrible why pick one horrible candidate just so that the other horrible one does n’t win rfk has promise biden and trump have none
for me it ’s less about rfk himself and more about opening up independent candidates as an actual option so we ’re less fucked in determining our future and being forced to pick two awful choices that provide nothing i do n’t think rfk is a great candidate but i do think he ’s good enough to bring progress
what conspiracy theory that his dad was killed by the cia have you been awake the last few decades the cia is in the killing business
yup want my vote get someone younger random strangers on the internet trying to argue cajole and insult wo n't convince me to vote for the shit show i saw last night
8 years later and nothing has changed
biden has been an objectively good president
that is totally fair i ’ve been fed up with our two party system for years but as a gay woman i ’ve never been more terrified of an ultra conservative majority which has me continually voting democrat down the board i would genuinely love to see a third party candidate come along that i feel i can actually get behind but who also has a decent shot at winning this election for me personally feels too scary to vote third party in protest as much as i ’d like to stick it to both parties
no he has frequently parroted health related conspiracy theories over the years that were thoroughly debunked he is also an antivaxxer who believes the covid vaccine causes autism i would suggest doing some research on him first i was actually looking into him in the beginning because i thought his father and uncle were great his own family does n’t even support him in this election which is telling on its own
lmao better not hear any complaints about trump then
good for you nobody should vote for the husk of joe biden in november
pathetic trying to get under the skin of some online stranger get a grip and reflect on that for awhile
is there anything in that article regarding paying for a potential genocide or is that an objectively good thing too
“ objectively good president ” just threw any validation you thought you had out the window i ’m obviously a leftist but i ’m not stupid enough to think the biden administration is anything but a joke if this administration is what you think is a “ good ” example for how our nation should be ran you have disgustingly low standards for the most advanced nation on earth to further my point you can look at data all you want and think what you want of it but go outside talk to people look around you and see how desperate this nation is for change are we really doomed to a future of choosing two equally shitty candidates every four years that promise nothing besides the absence of the other or can we open the people up to choosing an option that works for everyone and can attend to the concerns of all party ’s and set the precedent for the future of voting for progress rather than to slow decay
his own family is bought and paid for by the democrat party and he has not said that covid vaccines cause autism your thinking about the other dozens of vaccines that use mercury as the adjuvant he ’s not even antivaxx or anti science bud advocates doe vaccine safety testing which was not done with covid vaccines do your own research and wake up to the lies that you ’ve been told your entire life
some of his family are literally biden employees some of his family is working in his campaign and fully support him his stance one issue is different than yours so you write him off completely he does not believe the covid vaccine causes autism however he was on jon stewart ’s the daily show in the early 2000s talking about the link between a vaccine chemical thimerosal and autism which is not in the covid vaccine
i will definitely complain about him and the brain dead biden stans that ignored me telling them what it would take to get my vote you have a bad candidate and time to get a new one so what 's more important to you biden winning or trump losing
it 's strange that you feel like i 'm trying to get under your skin
biden is more pro palestine than both trump and rfk which is not a high bar to reach but if that is a metric you care about then biden is who you should vote for
you can look at data all you want and think what you want of it but go outside talk to people look around you obviously their feelings are more important than facts
he has literally been parroting a connection between covid vaccinations and autism for a while now and has been called out on it but okay i was n’t even trying to be rude in my response to you i was simply offering a different point of view since my research on him was disappointing have a great day
i honestly was n’t trying to ruffle feathers here i just saw the comment above ask which conspiracy theory and was clarifying it was n’t about the cia killing his father and uncle it was about the health related ones he has been touting i did do research on him because i was genuinely interested in him at first you all can vote for whoever you want as is your right take care
the only way to guarantee a trump win is to switch candidates right now
because you 're attempting to insult but ok we have nothing to talk about it at this point have a good day
sounds like pro bloodshed to me
i ’m not talking about the other candidates does paying for a potential genocide make someone an objectively good president
numbers are n’t people that s my point and anyone should be able to understand that
ok to clarify the covid vaccines are not linked to autism but it ’s still too early to tell there is correlation between the vaccines promoted in the 1980s and the following boom in autism something like 1 25 males born today has autism with regards to the covid vaccines they were authorized for emergency use due to the panic we all endured in 2020 but the vaccines were not thoroughly tested for long term safety if you took your shot thanks for being part of the test group and i hope you do n’t experience any long term side effects i ’ll remain in the control group still covid free without any rogue spike proteins
i disagree and you have no proof we 'll find out who is right in november i guess but do n't forget it 's your fault if trump wins
objectively good does not mean perfect
the people have been lied to and their opinions do n't match reality 80 % of americans feel their personal finances are good or better yet only 38 percent of americans think the economy is good those numbers do n't jive and the reason is that people keep being told how terrible the economy is by the media so they believe it despite both the numbers and their own personal finances disagreeing
when influenza was killing hundreds of thousands of people and a vaccine was created for that i ’m sure it was even less thoroughly tested than the covid vaccine due to lack of technology and overall medical knowledge that we have now the difference was the influenza vaccine was n’t immediately politicized it was simply a health crisis that needed to be addressed covid is essentially the same thing the vaccine helps prevent the more serious reactions if you get the virus does it work for everyone of course not but not everyone can handle flu shots either i do appreciate your clarification here though and as i said in another comment i was n’t trying to ruffle feathers with my response you had asked what conspiracy was being referred to and i jumped into clarify when i probably should have just kept my mouth shut and continued to scroll like i usually do in political posts
bro is funding a genocide that is not objectively good lmaoooo
saying the economy is good is a privileged take you must have a solid amount of assets or cash to absorb the inflation
gimme me fucking break i would vote for his brain worms before him
this dude is such a joke
i 'm not voting for an anti vaxxer conspiracy theorist who has never held public office before we saw how badly that went in 2016 if he wants to get into politics he should try for something like city council first
oh please he 's been talking crazy shit for years
nobody cares about this lunatic today we have bigger things to deal with
dumbass probably debated himself and lost
at this point it 's either trump rfk or whomever replaces biden and i 'm not voting trump so rfk it is
take 3 minutes and watch this “ there was a poll taken that asked young people under 35 in this country are you proud of the united states 85 % said yes the same poll taken five months ago 18 % said yes so somehow during the administration of these two presidents an entire generation of americans has lost pride in our country hope in their own futures they feel that way because they see what 's happening they ca n't get into a home first generation in history in america that is gon na live worse lives than their parents they see the vitriol that you saw here the division the polarization that makes them disgusted with politics they 're seeing the corrupt merger of state and corporate power that has transformed our agencies from the cia the health agencies the environmental agencies into sock puppets the industries they 're supposed to regulate they 're seeing the destruction of our soils the destruction of our air and water they 're watching this happen and the politicians do nothing about it except for hate on each other if you want more of the same you should vote for president biden president trump you know what 's gon na happen they 're gon na give you four more years of the same stuff if you want things to completely change you 're gon na support me because i 'm gon na change everything this is a moral fight this is a moral battle for the soul of our nation to restore our moral authority around the world by projecting economic power broad rather than spending 8 trillion on regime change wars that have left every nation we 've touched worse off than we found it and restoring our moral authority here at home the first day in office you heard what they 're gon na do here 's what i 'm gon na do day one in office i 'm gon na issue an executive order saying any federal official who tells a lie to the american public will lose his job i 'm gon na stop the surveillance state i 'm gon na stop the propagandizing by our agencies of the american public i 'm gon na unravel the war machine i 'm gon na unravel the corrupt merger of state and corporate power i know how to do it i 've been litigating against these agencies for years and i 'm uniquely suited to do this i can tell you i 'm gon na do these things when i get in there i 'm gon na make sure that our constitution is protected and ai is deployed to make government more transparent rather than by government to enslave the rest of us i 'm gon na bring ai home and blockchain home because we need these new industries to grow our way out of the debt crisis this is something that these two are n't even talking about but if you want everything to change you 'll support me if you wanna vote out of fear you need to support one of those guys if you wanna vote out of hope out of inspiration out of pride in your country out of restoring the moral backbone of our people and our nation you should vote for me thank you very much ”
honestly i went in last night as a likely biden voter and a never trump voter but after last nights debate rfk is now annoyingly the only legitimate candidate if it ultimately ends up trump and biden then i have to vote for the most responsible option
i 'd say he could be a solution to the bigger things you have to deal with consider watching the 3 minute video and deciding for yourself
you did n't even watch the debate did you he responded to the same questions trump and biden got and actually answered them
consider this as me shaking your hand and giving you the jeremiah johnson head nod
if you wanna vote out of fear you need to support one of those guys that ’s rich coming from a conspiracy theorist who is afraid of science
take 3 minutes and watch this no
his association with roger stone completely voids anything he has to say
i find it to incredibly frustrating that so many people refuse to hear anything that rfk has to say simply because they disagree with him on the vaccine issue at the end of the day that is a small belief of his that is constantly blown far out of proportion if more people would just listen to what he is running on and what he wishes to do with the country and the budget i think he would have a legitimate shot at winning
even if you ’re being serious rfk is n’t on enough ballots to become president even if he wins every state he ’s on he s not a legitimate candidate
i do n’t think you listened to rfk jr he is a bad snake oil salesman with a bad voice
my comment with the transcript of his closing statement was downvoted despite it being the most positive about america amongst the three candidates in case you did n't see the links in that comment here they are again
i understand it can be hard to find three minutes in our busy days so when you do the link will still be there
the kennedy shanahan campaign has collected enough signatures at this moment for 348 electoral votes across the nation some states have not yet certified the petitions and a couple state 's petition windows have not yet opened
no i hear you but i just ca n't vote for biden now i feel if i do i 'm contributing to the abuse of an elderly person i 'm not being to accomplice to a crime to stop a felon from winning
rfk is a bad candidate trump is a danger to the constitution biden appears too old for four more months much less four more years if i absolutely had to decide right now i guess i 'd have to consider rfk i 'd still pull the level for the d i think but biden is simply not in a condition to have this job for another term or effectively execute the remainder of the campaign
no i listened i think he 's fucking insane a republican in disguise but he 's not a convicted felon or senile elderly person i 'm not saying he 's a great option i 'm not even saying that i want to vote for him but that on paper he is actually the only major candidate that is legitimate
and i still wo n't watch it
so just to be clear when you decide who to vote for you do not think about policies at all because in the general election that 's all i think about i fought hard against biden in the 2020 primary but general election decisions are really easy i want women to have rights over their bodies i want to support ukraine i want to mitigate climate change i want a chance to claw back some power from the supreme court it is such an easy decision to vote for democrats in the general but none of those actual policies matter to you just that biden is a shitty old man
what a stupid fucking mindset
so just to be clear when you decide who to vote for you do not think about policies at all i did n't say this it is such an easy decision to vote for democrats in the general is it right now they 're looking like the messy party in the middle of a leadership crisis with no clear direction biden literally agreed last night in the debate that migrants are pouring over the border killing people describing wanting to beat medicare but none of those actual policies matter to you just that biden is a shitty old man did you not watch the debate last night all of your talking points are outdated biden 's not just ' a shitty old man anymore it 's beyond that i listened to his actual policy positions and they were conservative slightly less right wing than trump 's who he agreed with several time during the debate i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that his current mental condition could be driving his apparent sudden shift towards conservative politics but meanwhile according to you we 're not supposed to listen to his policies not supposed to be concerned for his wellbeing we 're just supposed to close our eyes and trust me bro
coming from you that means nothing
so just to be clear when you decide who to vote for you do not think about policies at all i did n't say this you did you just do n't understand that you did and this comment you just posted is you saying it again but even worse in its own ways
dude i did n't care about your first insult so i certainly do n't care about this one
foxnews questionable source a questionable source exhibits one or more of the following extreme bias consistent promotion of propaganda conspiracies poor or no sourcing to credible information a complete lack of transparency and or is fake news fake news is the deliberate attempt to publish hoaxes and or disinformation for profit or influence sources listed in the questionable category may be very untrustworthy and should be fact checked on a per article basis
critiquing one 's own candidate must be such a baffling unthinkable concept for conservatism republicans and maga in particular
the debate was a disaster and biden deserves to be criticized for his performance in a democracy you should be able to criticize your leader without fear of retribution in a democracy you should be able to express your frustration side by side with your support that does n’t mean biden is a terrible president and that he is unqualified to remain in office he had a terrible debate now he needs to work to prove he is up for the job biden is always counted out and he always ends up winning i think the old man has what it takes to turn this around
if fox new is put this out then i guess i stick with biden only fools would suddenly think this was such a disaster if our mortal foes are putting out this do n't let biden be candidate nonsense
jesus the hand wringing over the debate is ridiculous
sometimes i take a picture of dog shit and hit up this rag to see if they wanna run it as a story
after the debate the cnn commentators talked for 27 minutes before any of them said the words lies or lying apparently giving a raving madman a platform on which to spew hateful misinformation for 90 minutes is better for business than you know disseminating facts
their reaction was more embarrassing than biden ’s performance so unprofessional and melodramatic
did you see rachel maddow and joy reid massive crying and coping on live tv it was incredible to see
i 'm glad biden supporters are scared if they are scared maybe they wo n't sit at home come november and actually vote
fox news lol why is this joke allowed to continue it 's getting old and very tired
i know fox is n't an actual news source but honestly have their ever put out anything that was n't completely made up you have this debate that biden totally messed up and instead of simply going with that they pull shit out of their ass as usual i mean this was their chance and they still f'd it up
the sheer amount of copium in this thread is staggering
sad day to be a biden supporter
paywall bypass selection 1391 0 1391 109 prominent figures on abc cnn msnbc and nbc admitted biden is no longer the best choice to run for president scores of staunch biden allies in the liberal media are turning against president biden following his widely panned debate performance that had pundits and democrats calling for him to and pass the baton shortly after the debate msnbc 's joy reid suggested that the president failed at his job of settling the democratic party and assuaging their concerns about his ability to win the 2024 election joe biden 's job was to reassure them tonight reid said his job was to calm his party to make them feel that yes i can do this i have four more years in me i have the ability and the stamina and the strength to do four more years he did not do that he did the opposite of that he made them more panicked reid also admitted that her phone did not stop buzzing throughout the debate as political operatives campaign operatives and democrats were approaching a state of panic morning joe co host joe scarborough who recently lambasted that suggested biden 's mental acuity was slipping declared his love for the president on friday but admitted his debate performance calls into question whether he should run for re election if he were ceo and he turned in a performance like that would any corporation in america any fortune 500 corporation in america keep him on as ceo the host said later scarborough said biden tragically did not rise to the occasion last night nbc news ' chuck todd declared that biden looked like the caricature conservatives have painted of him specifically over his mental acuity the debate came after a flood of liberal anger toward a wall street journal report earlier this month that raised questions about the president 's viability and there were no clips tonight right you saw it before your eyes todd said the reaction to biden 's performance was just as dire over on cnn cnn analysts surrounding biden in the immediate aftermath of the 90 minute face off with trump cnn political commentator and former obama adviser van jones seemed close to tears during the roundtable discussion after the debate i just want to speak for my heart i love that guy he 's a good man he loves his country he 's doing the best that he can but he had a test to meet tonight to restore confidence of the country and of the base and he failed to do that and i think there 's a lot of people who are going to want to see him consider taking a different course now he said
lol anyone that watched the debate knows this guy had no clue where he was
extreme bias consistent promotion of propaganda conspiracies poor or no sourcing to credible information a complete lack of transparency and or is fake news so half the sources posted here
i mean they critique just without nuance rino is a critique just an incredibly stupid one
bunch of sycophants incapable of critical thought much less with a critical eye toward their god emperor who no matter how fucked up he actually is can do no wrong in their deluded eyes
the ultimate conundrum was i wrong this whole time was i duped by a lifetime con man nah libs are bad trump gets it
oh my the optimism is strong in this one
foxnews msnbc abc cnn they are all saying the same thing at the moment
what are they supposed to do that they have n't been doing the laziest effort possible
they are spineless and do n’t care about policy biden was supposed to run in 2016 and they shut him down because optics looked better for hillary so now they waited on a middle of the road democrat that can pave the way for more progressive policies and he ’s too old
you should say copium around some people over 35
nah we 're not reading maga propaganda
all us mainstream media basically it ’s just propaganda
then why do republicans in congress if they oppose trump get called republican in name only and get censured or booted out of the party
what do they disagree with him about
yeah corporate media designed to get clicks and views i stand by my point if biden is so awful so destined to lose why continue to advocate replacing him why not let trump just coast to victory any media entity that is actively pushing this dems in disarray planning to replace biden whitmer newsome for the win wants democratic supporters to believe this should will happen or worse demand it of party leaders joe biden is the boogey many under trump 's bed hence why he remains the best option to win
cnn got bought by a conservative billionaire who praises fox
i 'm not a biden supporter supporter sooo i ca n't complain
there ’s a group of undecided voters in each swing state that are gon na decide this election and biden just lost an astounding number of them if they stay the course they will lose i promise you
are n’t you though i mean the net result of your actions is helping biden
i ’m good i was asking you what they oppose not for their website
so these people you speak of were still undecided after 34 felonies but have now finally made up their minds after an old guy looked his age during a debate
biden ca n't help himself what the fuck are you talking about bro
34 felonies of what exactly paying off a pornstar it does no damage to trump because people already assume he was having sex with prostitutes and paying them off having a candidate that would n’t be able to hang in a elementary school debate is absolutely a massive problem
the holy trinity of what could have beens i 'm sure gavin is just waiting for the call
oh i mean you ’re going to various threads and being annoying a lot of people are upset and disheartened right now but you know snaps people out of that real good spite by being weird and annoying you are motivating people to pick themselves up to not give in to apathy and to support biden just to prove you wrong it ’s the best thing biden could ask for right now so thanks biden supporter supporter you ’re making our lives that much easier i ’m sure biden appreciates your efforts as well
paying off a pornstar it does no damage to trump because people already assume he was having sex with prostitutes and paying them off no that s not what he was charged with
that ’s what people think the case is about
